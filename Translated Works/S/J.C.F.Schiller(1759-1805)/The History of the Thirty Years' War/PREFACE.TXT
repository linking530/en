The present is the only collected edition of the principal works of Schiller

which is accessible to English readers.  Detached poems or dramas have been

translated at various times, and sometimes by men of eminence,

since the first publication of the original works;

and in several instances these versions have been incorporated,

after some revision or necessary correction, into the following collection;

but on the other hand a large proportion of the contents have been

specially translated for this edition, in which category are

the historical works which occupy this volume and a portion of the next.



Schiller was not less efficiently qualified by nature for an historian

than for a dramatist.  He was formed to excel in all departments

of literature, and the admirable lucidity of style and soundness

and impartiality of judgment displayed in his historical writings

will not easily by surpassed, and will always recommend them

as popular expositions of the periods of which they treat.



Since the first publication of this edition many corrections and improvements

have been made, with a view to rendering it as acceptable as possible

to English readers.
