                          BOOK I     [1712-1728]



  I HAVE begun on a work which is without precedent, whose

accomplishment will have no imitator. I propose to set before my

fellow-mortals a man in all the truth of nature; and this man shall be

myself.

  I have studied mankind and know my heart; I am not made like any one

I have been acquainted with, perhaps like no one in existence; if

not better, I at least claim originality, and whether Nature has acted

rightly or wrongly in destroying the mold in which she cast me, can

only be decided after I have been read.

  I will present myself, whenever the last trumpet shall sound, before

the Sovereign Judge with this book in my hand, and loudly proclaim,

"Thus have I acted; these were my thoughts; such was I. With equal

freedom and veracity have I related what was laudable or wicked, I

have concealed no crimes, added no virtues; and if I have sometimes

introduced superfluous ornament, it was merely to occupy a void

occasioned by defect of memory: I may have supposed that certain,

which I only knew to be probable, but have never asserted as truth,

a conscious falsehood. Such as I was, I have declared myself;

sometimes vile and despicable, at others, virtuous, generous, and

sublime; even as Thou hast read my inmost soul: Power Eternal!

assemble round Thy throne an innumerable throng of my

fellow-mortals, let them listen to my confessions, let them blush at

my depravity, let them tremble at my sufferings; let each in his

turn expose with equal sincerity the failings, the wanderings of his

heart, and if he dare, aver, I was better than that man."

  I was born at Geneva, in 1712, son of Isaac Rousseau and Susannah

Bernard, citizens. My father's share of a moderate competency, which

was divided among fifteen children, being very trivial, his business

of a watchmaker (in which he had the reputation of great ingenuity)

was his only dependence. My mother's circumstances were more affluent;

she was daughter of a Mons. Bernard, minister, and possessed a

considerable share of modesty and beauty; indeed, my father found some

difficulty in obtaining her hand.

  The affection they entertained for each other was almost as early as

their existence; at eight or nine years old they walked together every

evening on the banks of the Treille, and before they were ten, could

not support the idea of separation. A natural sympathy of soul

confined those sentiments of predilection which habit at first

produced; born with minds susceptible of the most exquisite

sensibility and tenderness, it was only necessary to encounter similar

dispositions; that moment fortunately presented itself, and each

surrendered a willing heart.

  The obstacles that opposed served only to give a degree of

vivacity to their affection, and the young lover, not being able to

obtain his mistress, was overwhelmed with sorrow and despair. She

advised him to travel- to forget her. He consented- he traveled but

returned more passionate than ever, and had the happiness to find

her equally constant, equally tender. After this proof of mutual

affection, what could they resolve?- to dedicate their future lives to

love! the resolution was ratified with a vow, on which Heaven shed its

benediction.

  Fortunately, my mother's brother, Gabriel Bernard, fell in love with

one of my father's sisters: she had no objection to the match, but

made the marriage of his sister with her brother an indispensable

preliminary. Love soon removed every obstacle, and the two weddings

were celebrated the same day: thus my uncle became the husband of my

aunt, and their children were doubly cousins german. Before a year was

expired, both had the happiness to become fathers, but were soon after

obliged to submit to a separation.

  My uncle Bernard, who was an engineer, went to serve in the empire

and Hungary, under Prince Eugene, and distinguished himself both at

the siege and battle of Belgrade. My father, after the birth of my

only brother, set off, on recommendation, for Constantinople, and

was appointed watchmaker to the Seraglio. During his absence, the

beauty, wit, and accomplishments* of my mother attracted a number of

admirers, among whom Mons. de la Closure, Resident of France, was

the most assiduous in his attentions. His passion must have been

extremely violent, since after a period of thirty years I have seen

him affected at the very mention of her name. My mother had a

defense more powerful even than her virtue; she tenderly loved my

father, and conjured him to return; his inclination seconding his

request, he gave up every prospect of emolument, and hastened to

Geneva.



  * They were too brilliant for her situation, the minister, her

father, having bestowed great pains on her education. She was taught

drawing, singing, and to play on the theorbo; had learning, and

wrote very agreeable verses. The following is an extempore piece which

she composed in the absence of her husband and brother, in a

conversation with some person relative to them, while walking with her

sister-in-law, and their two children:



          Ces deux messieurs, qui sont absens,

            Nous sont chers de bien des manieres;

          Ce sont nos amis, nos amans,

            Ce sont nos maris et nos freres,

          Et les peres de ces enfans.



          These absent ones, who justly claim

          Our hearts, by every tender name,

            To whom each wish extends:

          Our husbands and our brothers are,

          The fathers of this blooming pair,

            Our lovers and our friends.



  I was the unfortunate fruit of this return, being born ten months

after, in a very weakly and infirm state; my birth cost my mother

her life, and was the first of my misfortunes. I am ignorant how my

father supported her loss at that time, but I know he was ever after

inconsolable. In me he still thought he saw her he so tenderly

lamented, but could never forget that I had been the innocent cause of

his misfortune, nor did he over embrace me, but his sighs, the

convulsive pressure of his arms, witnessed that a bitter regret

mingled itself with his caresses, though, as may be supposed, they

were not on this account less ardent. When he said to me, "Jean

Jacques, let us talk of your mother," my usual reply was, "Yes,

father, but then, you know, we shall cry," and immediately the tears

started from his eyes. "Ah!" exclaimed he, with agitation, "Give me

back my wife; at least console me for her loss; fill up, dear boy, the

void she has left in my soul. Could I love thee thus wert thou only my

son?" Forty years after this loss he expired in the arms of a second

wife, but the name of the first still vibrated on his lips, still

was her image engraved on his heart.

  Such were the authors of my being: of all the gifts it had pleased

Heaven to bestow on them, a feeling heart was the only one that

descended to me; this had been the source of their felicity, it was

the foundation of all my misfortunes.

  I came into the world with so few signs of life, that they

entertained but little hope of preserving me, with the seeds of a

disorder that has gathered strength with years, and from which I am

now relieved at intervals, only to suffer a different, though more

intolerable evil. I owed my preservation to one of my father's

sisters, an amiable and virtuous girl, who took the most tender care

of me; she is yet living, nursing, at the age of fourscore, a

husband younger than herself, but worn out with excessive drinking.

Dear aunt! I freely forgive your having preserved my life, and only

lament that it is not in my power to bestow on the decline of your

days the tender solicitude and care you lavished on the first dawn

of mine. My nurse, Jaqueline, is likewise living, and in good

health- the hands that opened my eyes to the light of this world may

close them at my death. We suffer before we think; it is the common

lot of humanity. I experienced more than my proportion of it. I have

no knowledge of what passed prior to my fifth or sixth year; I

recollect nothing of learning to read, I only remember what effect the

first considerable exercise of it produced on my mind; and from that

moment I date an uninterrupted knowledge of myself.

  Every night, after supper, we read some part of a small collection

of romances which had been my mother's. My father's design was only to

improve me in reading, and he thought these entertaining works were

calculated to give me a fondness for it; but we soon found ourselves

so interested in the adventures they contained, that we alternately

read whole nights together, and could not bear to give over until at

the conclusion of a volume. Sometimes, in a morning, on hearing the

swallows at our window, my father, quite ashamed of this weakness,

would cry, "Come, come, let us go to bed; I am more a child than

thou art."

  I soon acquired, by this dangerous custom, not only an extreme

facility in reading and comprehending, but, for my age, a too intimate

acquaintance with the passions. An infinity of sensations were

familiar to me, without possessing any precise idea of the objects

to which they related- I had conceived nothing- I had felt the

whole. This confused succession of emotions did not retard the

future efforts of my reason, though they added an extravagant,

romantic notion of human life, which experience and reflection have

never been able to eradicate.

  My romance reading concluded with the summer of 1719, the

following winter was differently employed. My mother's library being

quite exhausted, we had recourse to that part of her father's which

had devolved to us; here we happily found some valuable books, which

was by no means extraordinary, having been selected by a minister that

truly deserved that title, in whom learning (which was the rage of the

times) was but a secondary commendation, his taste and good sense

being most conspicuous. The history of the Church and Empire by Le

Sueur, Bossuett's Discourses on Universal History, Plutarch's Lives,

the History of Venice by Nani, Ovid's Metamorphoses, La Bruyere,

Fontenelle's World, his Dialogues of the Dead, and a few volumes of

Moliere, were soon ranged in my father's closet, where, during the

hours he was employed in his business, I daily read them, with an

avidity and taste uncommon, perhaps unprecedented at my age.

  Plutarch presently became my greatest favorite. The satisfaction I

derived from the repeated readings I gave this author, extinguished my

passion for romances, and I shortly preferred Agesilaus, Brutus, and

Aristides, to Orondates, Artemenes, and Juba. These interesting

studies, seconded by the conversations they frequently occasioned with

my father, produced that republican spirit and love of liberty, that

haughty and invincible turn of mind, which rendered me impatient of

restraint or servitude, and became the torment of my life, as I

continually found myself in situations incompatible with these

sentiments. Incessantly occupied with Rome and Athens, conversing,

if I may so express myself, with their illustrious heroes; born the

citizen of a republic, of a father whose ruling passion was the love

of his country, I was fired with these examples; could fancy myself

a Greek or Roman, and readily give into the character of the personage

whose life I read; transported by the recital of any extraordinary

instance of fortitude or intrepidity, animation flashed from my

eyes, and gave my voice additional strength and energy. One day, at

table, while relating the fortitude of Scoevola, they were terrified

at seeing me start from my seat and hold my hand over a hot

chafing-dish, to represent more forcibly the action of that determined

Roman.

  My brother, who was seven years older than myself, was brought up to

my father's profession. The extraordinary affection they lavished on

me might be the reason he was too much neglected: this certainly was a

fault which cannot be justified. His education and morals suffered

by this neglect, and he acquired the habits of a libertine before he

arrived at an age to be really one. My father tried what effect

placing him with a master would produce, but he still persisted in the

same ill conduct. Though I saw him so seldom that it could hardly be

said we were acquainted, I loved him tenderly, and believe he had as

strong an affection for me as a youth of his dissipated turn of mind

could be supposed capable of. One day, I remember, when my father

was correcting him severely, I threw myself between them, embracing my

brother, whom I covered with my body, receiving the strokes designed

for him; I persisted so obstinately in my protection, that either

softened by my cries and tears, or fearing to hurt me most, his

anger subsided, and he pardoned his fault. In the end, my brother's

conduct became so bad that he suddenly disappeared, and we learned

some time after that he was in Germany, but he never wrote to us,

and from that day we heard no news of him: thus I became an only son.

  If this poor lad was neglected, it was quite different with his

brother, for the children of a king could not be treated with more

attention and tenderness than were bestowed on my infancy, being the

darling of the family; and what is rather uncommon, though treated

as a beloved, never a spoiled child; was never permitted, while

under paternal inspection, to play in the street with other

children; never had any occasion to contradict or indulge those

fantastical humors which are usually attributed to nature, but are

in reality the effects of an injudicious education. I had the faults

common to my age, was talkative, a glutton, and sometimes a liar; made

no scruple of stealing sweetmeats, fruits, or, indeed, any kind of

eatables; but never took delight in mischievous waste, in accusing

others, or tormenting harmless animals. I recollect, indeed, that

one day, while Madam Clot, a neighbor of ours, was gone to church, I

made water in her kettle; the remembrance even now makes me smile, for

Madam Clot (though, if you please, a good sort of creature) was one of

the most tedious grumbling old women I ever knew. Thus have I given

a brief, but faithful, history of my childish transgressions.

  How could I become cruel or vicious, when I had before my eyes

only examples of mildness, and was surrounded by some of the best

people in the world? My father, my aunt, my nurse, my relations, our

friends, our neighbors, all I had any connections with, did not obey

me, it is true, but loved me tenderly, and I returned their affection.

I found so little to excite my desires, and those I had were so seldom

contradicted, that I was hardly sensible of possessing any, and can

solemnly aver I was an absolute stranger to caprice until after I

had experienced the authority of a master.

  Those hours that were not employed in reading or writing with my

father, or walking with my governess, Jaqueline, I spent with my aunt;

and whether seeing her embroider, or hearing her sing, whether sitting

or standing by her side, I was ever happy. Her tenderness and

unaffected gayety, the charms of her figure and countenance, have left

such indelible impressions on my mind, that her manner, look, and

attitude, are still before my eyes; I recollect a thousand little

caressing questions; could describe her clothes, her head-dress, nor

have the two curls of fine black hair which hung on her temples,

according to the mode of that time, escaped my memory.

  Though my taste, or rather passion, for music, did not show itself

until a considerable time after, I am fully persuaded it is to her I

am indebted for it. She knew a great number of songs, which she sung

with great sweetness and melody. The serenity and cheerfulness which

were conspicuous in this lovely girl, banished melancholy, and made

all round her happy.

  The charms of her voice had such an affect on me, that not only

several of her songs have ever since remained on my memory, but some I

have not thought of from my infancy, as I grow old, return upon my

mind with a charm altogether inexpressible. Would any one believe that

an old dotard like me, worn out with care and infirmity, should

sometime surprise himself weeping like a child, and in a voice

querulous, and broken by age, muttering out one of those airs which

were the favorites of my infancy? There is one song in particular,

whose tune I perfectly recollect, but the words that compose the

latter half of it constantly refuse every effort to recall them,

though I have a confused idea of the rhymes. The beginning, with

what I have been able to recollect of the remainder, is as follows:



                 Tircis, je n'ose

               Ecouter ton Chalumeau

                 Sous l' Ormeau;

                 Car on en cause

               Deja dans notre hameau.

                ---      ---       ---

                          -un Berger

                          s'engager

                          sans danger,

           Et toujours l'epine est sous la rose.



  I have endeavored to account for the invincible charm my heart feels

on the recollection of this fragment, but it is altogether

inexplicable. I only know, that before I get to the end of it, I

always find my voice interrupted by tenderness, and my eyes suffused

with tears. I have a hundred times formed the resolution of writing to

Paris for the remainder of these words, if any one should chance to

know them: but I am almost certain the pleasure I take in the

recollection would be greatly diminished was I assured any one but

my poor aunt Susan had sung them.

  Such were my affections on entering this life. Thus began to form

and demonstrate itself a heart at once haughty and tender, a character

effeminate, yet invincible; which, fluctuating between weakness and

courage, luxury and virtue, has ever set me in contradiction to

myself; causing abstinence and enjoyment, pleasure and prudence,

equally to shun me.

  This course of education was interrupted by an accident, whose

consequences influenced the rest of my life. My father had a quarrel

ungenerous man, happening to bleed at the nose, in order to be

revenged, accused my father of having drawn his sword on him in the

city, and in consequence of this charge they were about to conduct

him to prison. He insisted (according to the law of this republic)

that the accuser should be confined at the same time; and, not being

able to obtain this, preferred a voluntary banishment for the

remainder of his life, to giving up a point by which he must

sacrifice his honor and liberty.

  I remained under the tuition of my uncle Bernard, who was at that

time employed in the fortifications of Geneva. He had lost his

eldest daughter, but had a son about my own age, and we were sent

together to Bossey, to board with the Minister Lambercier. Here we

were to learn Latin, with all the insignificant trash that has

obtained the name of education.

  Two years spent in this village softened, in some degree, my Roman

fierceness, and again reduced me to a state of childhood. At Geneva,

where nothing was exacted, I loved reading, which was, indeed, my

principal amusement; but, at Bossey, where application was expected, I

was fond of play as a relaxation. The country was so new, so

charming in my idea, that it seemed impossible to find satiety in

its enjoyments, and I conceived a passion for rural life, which time

has not been able to extinguish; nor have I ever ceased to regret

the pure and tranquil pleasures I enjoyed at this place in my

childhood; the remembrance having followed me through every age,

even to that in which I am hastening again towards it.

  M. Lambercier was a worthy, sensible man, who, without neglecting

our instruction, never made our acquisitions burthensome, or tasks

tedious. What convinces me of the rectitude of his method is, that

notwithstanding my extreme aversion to restraint, the recollection

of my studies is never attended with disgust; and, if my improvement

was trivial, it was obtained with ease, and has never escaped memory.

  The simplicity of this rural life was of infinite advantage in

opening my heart to the reception of true friendship. The sentiments I

had hitherto formed on this subject were extremely elevated, but

altogether imaginary. The habit of living in this peaceful manner soon

united me tenderly to my cousin Bernard; my affection was more

ardent than that I had felt for my brother, nor has time ever been

able to efface it. He was a tall, lank, weakly boy, with a mind as

mild as his body was feeble, and who did not wrong the good opinion

they were disposed to entertain for the son of my guardian. Our

studies, amusements, and tasks, were the same; we were alone; each

wanted a playmate; to separate would, in some measure, have been to

annihilate us. Though we had not many opportunities of demonstrating

our attachment to each other, it was certainly extreme; and so far

from enduring the thought of separation, we could not even form an

idea that we should ever be able to submit to it. Each of a

disposition to be won by kindness, and complaisant, when not soured by

contradiction, we agreed in every particular. If, by the favor of

those who governed us he had the ascendant while in their presence,

I was sure to acquire it when we were alone, and this preserved the

equilibrium so necessary in friendship. If he hesitated in repeating

his task, I prompted him; when my exercises were finished, I helped to

write his; and, in our amusements, my disposition being most active,

ever had the lead. In a word, our characters accorded so well, and the

friendship that subsisted between us was so cordial, that during the

five years we were at Bossey and Geneva we were inseparable: we

often fought, it is true, but there never was any occasion to separate

us. No one of our quarrels lasted more than a quarter of an hour,

and never in our lives did we make any complaint of each other. It may

be said, these remarks are frivolous; but, perhaps, a similar

example among children can hardly be produced.

  The manner in which I passed my time at Bossey was so agreeable to

my disposition, that it only required a longer duration absolutely

to have fixed my character, which would have had only peaceable,

affectionate, benevolent sentiments for its basis. I believe no

individual of our kind ever possessed less natural vanity than myself.

At intervals, by an extraordinary effort, I arrived at sublime

ideas, but presently sunk again into my original languor. To be

beloved by every one who knew me was my most ardent wish. I was

naturally mild, my cousin was equally so, and those who had the care

of us were of similar dispositions. Everything contributed to

strengthen those propensities which nature had implanted in my breast,

and during the two years I was neither the victim nor witness of any

violent emotions.

  I knew nothing so delightful as to see every one content; not only

with me, but all that concerned them. When repeating our catechism

at church, nothing could give me greater vexation, on being obliged to

hesitate, than to see Miss Lambercier's countenance express

disapprobation and uneasiness. This alone was more afflicting to me

than the shame of faltering before so many witnesses, which,

notwithstanding, was sufficiently painful; for though not

over-solicitous of praise, I was feelingly alive to shame; yet I can

truly affirm, the dread of being reprimanded by Miss Lambercier

alarmed me less than the thought of making her uneasy.

  Neither she nor her brother were deficient in a reasonable severity,

but as this was scarce ever exerted without just cause, I was more

afflicted at their disapprobation than the punishment. Certainly the

method of treating youth would be altered if the distant effects, this

indiscriminate, and frequently indiscreet method produces, were more

conspicuous. I would willingly excuse myself from a further

explanation, did not the lesson this example conveys (which points out

an evil as frequent as it is pernicious) forbid my silence.

  As Miss Lambercier felt a mother's affection, she sometimes

exerted a mother's authority, even to inflicting on us, when we

deserved it, the punishment of infants. She had often threatened it,

and this threat of a treatment entirely new, appeared to me

extremely dreadful; but I found the reality much less terrible than

the idea, and what is still more unaccountable, this punishment

increased my affection for the person who had inflicted it. All this

affection, aided by my natural mildness, was scarcely sufficient to

prevent my seeking, by fresh offenses, a return of the same

chastisement; for a degree of sensuality had mingled with the smart

and shame, which left more desire than fear of a repetition. I was

well convinced the same discipline from her brother would have

produced a quite contradictory effect; but from a man of his

disposition this was not probable, and if I abstained from meriting

correction, it was merely from a fear of offending Miss Lambercier,

for benevolence, aided by the passions, has ever maintained an

empire over me which has given law to my heart.

  This event, which, though desirable, I had not endeavored to

accelerate, arrived without my fault; I should say, without my

seeking; and I profited by it with a safe conscience; but this second,

was also the last time, for Miss Lambercier, who doubtless had some

reason to imagine this chastisement did not produce the desired

effect, declared it was too fatiguing, and that she renounced it for

the future. Till now we had slept in her chamber, and during the

winter, even in her bed; but two days after another room was

prepared for us.

  Who would believe this childish discipline, received at eight

years old, from the hand of a woman of thirty, should influence my

propensities, my desires, my passions, for the rest of my life, and

that in quite a contrary sense from what might naturally have been

expected? The very incident that inflamed my senses, gave my desires

such an extraordinary turn, that, confined to what I had already

experienced, I sought no further, and, with blood boiling with

sensuality almost from my birth, preserved my purity beyond the age

when the coldest constitutions lose their sensibility; long tormented,

without knowing by what, I gazed on every handsome woman with delight;

imagination incessantly brought their charms to my remembrance, only

to transform them into so many Miss Lamberciers. Even after having

attained the marriageable age this odd taste still continued and drove

me nearly to depravity and madness.

  If ever education was perfectly chaste, it certainly that I

received; my three aunts were of exemplary prudence. My father, it

is true, loved pleasure, but his gallantry was rather of the last than

the present century. At M. Lambercier's a good maidservant was

discharged for having once made use of an expression before us which

was thought to contain some degree of indelicacy. I entertained a

particular aversion for courtesans, nor could I look on a rake without

a degree of disdain mingled with terror. My aversion for lewdness went

so far, since one day I walked through a hollow in the road at Petit

Sacconez; I saw on both sides cavities in the earth and was told

that it was there the people did their pairing. When I thought of

it, it came to my mind, that I had seen dogs in a similar situation,

and my heart revolted at the remembrance.

  These prejudices of education, proper in themselves to retard the

first explosions of a combustible constitution, were strengthened,

as I have already hinted, by the effect the first moments of

sensuality produced in me, for notwithstanding the troublesome

ebullition of my blood, I was satisfied with the species of

voluptuousness I had already been acquainted with, and sought no

further. I never went to the other species of voluptuousness and had

no suspicion that I was so near it. In my crazy fancies during my

erotic passions and while I was committing extravagant acts, I

borrowed the help of the other sex in my imagination.

  Thus I passed the age of puberty, with a constitution extremely

ardent, without knowing or even wishing for any other gratification of

the passions than what Miss Lambercier had innocently given me an idea

of; and when I became a man, that childish taste, instead of

vanishing, only associated with the other that I never could remove

from my sensual desires. This folly, joined to a natural timidity, has

always prevented my being very enterprising with women, so that I have

passed my days in languishing in silence for those I most admired,

without daring to disclose my wishes.

  To fall at the feet of an imperious mistress, obey her mandates,

or implore pardon, were for me the most exquisite enjoyments, and

the more my blood was inflamed by the efforts of a lively

imagination the more I acquired the appearance of a whining lover.

  It will be readily conceived that this mode of making love is not

attended with a rapid progress or imminent danger to the virtue of its

object; yet, though I have few favors to boast of I have not been

excluded from enjoyment, however imaginary. Thus the senses, in

concurrence with a mind equally timid and romantic, have preserved

my morals chaste, and feelings uncorrupted, with precisely the same

inclinations, which, seconded with a moderate portion of effrontery,

might have plunged me into the most unwarrantable excesses.

  I have made the first, most difficult step, in the obscure and

painful maze of my Confessions. We never feel so great a degree of

repugnance in divulging what is really criminal, as what is merely

ridiculous. I am now assured of my resolution, for after what I have

dared disclose, nothing can have power to deter me. The difficulty

attending these acknowledgments will be readily conceived, when I

declare, that during the whole of my life, though frequently

laboring under the most violent agitation, being hurried away with the

impetuosity of passion I could never, in the course of the most

unbounded familiarity, acquire sufficient courage to declare my folly,

and implore the only favor that remained to bestow. That has only once

happened, when a child, with a girl of my own age; even then it was

she who first proposed it.

  In thus investigating the first traces of my sensible existence, I

find elements, which, though seemingly incompatible, have united to

produce a simple and uniform effect; while others, apparently the

same, have, by the concurrence of certain circumstances, formed such

different combinations, that it would never be imagined they had any

affinity; who would believe, for example, that one of the most

vigorous springs of my soul was tempered in the identical source

from whence luxury and ease mingled with my constitution and

circulated in my veins? Before I quit this subject, I will add a

striking instance of the different effects they produced.

  One day, while I was studying in a chamber contiguous to the

kitchen, the maid set some of Miss Lambercier's combs to dry by the

fire, and on coming to fetch them some time after, was surprised to

find the teeth of one of them broken off. Who could be suspected of

this mischief? No one but myself had entered the room: I was

questioned, but denied having any knowledge of it. Mr. and Miss

Lambercier consult, exhort, threaten, but all to no purpose; I

obstinately persist in the denial; and, though this was the first time

I had been detected in a confirmed falsehood, appearances were so

strong that they overthrew all my protestations. This affair was

thought serious; the mischief, the lie, the obstinacy, were considered

equally deserving of punishment, which was not now to be

administered by Miss Lambercier. My uncle Bernard was written to; he

arrived; and my poor cousin being charged with a crime no less

serious, we were conducted to the same execution, which was

inflicted with great severity. If finding a remedy in the evil itself,

they had sought ever to allay my depraved desires, they could not have

chosen a shorter method to accomplish their designs, and, I can assure

my readers, I was for a long time freed from the dominion of them.

  As this severity could not draw from me the expected acknowledgment,

which obstinacy brought on several repetitions, and reduced me to a

deplorable situation, yet I was immovable, and resolutely determined

to suffer death rather than submit. Force, at length, was obliged to

yield to the diabolical infatuation of a child, for no better name was

bestowed on my constancy, and I came out of this dreadful trial, torn,

it is true, but triumphant. Fifty years have expired since this

adventure- the fear of punishment is no more. Well, then, I aver, in

the face of Heaven, I was absolutely innocent: and, so far from

breaking, or even touching the comb, never came near the fire. It will

be asked, how did this mischief happen? I can form no conception of

it, I only know my own innocence.

  Let any one figure to himself a character whose leading traits

were docility and timidity, but haughty, ardent, and invincible, in

its passions; a child, hitherto governed by the voice of reason,

treated with mildness, equity, and complaisance, who could not even

support the idea of injustice, experiencing, for the first time, so

violent an instance of it, inflicted by those he most loved and

respected. What perversion of ideas! What confusion in the heart,

the brain, in all my little being, intelligent and moral!- let any

one, I say, if possible, imagine all this, for I am incapable of

giving the least idea of what passed in my mind at that period.

  My reason was not sufficiently established to enable me to put

myself in the place of others, and judge how much appearances

condemned me, I only beheld the rigor of a dreadful chastisement,

inflicted for a crime I had not committed; yet I can truly affirm, the

smart I suffered, though violent, was inconsiderable to what I felt

from indignation, rage, and despair. My cousin, who was almost in

similar circumstances, having been punished for an involuntary

fault, as guilty of a premeditated crime, became furious by my

example. Both in the same bed, we embraced each other with

convulsive transport; we were almost suffocated; and when our young

hearts found sufficient relief to breathe out our indignation, we

sat up in the bed, and with all our force, repeated a hundred times,

Carnifex! Carnifex! Carnifex! Executioner, tormentor.

  Even while I write this I feel my pulse quicken, and should I live a

hundred thousand years, the agitation of that moment would still be

fresh in my memory. The first instance of violence and oppression is

so deeply engraven on my soul, that every relative idea renews my

emotion: the sentiment of indignation, which in its origin had

reference only to myself, has acquired such strength, and is at

present so completely detached from personal motives, that my heart is

as much inflamed at the sight or relation of any act of injustice

(whatever may be the object, or wheresoever it may be perpetrated)

as if I was the immediate sufferer. When I read the history of a

merciless tyrant, or the dark and the subtle machination of a

knavish designing priest, I could on the instant set off to stab the

miscreants, though I was certain to perish in the attempt.

  I have frequently fatigued myself by running after and stoning a

cock, a cow, a dog, or any animal I saw tormenting another, only

because it was conscious of possessing superior strength. This may

be natural to me, and I am inclined to believe it is, though the

lively impression of the first injustice I became the victim of was

too long and too powerfully remembered not to have added

considerable force to it.

  This occurrence terminated my infantine serenity; from that moment I

ceased to enjoy a pure unadulterated happiness, and on a retrospection

of the pleasures of my childhood, I yet feel they ended here. We

continued at Bossey some months after this event, but were like our

first parents in the Garden of Eden after they had lost their

innocence; in appearance our situation was the same, in effect it

was totally different.

  Affection, respect, intimacy, confidence, no longer attached the

pupils to their guides; we beheld them no longer as divinities, who

could read the secrets of our hearts; we were less ashamed of

committing faults, more afraid of being accused of them: we learned to

dissemble, to rebel, to lie: all the vices common to our years began

to corrupt our happy innocence, mingle with our sports, and embitter

our amusements. The country itself, losing those sweet and simple

charms which captivate the heart, appeared a gloomy desert, or covered

with a veil that concealed its beauties. We cultivated our little

gardens no more: our flowers were neglected. We no longer scratched

away the mold, and broke out into exclamations of delight, on

discovering that the grain we had sown began to shoot. We were

disgusted with our situation; our preceptors were weary of us. In a

word, my uncle wrote for our return, and we left Mr. and Miss

Lambercier without feeling any regret at the separation.

  Near thirty years passed away from my leaving Bossey, without once

recalling the place to my mind with any degree of satisfaction; but

after having passed the prime of life, as I decline into old age

(while more recent occurrences are wearing out apace) I feel these

remembrances revive and imprint themselves on my heart, with a force

and charm that every day acquires fresh strength; as if, feeling

life flee from me, I endeavored to catch it again by its commencement.

The most trifling incidents of those happy days delight me, for no

other reason than being of those days, I recall every circumstance

of time, place, and persons; I see the maid or footman busy in the

chamber, a swallow entering the window, a fly settling on my hand

while repeating my lesson. I see the whole economy of the apartment;

on the right hand Mr. Lambercier's closet, with a print representing

all the popes, a barometer, a large almanac, the windows of the

house (which stood in a hollow at the bottom of the garden) shaded

by raspberry shrubs, whose shoots sometimes found entrance; I am

sensible the reader has no occasion to know all this, but I feel a

kind of necessity for relating it. Why am I not permitted to recount

all the little anecdotes of that thrice happy age, at the recollection

of whose joys I even tremble with delight? Five or six particularly-

let us compromise the matter- I will give up five, but then I must

have one, and only one, provided I may draw it out to its utmost

length, in order to prolong my satisfaction.

  If I only sought yours, I should choose that of Miss Lambercier's

backside, which, by an unlucky fall at the bottom of the meadow, was

exposed to the view of the King of Sardinia, who happened to be

passing by; but that of the walnut tree on the terrace is more amusing

to me, since here I was an actor, whereas, in the above-mentioned

scene I was only a spectator, and I must confess I see nothing that

should occasion risibility in an accident, which, however laughable in

itself, alarmed me for a person I loved as a mother, or perhaps

something more.

  Ye curious readers, whose expectations are already on the stretch

for the noble history of the terrace, listen to the tragedy, and

abstain from trembling, if you can, at the horrible catastrophe.

  At the outside of the courtyard door, on the left hand, was a

terrace; here they often sat after dinner; but it was subject to one

inconvenience, being too much exposed to the rays of the sun; to

obviate this defect, Mr. Lambercier had a walnut tree set there, the

planting of which was attended with great solemnity. The two

boarders were godfathers, and while the earth was replacing round

the root, each held the tree with one hand, singing songs of

triumph. In order to water it with more effect, they formed a kind

of luson around its foot: myself and cousin, who were every day ardent

spectators of this watering, confirmed each other in the very

natural idea, that it was nobler to plant trees on the terrace than

colors on a breach, and this glory we were resolved to procure without

dividing it with any one.

  In pursuance of this resolution, we cut a slip off a willow, and

planted it on the terrace, at about eight or ten feet distance from

the august walnut tree. We did not forget to make a hollow round it,

but the difficulty was how to procure a supply of water, which was

brought from a considerable distance, and we not permitted to fetch

it: but water was absolutely necessary for our willow, and we made use

of every stratagem to obtain it.

  For a few days everything succeeded so well that it began to bud,

and throw out small leaves, which we hourly measured, convinced

(though now scarce a foot from the ground) it would soon afford us a

refreshing shade. This unfortunate willow, by engrossing our whole

time, rendered us incapable of application to any other study, and the

cause of our inattention not being known, we were kept closer than

before. The fatal moment approached when water must fail, and we

were already afflicted with the idea that our tree must perish with

drought. At length necessity, the parent of industry, suggested an

invention, by which we might save our tree from death, and ourselves

from despair; it was to make a furrow underground, which would

privately conduct a part of the water from the walnut tree to our

willow. This undertaking was executed with ardor, but did not

immediately succeed- our descent was not skillfully planned- the water

did not run, the earth falling in and stopping up the burrow; yet,

though all went contrary, nothing discouraged us, Labor omnia vincit

labor improbus. We made the basin deeper, to give the water a more

sensible descent; we cut the bottom of a box into narrow planks;

increased the channel from the walnut tree to our willow, and laying a

row flat at the bottom, set two others inclining towards each other,

so as to form a triangular channel; we formed a king of grating with

small sticks at the end next the walnut tree, to prevent the earth and

stones from stopping it up, and having carefully covered our work with

well-trodden earth, in a transport of hope and fear attended the

hour of watering. After an interval which seemed an age of

expectation, this hour arrived. Mr. Lambercier, as usual, assisted

at the operation; we contrived to get between him and our tree,

towards which he fortunately turned his back. They no sooner began

to pour the first pail of water, than we perceived it running to the

willow; this sight was too much for our prudence, and we involuntarily

expressed our transport by a shout of joy. The sudden exclamation made

Mr. Lambercier turn about, though at that instant he was delighted

to observe how greedily the earth, which surrounded the root of his

walnut tree, imbibed the water. Surprised at seeing two trenches

partake of it, he shouted in his turn, examines, perceives the

roguery, and, sending instantly for a pick axe, at one fatal blow

makes two or three of our planks fly, crying out meantime with all his

strength an aqueduct! an aqueduct! His strokes redoubled, every one of

which made an impression on our hearts; in a moment the planks, the

channel, the basin, even our favorite willow, all were plowed up,

nor was one word pronounced during this terrible transaction, except

the above-mentioned exclamation. An aqueduct! repeated he, while

destroying all our hopes, an aqueduct! an aqueduct!

  It may be supposed this adventure had a still more melancholy end

for the young architects; this, however, was not the case; the

affair ended here. Mr. Lambercier never reproached us on this

account nor was his countenance clouded with a frown; we even heard

him mention the circumstance to his sister with loud bursts of

laughter. The laugh of Mr. Lambercier might be heard to a considerable

distance. But what is still more surprising, after the first transport

of sorrow had subsided, we did not find ourselves violently afflicted;

we planted a tree in another spot, and frequently recollected the

catastrophe of the former, repeating with a significant emphasis, an

aqueduct! an aqueduct! Till then, at intervals, I had fits of

ambition, and could fancy myself Brutus or Aristides, but this was the

first visible effect of my vanity. To have constructed an aqueduct

with our own hands, to have set a slip of willow in competition with a

flourishing tree, appeared to me a supreme degree of glory! I had a

juster conception of it at ten, than Caesar entertained at thirty.

  The idea of this walnut tree, with the little anecdotes it gave rise

to, have so well continued, or returned to my memory, that the

design which conveyed the most pleasing sensations, during my

journey to Geneva, in the year 1754, was visiting Bossey, and

reviewing the monuments of my infantine amusement, above all, the

beloved walnut tree, whose age at that time must have been verging

on a third of a century, but I was so beset with company, that I could

not find a moment to accomplish my design. There is little

appearance now of the occasion being renewed; but should I ever return

to that charming spot, and find my favorite walnut tree still

existing, I am convinced I should water it with my tears.

  On my return to Geneva, I passed two or three years at my uncle's,

expecting the determination of my friends respecting my future

establishment. His own son being devoted to engineering, was taught

drawing, and instructed by his father in the elements of Euclid: I

partook of these instructions, but was principally fond of drawing.

Meantime they were irresolute, whether to make me a watchmaker, a

lawyer, or a minister. I should have preferred being a minister, as

I thought it must be a charming thing to preach, but the trifling

income which had been my mother's, and was to be divided between my

brother and myself, was too inconsiderable to defray the expense

attending the prosecution of my studies. As my age did not render

the choice very pressing, I remained with my uncle, passing my time

with very little improvement, and paying pretty dear, though not

unreasonably, for my board.

  My uncle, like my father, was a man of pleasure, but had not

learned, like him, to abridge his amusements for the sake of

instructing his family, consequently our education was neglected. My

aunt was a devotee, who loved singing psalms better than thinking of

our improvement, so that we were left entirely to ourselves, which

liberty we never abused.

  Ever inseparable, we were all the world to each other; and,

feeling no inclination to frequent the company of a number of

disorderly lads of our own age, we learned none of those habits of

libertinism to which our idle life exposed us. Perhaps I am wrong in

charging myself and cousin with idleness at this time, for, in our

lives, we were never less so; and what was extremely fortunate, so

incessantly occupied with our amusements, that we found no

temptation to spend any part of our time in the streets. We made

cages, pipes, kites, drums, houses, ships, and bows; spoiled the tools

of my good old grandfather by endeavoring to make watches in imitation

of him; but our favorite amusement was wasting paper, in drawing,

washing, coloring, etc. There came an Italian mountebank to Geneva,

called Gamber-Corta, who had an exhibition of puppets, that he made

play a kind of comedy. We went once to see them, but could not spare

time to go again, being busily employed in making puppets of our

own, and inventing comedies, which we immediately set about making

them perform, mimicking to the best of our abilities the uncouth voice

of Punch; and, to complete the business, my good aunt and uncle

Bernard had the patience to see and listen to our imitations; but my

uncle, having one day read an elaborate discourse to his family, we

instantly gave up our comedies, and began composing sermons.

  These details, I confess, are not very amusing, but they serve to

demonstrate that the former part of our education was well directed,

since being, at such an early age, the absolute masters of our time,

we found no inclination to abuse it; and so little in want of other

companions, that we constantly neglected every occasion of seeking

them. When taking our walks together, we observed their diversions

without feeling any inclination to partake of them. Friendship so

entirely occupied our hearts, that, pleased with each other's company,

the simplest pastimes were sufficient to delight us.

  We were soon remarked for being thus inseparable: and what

rendered us more conspicuous, my cousin was very tall, myself

extremely short, so that we exhibited a very whimsical contrast.

This meager figure, small, sallow countenance, heavy air, and supine

gait, excited the ridicule of the children, who, in the gibberish of

the country, nicknamed him Barna Bredanna; and we no sooner got out of

doors than our ears were assailed with a repetition of "Barna

Bredanna." He bore this indignity with tolerable patience, but I was

instantly for fighting. This was what the young rogues aimed at. I

engaged accordingly, and was beat. My poor cousin did all in his power

to assist me, but he was weak, and a single stroke brought him to

the ground. I then became furious, and received several smart blows,

some of which were aimed at Barna Bredanna. This quarrel so far

increased the evil, that, to avoid their insults, we could only show

ourselves in the streets while they were employed at school.

  I had already become a redresser of grievances; there only wanted

a lady in the way to be a knight-errant in form. This defect was

soon supplied; I presently had two. I frequently went to see my father

at Nion, a small city in the Vaudois country, where he was now

settled. Being universally respected, the affection entertained for

him extended to me; and, during my visits, the question seemed to

be, who should show me most kindness. A Madam de Vulson, in

particular, loaded me with caresses; and, to complete all, her

daughter made me her gallant. I need not explain what kind of

gallant a boy of eleven must be to a girl of two and twenty; the

artful hussies know how to set these puppets up in front, to conceal

more serious engagements. On my part, I saw no inequality between

myself and Miss Vulson, was flattered by the circumstance, and went

into it with my whole heart, or rather my whole head, for this passion

certainly reached no further, though it transported me almost to

madness, and frequently produced scenes sufficient to make even a

cynic expire with laughter.

  I have experienced two kinds of love, equally real, which have

scarce any affinity, yet each differing materially from tender

friendship. My whole life has been divided between these affections,

and I have frequently felt the power of both at the same instant.

For example, at the very time I so publicly and tyrannically claimed

Miss Vulson, that I could not suffer any other of my sex to approach

her, I had short, but passionate, assignations with a Miss Goton,

who thought proper to act the schoolmistress with me. Our meetings,

though absolutely childish, afforded me the height of happiness. I

felt the whole charm of mystery, and repaid Miss Vulson in kind,

when she least expected it, the use she made of me in concealing her

amours. To my great mortification, this secret was soon discovered,

and I presently lost my young schoolmistress.

  Miss Goton was, in fact, a singular personage. She was not handsome,

yet there was a certain something in her figure which could not easily

be forgotten, and this for an old fool, I am too often convinced of.

Her eyes, in particular, neither corresponded with her age, her

height, nor her manner; she had a lofty imposing air which agreed

extremely well with the character she assumed, but the most

extraordinary part of her composition was a mixture of forwardness and

reserve difficult to be conceived; and while she took the greatest

liberties with me, would never permit any to be taken with her in

return, treating me precisely like a child. This makes me suppose

she had either ceased herself to be one, or was yet sufficiently so to

behold us play the danger to which this folly exposed her.

  I was so absolutely in the power of both these mistresses, that when

in the presence of either, I never thought of her who was absent; in

other respects, the effects they produced on me bore no affinity. I

could have passed my whole life with Miss Vulson, without forming a

wish to quit her; but then, my satisfaction was attended with a

pleasing serenity; and, in numerous companies, I was particularly

charmed with her. The sprightly sallies of her wit, the arch glance of

her eye, even jealousy itself, strengthened my attachment, and I

triumphed in the preference she seemed to bestow on me, while

addressed by more powerful rivals; applause, encouragement, and

smiles, gave animation to my happiness. Surrounded by a throng of

observers, I felt the whole force of love- I was passionate,

transported; in a tete-a-tete, I should have been constrained,

thoughtful, perhaps unhappy. If Miss Vulson was ill, I suffered with

her; would willingly have given up my own health to establish hers

(and, observe, I knew the want of it from experience); if absent,

she employed my thoughts, I felt the want of her; when present, her

caresses came with warmth and rapture to my heart, though my senses

were unaffected. The familiarities she bestowed on me I could not have

supported the idea of her granting to another; I loved her with a

brother's affection only, but experienced all the jealousy of a lover.

  With Miss Goton this passion might have acquired a degree of fury; I

should have been a Turk, a tiger, had I once imagined she bestowed her

favors on any but myself. The pleasure I felt on approaching Miss

Vulson was sufficiently ardent, though unattended with uneasy

sensations; but at sight of Miss Goton, I felt myself bewildered-

every sense was absorbed in ecstasy. I believe it would have been

impossible to have remained long with her; I must have been suffocated

with the violence of my palpitations. I equally dreaded giving

either of them displeasure; with one I was more complaisant; with

the other, more submissive. I would not have offended Miss Vulson

for the world; but if Miss Goton had commanded me to throw myself into

the flames, I think I should have instantly obeyed her. Happily,

both for her and myself, our amours, or rather rendezvous, were not of

long duration: and though my connection with Miss Vulson was less

dangerous, after a continuance of some greater length, that likewise

had its catastrophe; indeed the termination of a love affair is good

for nothing, unless it partakes of the romantic, and can furnish out

at least an exclamation.

  Though my correspondence with Miss Vulson was less animated, it

was perhaps more endearing; we never separated without tears, and it

can hardly be conceived what a void I felt in my heart. I could

neither think nor speak of anything but her. These romantic sorrows

were not affected, though I am inclined to believe they did not

absolutely center in her, for I am persuaded (though I did not

perceive it at that time) being deprived of amusement bore a

considerable share in them.

  To soften the rigor of absence, we agreed to correspond with each

other, and the pathetic expressions these letters contained were

sufficient to have split a rock. In a word, I had the honor of her not

being able to endure the pain of separation. She came to see me at

Geneva.

  My head was now completely turned; and during the two days she

remained here, I was intoxicated with delight. At her departure, I

would have thrown myself into the water after her, and absolutely rent

the air with my cries. The week following she sent me sweetmeats,

gloves, etc. This certainly would have appeared extremely gallant, had

I not been informed of her marriage at the same instant, and that

the journey I had thought proper to give myself the honor of, was only

to buy her wedding suit.

  My indignation may easily be conceived; I shall not attempt to

describe it. In this heroic fury, I swore never more to see the

perfidious girl, supposing it the greatest punishment that could be

inflicted on her. This, however, did not occasion her death, for

twenty years after while on a visit to my father, being on the lake, I

asked who those ladies were in a boat not far from ours. "What!"

said my father, smiling, "does not your heart inform you? It is your

former flame, it is Madam Christin, or, if you please, Miss Vulson." I

started at the almost forgotten name, and instantly ordered the

waterman to turn off, not judging it worth while to be perjured,

however favorable the opportunity for revenge, in renewing a dispute

of twenty years past, with a woman of forty.

  Thus, before my future destination was determined, did I fool away

the most precious moments of my youth. After deliberating a long

time on the bent of my natural inclination, they resolved to dispose

of me in a manner the most repugnant to them. I was sent to Mr.

Masseron, the City Register, to learn (according to the expression

of my uncle Bernard) the thriving occupation of a scraper. This

nickname was inconceivably displeasing to me, and I promised myself

but little satisfaction in the prospect of heaping up money by a

mean employment. The assiduity and subjection required completed my

disgust, and I never set foot in the office without feeling a kind

of horror, which every day gained fresh strength.

  Mr. Masseron, who was not better pleased with my abilities than I

was with the employment, treated me with disdain, incessantly

upbraiding me with being a fool and blockhead, not forgetting to

repeat, that my uncle had assured him I was a knowing one, though he

could not find that I knew anything. That he had promised to furnish

him with a sprightly boy, but had, in truth, sent him an ass. To

conclude, I was turned out of the registry, with the additional

ignominy of being pronounced a fool by all Mr. Masseron's clerks,

and fit only to handle a file.

  My vocation thus determined, I was bound apprentice; not, however,

to a watchmaker, but to an engraver, and I had been so completely

humiliated by the contempt of the register, that I submitted without a

murmur. My master, whose name was M. Ducommon, was a young man of a

very violent and boorish character, who contrived in a short time to

tarnish all the amiable qualities of my childhood, to stupefy a

disposition naturally sprightly, and reduce my feelings, as well as my

condition, to an absolute state of servitude. I forgot my Latin,

history, and antiquities; I could hardly recollect whether such people

as Romans ever existed. When I visited my father, he no longer

beheld his idol, nor could the ladies recognize the gallant Jean

Jacques; nay, I was so well convinced that Mr. and Miss Lambercier

would scarce receive me as their pupil, that I endeavored to avoid

their company, and from that time have never seen them. The vilest

inclinations, the basest actions, succeeded my amiable amusements, and

even obliterated the very remembrance of them. I must have had, in

spite of my good education, a great propensity to degenerate, else the

declension could not have followed with such ease and rapidity, for

never did so promising a Caesar so quickly become a Laradon.

  The art itself did not displease me. I had a lively taste for

drawing. There was nothing displeasing in the exercise of the

graver; and as it required no very extraordinary abilities to attain

perfection as a watchcase engraver, I hoped to arrive at it. Perhaps I

should have accomplished my design, if unreasonable restraint, added

to the brutality of my master, had not rendered my business

disgusting. I wasted his time, and employed myself in engraving

medals, which served me and my companions as a kind of insignia for

a new invented order of chivalry, and though this differed very little

from my usual employ, I considered it as a relaxation.

Unfortunately, my master caught me at this contraband labor, and a

severe beating was the consequence. He reproached me at the same

time with attempting to make counterfeit money, because our medals

bore the arms of the Republic, though, I can truly aver, I had no

conception of false money, and very little of the true, knowing better

how to make a Roman As than one of our threepenny pieces.

  My master's tyranny rendered insupportable that labor I should

otherwise have loved, and drove me to vices I naturally despised, such

as falsehood, idleness, and theft. Nothing ever gave me a clearer

demonstration of the difference between filial dependence and abject

slavery, than the remembrance of the change produced in me at that

period. Hitherto I had enjoyed a reasonable liberty; this I had

suddenly lost. I was enterprising at my father's, free at M.

Lambercier's, discreet at my uncle's; but, with my master, I became

fearful and from that moment my mind was vitiated. Accustomed to

live on terms of perfect equality, to be witness of no pleasures I

could not command, to see no dish I was not to partake of, or be

sensible of a desire I might not express; to be able to bring every

wish of my heart to my lips- what a transition!- at my master's I

was scarce allowed to speak, was forced to quit the table without

tasting what I most longed for, and the room when I had nothing

particular to do there; was incessantly confined to my work, while the

liberty my master and his journeymen enjoyed, served only to

increase the weight of my subjection. When disputes happened to arise,

though conscious that I understood the subject better than any of

them, I dared not offer my opinion; in a word, everything I saw became

an object of desire, for no other reason than because I was not

permitted to enjoy anything. Farewell gayety, ease, those happy

turns of expression, which formerly even made my faults escape

correction. I recollect, with pleasure, a circumstance that happened

at my father's, which even now makes me smile. Being for some fault

ordered to bed without my supper, as I was passing through the

kitchen, with my poor morsel of bread in my hand, I saw the meat

turning on the spit; my father and the rest were round the fire; I

must bow to every one as I passed. When I had gone through this

ceremony, leering with a wishful eye at the roast meat, which looked

so inviting, and smelt so savory, I could not abstain from making that

a bow likewise, adding in a pitiful tone, good-by, roast meat! This

unpremeditated pleasantry put them in such good humor, that I was

permitted to stay, and partake of it. Perhaps the same thing might

have produced a similar effect at my master's, but such a thought

could never have occurred to me, or, if it had, I should not have

had courage to express it.

  Thus I learned to covet, dissemble, lie, and, at length, to steal, a

propensity I never felt the least idea of before, though since that

time I have never been able entirely to divest myself of it. Desire

and inability united naturally led to this vice, which is the reason

pilfering is so common among footmen and apprentices, though the

latter, as they grow up, and find themselves in a situation where

everything is at their command, lose this shameful propensity. As I

never experienced the advantage, I never enjoyed the benefit.

  Good sentiments, ill directed, frequently lead children into vice.

Notwithstanding my continual wants and temptations, it was more than a

year before I could resolve to take even eatables. My first theft

was occasioned by complaisance, but it was productive of others

which had not so plausible an excuse.

  My master had a journeyman named Verrat, whose mother lived in the

neighborhood, and had a garden at a considerable distance from the

house, which produced excellent asparagus. This Verrat, who had no

great plenty of money, took it in his head to rob her of the most

early production of her garden, and by the sale of it procure those

indulgences he could not otherwise afford himself; not being very

nimble, he did not care to run the hazard of a surprise. After some

preliminary flattery, which I did not comprehend the meaning of, he

proposed this expedition to me, as an idea which had that moment

struck him. At first I would not listen to the proposal; but he

persisted in his solicitation, and as I could never resist the attacks

of flattery, at length prevailed. In pursuance of this virtuous

resolution, I every morning repaired to the garden, gathered the

best of the asparagus, and took it to the Molard where some good old

women, who guessed how I came by it, wishing to diminish the price,

made no secret of their suspicions; this produced the desired

effect, for, being alarmed, I took whatever they offered, which

being taken to Mr. Verrat, was presently metamorphosed into a

breakfast, and divided with a companion of his; for, though I procured

it, I never partook of their good cheer, being fully satisfied with an

inconsiderable bribe.

  I executed my roguery with the greatest fidelity, seeking only to

please my employer; and several days passed before it came into my

head to rob the robber, and tithe Mr. Verrat's harvest. I never

considered the hazard I run in these expeditions, not only of a

torrent of abuse, but what I should have been still more sensible

of, a hearty beating; for the miscreant, who received the whole

benefit, would certainly have denied all knowledge of the fact, and

I should only have received a double portion of punishment for

daring to accuse him, since being only an apprentice, I stood no

chance of being believed in opposition to a journeyman. Thus in

every situation, powerful rogues know how to save themselves at the

expense of the feeble.

  This practice taught me it was not so terrible to thieve as I had

imagined; I took care to make this discovery turn to some account,

helping myself to everything within my reach, that I conceived an

inclination for. I was not absolutely ill-fed at my master's, and

temperance was only painful to me by comparing it with the luxury he

enjoyed. The custom of sending young people from table precisely

when those things are served up which seem most tempting, is

calculated to increase their longing, and induces them to steal what

they conceive to be so delicious. It may be supposed I was not

backward in this particular: in general my knavery succeeded pretty

well. though quite the reverse when I happened to be detected.

  I recollect an attempt to procure some apples, which was attended

with circumstances that make me smile and shudder even at this

instant. The fruit was standing in a pantry, which by a lattice at a

considerable height received light from the kitchen. One day, being

alone in the house, I climbed up to see these precious apples,

which, being out of my reach, made this pantry appear the garden of

Hesperides. I fetched the spit- tried if it would reach them- it was

too short- I lengthened it with a small one which was used for

game,- my master being very fond of hunting, darted at them several

times without success; at length was more fortunate; being transported

to find I was bringing up an apple, I drew it gently to the lattice-

was going to seize it, when (who can express my grief and

astonishment!) I found it would not pass through- it was too large.

I tried every expedient to accomplish my design, sought supporters

to keep the spits in the same position, a knife to divide the apple,

and a lath to hold it with; at length, I so far succeeded as to effect

the division, and made no doubt of drawing the pieces through; but

it was scarcely separated (compassionate reader, sympathize with my

affliction) when both pieces fell into the pantry.

  Though I lost time by this experiment, I did not lose courage,

but, dreading a surprise, I put off the attempt till next day, when

I hoped to be more successful, and returned to my work as if nothing

had happened, without once thinking of what the two obvious

witnesses I had left in the pantry deposed against me.

  The next day (a fine opportunity offering) I renew the trial. I

fasten the spits together: get on the stool; take aim; am just going

to dart at my prey- unfortunately the dragon did not sleep; the pantry

door opens, my master makes his appearance, and, looking up, exclaims,

"Bravo!"- The horror of that moment returns- the pen drops from my

hand.

  A continual repetition of ill treatment rendered me callous; it

seemed a kind of composition for my crimes, which authorized me to

continue them, and, instead of looking back at the punishment, I

looked forward to revenge. Being beat like a slave, I judged I had a

right to all the vices of one. I was convinced that to rob and be

punished were inseparable, and constituted, if I may so express

myself, a kind of traffic, in which, if I perform my part of the

bargain, my master would take care not to be deficient in his; that

preliminary settled, I applied myself to thieving with great

tranquility, and whenever this interrogatory occurred to my mind,

"What will be the consequence?" the reply was ready, "I know the

worst, I shall be beat; no matter, I was made for it."

  I love good eating; am sensual, but not greedy; I have such a

variety of inclinations to gratify, that this can never predominate;

and unless my heart is unoccupied, which very rarely happens, I pay

but little attention to my appetite: to purloining eatables, but

extended this propensity to everything I wished to possess, and if I

did not become a robber in form, it was only because money never

tempted me.

  My master had a closet in the workshop, which he kept locked; this I

contrived to open and shut as often as I pleased, and laid his best

tools, fine drawings, impressions, in a word, everything he wished

to keep from me, under contribution. These thefts were so far

innocent, that they were always employed in his service, but I was

transported at having the trifles in my possession, and imagined I

stole the art with its productions. Besides what I have mentioned, his

boxes contained threads of gold and silver, a number of small

jewels, valuable medals, and money; yet, though I seldom had five sous

in my pocket, I do not recollect ever having cast a wishful look at

them; on the contrary, I beheld these valuables rather with terror

than delight.

  I am convinced the dread of taking money was, in a great measure,

the effect of education. There was mingled with the idea of it the

fear of infamy, a prison, punishment, and death: had I even felt the

temptation, these objects would have made me tremble; whereas my

failings appeared a species of waggery, and, in truth, they were

little else; they could but occasion a good trimming, and this I was

already prepared for. A sheet of fine drawing-paper was a greater

temptation than money sufficient to have purchased a ream. This

unreasonable caprice is connected with one of the most striking

singularities of my character, and has so far influenced my conduct,

that it requires a particular explanation.

  My passions are extremely violent; while under their influence,

nothing can equal my impetuosity; I am an absolute stranger to

discretion, respect, fear, or decorum; rude, saucy, violent, and

intrepid: no shame can stop, no danger intimidate me. My mind is

frequently so engrossed by a single object, that beyond it the whole

world is not worth a thought; this is the enthusiasm of a moment,

the next, perhaps, I am plunged in a state of annihilation. Take me in

my moments of tranquility, I am indolence and timidity itself; a

word to speak, the least trifle to perform, appear an intolerable

labor; everything alarms and terrifies me; the very buzzing of a fly

will make me shudder: I am so subdued by fear and shame, that I

would gladly shield myself from mortal view.

  When obliged to exert myself, I am ignorant what to do! when

forced to speak, I am at a loss for words; and if any one looks at me,

I am instantly out of countenance. If animated with my subject, I

express my thoughts with ease, but, in ordinary conversations, I can

say nothing- absolutely nothing; and, being obliged to speak,

renders them insupportable.

  I may add, that none of my predominant inclinations center in

those pleasures which are to be purchased: money empoisons my

delights; I must have them unadulterated; I love those of the table,

for instance, but cannot endure the restraints of good company, or the

intemperance of taverns; I can enjoy them only with a friend, for

alone it is equally impossible; my imagination is then so occupied

with other things, that I find no pleasure in eating. Women who are to

be purchased have no charms for me; my beating heart cannot be

satisfied without affection; it is the same with every other

enjoyment, if not truly disinterested, they are absolutely insipid; in

a word, I am fond of those things which are only estimable to minds

formed for the peculiar enjoyment of them.

  I never thought money so desirable as it is usually imagined; if you

would enjoy, you must transform it; and this transformation is

frequently attended with inconvenience: you must bargain, purchase,

pay dear, be badly served, and often duped. I buy an egg, am assured

it is new-laid- I find it stale; fruit in its utmost perfection-

'tis absolutely green; a girl, and she is tainted. I love good wine,

but where shall I get it? Not at my wine merchant's- he will certainly

poison me. I wish to be universally respected; how shall I compass

my design? I must make friends, send messages, come, go, wait, and

be frequently deceived. Money is the perpetual source of uneasiness; I

fear it more than I love good wine.

  A thousand times, both during and since my apprenticeship, have I

gone out to purchase some nicety, I approach the pastry-cook's,

perceive some women at the counter, and imagine they are laughing at

me. I pass a fruit shop, see some fine pears, their appearance

tempts me; but then two or three young people are near, or a man I

am acquainted with is standing at the door; I take all that pass for

persons I have some knowledge of, and my near sight contributes to

deceive me; I am everywhere intimidated, restrained by some

obstacle, and with money in my pocket return as I went, for want of

resolution to purchase what I long for.

  I should enter into the most insipid details was I to relate the

trouble, shame, repugnance, and inconvenience of all kinds which I

have experienced in parting with my money, whether in my own person,

or by the agency of others; as I proceed, the reader will get

acquainted with my disposition, and perceive all this without my

troubling him with the recital.

  This once comprehended, one of my apparent contradictions will be

easily accounted for, and the most sordid avarice reconciled with

the greatest contempt of money. It is a movable which I consider of so

little value, that, when destitute of it, I never wish to acquire any;

and when I have a sum I keep it by me, for want of knowing how to

dispose of it to my satisfaction; but let an agreeable and

convenient opportunity present itself, and I empty my purse with the

utmost freedom; not that I would have the reader imagine I am

extravagant from a motive of ostentation, quite the reverse: it was

ever in subservience to my pleasures, and, instead of glorying in

expense, I endeavor to conceal it. I so well perceive that money is

not made to answer my purposes, that I am almost ashamed to have

any, and, still more, to make use of it.

  Had I ever possessed a moderate independence, I am convinced I

should have had no propensity to become avaricious. I should have

required no more, and cheerfully lived up to my income; but my

precarious situation has constantly and necessarily kept me in fear. I

love liberty, and I loathe constraint, dependence, and all their

kindred annoyances. As long as my purse contains money it secures my

independence, and exempts me from the trouble of seeking other

money, a trouble of which I have always had a perfect horror; and

the dread of seeing the end of my independence, makes me

proportionately unwilling to part with my money. The money that we

possess is the instrument of liberty, that which we lack and strive to

obtain is the instrument of slavery. Thence it is that I hold fast

to aught that I have, and yet covet nothing more.

  My disinterestedness, then, is in reality only idleness, the

pleasure of possessing is not in my estimation worth the trouble of

acquiring: and my dissipation is only another form of idleness; when

we have an opportunity of disbursing pleasantly we should make the

best possible use of it.

  I am less tempted by money than by other objects, because between

the moment of possessing the money and that of using it to obtain

the desired object there is always an interval, however short; whereas

to possess the thing is to enjoy it. I see a thing, and it tempts

me; but if I see not the thing itself but only the means of

acquiring it, I am not tempted. Therefore it is that I have been a

pilferer, and am so even now, in the way of mere trifles to which I

take a fancy, and which I find it easier to take than to ask for;

but I never in my life recollect having taken a farthing from any one,

except about fifteen years ago, when I stole seven francs and ten

sous. The story is worth recounting, as it exhibits a concurrence of

ignorance and stupidity I should scarcely credit, did it relate to any

but myself.

  It was in Paris: I was walking with M. de Franceul at the Palais

Royal: he pulled out his watch, he looked at it, and said to me,

"Suppose we go to the opera?"- "With all my heart." We go; he takes

two box tickets, gives me one, and enters himself with the other; I

follow, find the door crowded; and, looking in, see every one

standing; judging, therefore, that M. de Franceul might suppose me

concealed by the company, I go out, ask for my ticket, and, getting

the money returned, leave the house, without considering, that by then

I had reached the door every one would be seated, and M. de Franceul

might readily perceive I was not there.

  As nothing could be more opposite to my natural inclination than

this abominable meanness, I note it, to show there are moments of

delirium when men ought not to be judged by their actions: this was

not stealing the money, it was only stealing the use of it, and was

the more infamous for wanting the excuse of a temptation.

  I should never end these accounts, was I to describe all the

gradations through which I passed, during my apprenticeship, from

the sublimity of a hero to the baseness of a villain. Though I entered

into most of the vices of my situation, I had no relish for its

pleasures: the amusements of my companions were displeasing, and

when too much restraint had made my business wearisome, I had

nothing to amuse me. This renewed my taste for reading which had

long been neglected. I thus committed a fresh offense, books made me

neglect my work, and brought on additional punishment, while

inclination, strengthened by constraint, became an unconquerable

passion. La Tribu, a well-known librarian, furnished me with all

kinds: good or bad, I perused them with avidity, and without

discrimination.

  It will be said, "at length, then, money became necessary"- true;

but this happened at a time when a taste for study had deprived me

both of resolution and activity: totally occupied by this new

inclination, I only wished to read, I robbed no longer. This is

another of my peculiarities; a mere nothing frequently calls me off

from what I appear the most attached to; I give in to the new idea; it

becomes a passion, and immediately every former desire is forgotten.

  Reading was my new hobby; my heart beat with impatience to run

over the new book I carried in my pocket; the first moment I was

alone, I seized the opportunity to draw it out, and thought no

longer of rummaging my master's closet. I was even ashamed to think

I had been guilty of such meanness; and had my amusements been more

expensive, I no longer felt an inclination to continue it. La Tribu

gave me credit, and when once I had the book in my possession, I

thought no more of the trifle I was to pay for it; as money came it

naturally passed to this woman; and when she chanced to be pressing,

nothing was so conveniently at hand as my own effects; to steal in

advance required foresight, and robbing to pay was no temptation.

  The frequent blows I received from my master, with my private and

ill-chosen studies, rendered me reserved, unsociable, and almost

deranged my reason. Though my taste had not preserved me from silly

unmeaning books, by good fortune I was a stranger to licentious or

obscene ones: not that La Tribu (who was very accommodating) made

any scruple of lending these, on the contrary, to enhance their worth,

she spoke of them with an air of mystery; this produced an effect

she had not foreseen, for both shame and disgust made me constantly

refuse them. Chance so well seconded my bashful disposition, that I

was past the age of thirty before I saw any of those dangerous

compositions.

  In less than a year I had exhausted La Tribu's scanty library, and

was unhappy for want of further amusement. My reading, though

frequently bad, had worn off my childish follies, and brought back

my heart to nobler sentiments than my condition had inspired;

meantime, disgusted with all within my reach, and thinking

everything charming that was out of it, my present situation

appeared extremely miserable. My passions began to acquire strength, I

felt their influence, without knowing whither they would conduct me. I

was as far removed from actual enjoyment as if sexless. Sometimes I

thought of former follies, but sought no further.

  At this time my imagination took a turn which helped to calm my

increasing emotions; it was, to contemplate those situations in the

books I had read, which produced the most striking effect on my

mind; to recall, combine, and apply them to myself in such a manner,

as to become one of the personages my recollection presented, and be

continually in those fancied circumstances which were most agreeable

to my inclinations; in a word, by contriving to place myself in

these fictitious situations, the idea of my real one was in a great

measure obliterated.

  This fondness for imaginary objects, and the facility with which I

could gain possession of them, completed my disgust for everything

around me, and fixed that inclination for solitude which has ever

since been predominant. We shall have more than once occasion to

remark the effects of a disposition, misanthropic and melancholy in

appearance, but which proceed, in fact, from a heart too affectionate,

too ardent, which, for want of similar dispositions, is constrained to

content itself with nonentities, and be satisfied with fiction. It

is sufficient, at present, to have traced the origin of a propensity

which has modified my passions, set bounds to each, and by giving

too much ardor to my wishes, has ever rendered me too indolent to

obtain them.

  Thus I attained my sixteenth year, uneasy, discontented with

myself and everything that surrounded me; displeased with my

occupation, without enjoying the pleasures common to my age, weeping

without a cause, sighing I knew not why, and fond of my chimerical

ideas for want of more valuable realities.

  Every Sunday, after sermon-time, my companions came to fetch me out,

wishing me to partake of their diversions. I would willingly have been

excused, but when once engaged in amusement, I was more animated and

enterprising than any of them; it was equally difficult to engage or

restrain me: indeed, this was ever a leading trait in my character. In

our country walks I was ever foremost, and never thought of

returning till reminded by some of my companions. I was twice

obliged to be from my master's the whole night, the city gates

having been shut before I could reach them. The reader may imagine

what treatment this procured me the following mornings; but I was

promised such a reception for the third, that I made a firm resolution

never to expose myself to the danger of it. Notwithstanding my

determination, I repeated this dreaded transgression, my vigilance

having been rendered useless by a cursed captain, named M. Minutoli,

who, when on guard, always shut the gate he had charge of an hour

before the usual time. I was returning home with my two companions,

and had got within half a league of the city, when I heard them beat

the tattoo; I redouble my pace, I run with my utmost speed, I approach

the bridge, see the soldiers already at their posts I call out to them

in a suffocated voice- it is too late; I am twenty paces from the

guard, the first bridge is already drawn up, and I tremble to see

those terrible horns advanced in the air which announce the fatal

and inevitable destiny, which from this moment began to pursue me.

  I threw myself on the glacis in a transport of despair, while my

companions, who only laughed at the accident, immediately determined

what to do. My resolution, though different from theirs, was equally

sudden: on the spot, I swore never to return to my master's, and the

next morning, when my companions entered the city, I bade them an

eternal adieu, conjuring them at the same time to inform my cousin

Bernard of my resolution, and the place where he might see me for

the last time.

  From the commencement of my apprenticeship I had seldom seen him; at

first, indeed, we saw each other on Sundays, but each acquiring

different habits, our meetings were less frequent. I am persuaded

his mother contributed greatly towards this change; he was to consider

himself as a person of consequence, I was a pitiful apprentice;

notwithstanding our relationship, equality no longer subsisted between

us, and it was degrading himself to frequent my company. As he had a

natural good heart his mother's lessons did not take an immediate

effect, and for some time he continued to visit me.

  Having learned my resolution, he hastened to the spot I had

appointed, not, however, to dissuade me from it, but to render my

flight agreeable, by some trifling presents, as my own resources would

not have carried me far. He gave me, among other things, a small

sword, which I was very proud of, and took with me as far as Turin,

where absolute want constrained me to dispose of it. The more I

reflect on his behavior at this critical moment, the more I am

persuaded he followed the instructions of his mother, and perhaps

his father likewise; for, had he been left to his own feelings, he

would have endeavored to retain, or have been tempted to accompany me;

on the contrary, he encouraged the design, and when he saw me

resolutely determined to pursue it, without seeming much affected,

left me to my fate. We never saw or wrote to each other from that

time: I cannot but regret this loss, for his heart was essentially

good, and we seemed formed for a more lasting friendship.

  Before I abandon myself to the fatality of my destiny, let me

contemplate for a moment the prospect that awaited me had I fallen

into the hands of a better master. Nothing could have been more

agreeable to my disposition, or more likely to confer happiness,

than the peaceful condition of a good artificer, in so respectable a

line as engravers are considered at Geneva. I could have obtained an

easy subsistence, if not a fortune; this would have bounded my

ambition; I should have had means to indulge in moderate pleasures,

and should have continued in my natural sphere, without meeting with

any temptation to go beyond it. Having an imagination sufficiently

fertile to embellish with its chimeras every situation, and powerful

enough to transport me from one to another, it was immaterial in which

I was fixed; that was best adapted to me, which, requiring the least

care or exertion, left the mind most at liberty; and this happiness

I should have enjoyed. In my native country, in the bosom of my

religion, family, and friends, I should have passed a calm and

peaceful life in the uniformity of a pleasing occupation, and among

connections dear to my heart. I should have been a good Christian, a

good citizen, a good friend, a good man. I should have relished my

condition, perhaps have been an honor to it, and after having passed a

life of happy obscurity, surrounded by my family, I should have died

at peace. Soon it may be forgotten, but while remembered it would have

been with tenderness and regret.

  Instead of this- what a picture am I about to draw!- Alas! why

should I anticipate the miseries I have endured? The reader will

have but too much of the melancholy subject.
