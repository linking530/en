THE ARGUMENT.

With grave procession, songs and psalms devout

Heaven's sacred aid the Christian lords invoke;

That done, they scale the wall which kept them out:

The fort is almost won, the gates nigh broke:

Godfrey is wounded by Clorinda stout,

And lost is that day's conquest by the stroke;

The angel cures him, he returns to fight,

But lost his labor, for day lost his light.





I

The Christian army's great and puissant guide,

To assault the town that all his thoughts had bent,

Did ladders, rams, and engines huge provide,

When reverend Peter to him gravely went,

And drawing him with sober grace aside,

With words severe thus told his high intent;

"Right well, my lord, these earthly strengths you move,

But let us first begin from Heaven above:



II

"With public prayer, zeal and faith devout,

The aid, assistance, and the help obtain

Of all the blessed of the heavenly rout,

With whose support you conquest sure may gain;

First let the priests before thine armies stout

With sacred hymns their holy voices strain.

And thou and all thy lords and peers with thee,

Of godliness and faith examples be."



III

Thus spake the hermit grave in words severe:

Godfrey allowed his counsel, sage, and wise,

"Of Christ the Lord," quoth he, "thou servant dear,

I yield to follow thy divine advice,

And while the princes I assemble here,

The great procession, songs and sacrifice,

With Bishop William, thou and Ademare,

With sacred and with solemn pomp prepare."



IV

Next morn the bishops twain, the heremite,

And all the clerks and priests of less estate,

Did in the middest of the camp unite

Within a place for prayer consecrate,

Each priest adorned was in a surplice white,

The bishops donned their albes and copes of state,

Above their rochets buttoned fair before,

And mitres on their heads like crowns they wore.



V

Peter alone, before, spread to the wind

The glorious sign of our salvation great,

With easy pace the choir come all behind,

And hymns and psalms in order true repeat,

With sweet respondence in harmonious kind

Their humble song the yielding air doth beat,

"Lastly, together went the reverend pair

Of prelates sage, William and Ademare,



VI

The mighty duke came next, as princes do,

Without companion, marching all alone,

The lords and captains then came two and two,

With easy pace thus ordered, passing through

The trench and rampire, to the fields they gone,

No thundering drum, no trumpet shrill they hear,

Their godly music psalms and prayers were.



VII

To thee, O Father, Son, and sacred Sprite,

One true, eternal, everlasting King;

To Christ's dear mother, Mary, vlrgin bright,

Psalms of thanksgiving and of praise they sing;

To them that angels down from heaven to fight

Gainst the blasphemous beast and dragon bring;

To him also that of our Saviour good,

Washed the sacred font in Jordan's flood.



VIII

Him likewise they invoke, called the Rock

Whereon the Lord, they say, his Church did rear,

Whose true successors close or else unlock

The blessed gates of grace and mercy dear;

And all the elected twelve the chosen flock,

Of his triumphant death who witness bear;

And them by torment, slaughter, fire and sword

Who martyrs died to confirm his word;



IX

And them also whose books and writings tell

What certain path to heavenly bliss us leads;

And hermits good, and ancresses that dwell

Mewed up in walls, and mumble on their beads,

And virgin nuns in close and private cell,

Where, but shrift fathers, never mankind treads:

On these they called, and on all the rout

Of angels, martyrs, and of saints devout.



X

Singing and saying thus, the camp devout

Spread forth her zealous squadrons broad and wide';

Toward mount Olivet went all this route,

So called of olive trees the hills which hide,

A mountain known by fame the world throughout,

Which riseth on the city's eastern side,

From it divided by the valley green

Of Josaphat, that fills the space between.



XI

Hither the armies went, and chanted shrill,

That all the deep and hollow dales resound;

From hollow mounts and caves in every hill,

A thousand echoes also sung around,

It seemed some clever, that sung with art and skill,

Dwelt in those savage dens and shady ground,

For oft resounds from the banks they hear,

The name of Christ and of his mother dear.



XII

Upon the walls the Pagans old and young

Stood hushed and still, amated and amazed,

At their grave order and their humble song,

At their strange pomp and customs new they gazed:

But when the show they had beholden long,

An hideous yell the wicked miscreants raised,

That with vile blasphemies the mountain hoar,

The woods, the waters, and the valleys roar.



XIII

But yet with sacred notes the hosts proceed,

Though blasphemies they hear and cursed things;

So with Apollo's harp Pan tunes his reed,

So adders hiss where Philomela sings;

Nor flying darts nor stones the Christians dreed,

Nor arrows shot, nor quarries cast from slings;

But with assured faith, as dreading naught,

The holy work begun to end they brought.



XIV

A table set they on the mountain's height

To minister thereon the sacrament,

In golden candlesticks a hallowed light

At either end of virgin wax there brent;

In costly vestments sacred William dight,

With fear and trembling to the altar went,

And prayer there and service loud begins,

Both for his own and all the army's sins.



XV

Humbly they heard his words that stood him nigh,

The rest far off upon him bent their eyes,

But when he ended had the service high,

"You servants of the Lord depart," he cries:

His hands he lifted then up to the sky,

And blessed all those warlike companies;

And they dismissed returned the way they came,

Their order as before, their pomp the same.



XVI

Within their camp arrived, this voyage ended,

Toward his tent the duke himself withdrew,

Upon their guide by heaps the bands attended,

Till his pavilion's stately door they view,

There to the Lord his welfare they commended,

And with him left the worthies of the crew,

Whom at a costly and rich feast he placed,

And with the highest room old Raymond graced.



XVII

Now when the hungry knights sufficed are

With meat, with drink, with spices of the best,

Quoth he, "When next you see the morning star,

To assault the town be ready all and prest:

To-morrow is a day of pains and war,

This of repose, of quiet, peace, and rest;

Go, take your ease this evening, and this night,

And make you strong against to-morrow's fight."

XVIII

They took their leave, and Godfrey's heralds rode

To intimate his will on every side,

And published it through all the lodgings broad,

That gainst the morn each should himself provide;

Meanwhile they might their hearts of cares unload,

And rest their tired limbs that eveningtide;

Thus fared they till night their eyes did close,

Night friend to gentle rest and sweet repose.



XIX

With little sign as yet of springing day

Out peeped, not well appeared the rising morn,

The plough yet tore not up the fertile lay,

Nor to their feed the sheep from folds return,

The birds sate silent on the greenwood spray

Amid the groves unheard was hound and horn,

When trumpets shrill, true signs of hardy fights,

Called up to arms the soldiers, called the knights:

XX

"Arm, arm at once!" an hundred squadrons cried,

And with their cry to arm them all begin.

Godfrey arose, that day he laid aside

His hauberk strong he wonts to combat in,

And donned a breastplate fair, of proof untried,

Such one as footmen use, light, easy, thin.

Scantly the warlord thus clothed had his gromes,

When aged Raymond to his presence comes.



XXI

And furnished to us when he the man beheld,

By his attire his secret thought he guessed,

"Where is," quoth he, "your sure and trusty shield?

Your helm, your hauberk strong?  where all the rest?

Why be you half disarmed?  why to the field

Approach you in these weak defences dressed?

I see this day you mean a course to run,

Wherein may peril much, small praise be won.



XXII

"Alas, do you that idle prise expect,

To set first foot this conquered wall above?

Of less account some knight thereto object

Whose loss so great and harmful cannot prove;

My lord, your life with greater care protect,

And love yourself because all us you love,

Your happy life is spirit, soul, and breath

Of all this camp, preserve it then from death."



XXIII

To this he answered thus, "You know," he said,

"In Clarimont by mighty Urban's hand

When I was girded with this noble blade,

For Christ's true faith to fight in every land,

To God even then a secret vow I made,

Not as a captain here this day to stand

And give directions, but with shield and sword

To fight, to win, or die for Christ my Lord.



XXIV

"When all this camp in battle strong shall be

Ordained and ordered, well disposed all,

And all things done which to the high degree

And sacred place I hold belongen shall;

Then reason is it, nor dissuade thou me,

That I likewise assault this sacred wall,

Lest from my vow to God late made I swerve:

He shall this life defend, keep and preserve."



XXV

Thus he concludes, and every hardy knight

His sample followed, and his brethren twain,

The other princes put on harness light,

As footmen use: but all the Pagan train

Toward that side bent their defensive might

Which lies exposed to view of Charles's wain

And Zephyrus' sweet blasts, for on that part

The town was weakest, both by side and art.



XXVI

On all parts else the fort was strong by site,

With mighty hills defenced from foreign rage,

And to this part the tyrant gan unite

His subjects born and bands that serve for wage,

From this exploit he spared nor great nor lite,

The aged men, and boys of tender age,

To fire of angry war still brought new fuel,

Stones, darts, lime, brimstone and bitumen cruel.



XXVII

All full of arms and weapons was the wall,

Under whose basis that fair plain doth run,

There stood the Soldan like a giant tall,

So stood at Rhodes the Coloss of the sun,

Waist high, Argantes showed himself withal,

At whose stern looks the French to quake begun,

Clorinda on the corner tower alone,

In silver arms like rising Cynthia shone.



XXVIII

Her rattling quiver at her shoulders hung,

Therein a flash of arrows feathered weel.

In her left hand her bow was bended strong,

Therein a shaft headed with mortal steel,

So fit to shoot she singled forth among

Her foes who first her quarries' strength should feel,

So fit to shoot Latona's daughter stood

When Niobe she killed and all her brood.



XXIX

The aged tyrant tottered on his feet

From gate to gate, from wall to wall he flew,

He comforts all his bands with speeches sweet,

And every fort and bastion doth review,

For every need prepared in every street

New regiments he placed and weapons new.

The matrons grave within their temples high

To idols false for succors call and cry,



XXX

"O Macon, break in twain the steeled lance

On wicked Godfrey with thy righteous hands,

Against thy name he doth his arm advance,

His rebel blood pour out upon these sands;"

These cries within his ears no enterance

Could find, for naught he hears, naught understands.

While thus the town for her defence ordains,

His armies Godfrey ordereth on the plains;



XXXI

His forces first on foot he forward brought,

With goodly order, providence and art,

And gainst these towers which to assail he thought,

In battles twain his strength he doth depart,

Between them crossbows stood, and engines wrought

To cast a stone, a quarry, or a dart,

From whence like thunder's dint or lightnings new

Against the bulwark stones and lances flew.



XXXII

His men at arms did back his bands on foot,

The light horse ride far off and serve for wings,

He gave the sign, so mighty was the rout

Of those that shot with bows and cast with slings,

Such storms of shafts and stones flew all about,

That many a Pagan proud to death it brings,

Some died, some at their loops durst scant outpeep,

Some fled and left the place they took to keep.

XXXIII

The hardy Frenchmen, full of heat and haste,

Ran boldly forward to the ditches large,

And o'er their heads an iron pentice vast

They built, by joining many a shield and targe,

Some with their engines ceaseless shot and cast,

And volleys huge of arrows sharp discharge,

Upon the ditches some employed their pain

To fill the moat and even it with the plain.



XXXIV

With slime or mud the ditches were not soft,

But dry and sandy, void of waters clear,

Though large and deep the Christians fill them oft,

With rubbish, fagots, stones, and trees they bear:

Adrastus first advanced his crest aloft,

And boldly gan a strong scalado rear,

And through the falling storm did upward climb

Of stones, darts, arrows, fire, pitch and lime:

XXXV

The hardy Switzer now so far was gone

That half way up with mickle pain he got,

A thousand weapons he sustained alone,

And his audacious climbing ceased not;

At last upon him fell a mighty stone,

As from some engine great it had been shot,

It broke his helm, he tumbled from the height,

The strong Circassian cast that wondrous weight;



XXXVI

Not mortal was the blow, yet with the fall

On earth sore bruised the man lay in a swoon.

Argantes gan with boasting words to call,

"Who cometh next?  this first is tumbled down,

Come, hardy soldiers, come, assault this wall,

I will not shrink, nor fly, nor hide my crown,

If in your trench yourselves for dread you hold,

There shall you die like sheep killed in their fold."



XXXVII

Thus boasted he; but in their trenches deep,

The hidden squadrons kept themselves from scath,

The curtain made of shields did well off keep

Both darts and shot, and scorned all their wrath.

But now the ram upon the rampiers steep,

On mighty beams his head advanced hath,

With dreadful horns of iron tough tree great,

The walls and bulwarks trembled at his threat.



XXXVIII

An hundred able men meanwhile let fall

The weights behind, the engine tumbled down

And battered flat the battlements and wall:

So fell Taigetus hill on Sparta town,

It crushed the steeled shield in pieces small,

And beat the helmet to the wearers' crown,

And on the ruins of the walls and stones,

Dispersed left their blood their brains and bones.



XXXIX

The fierce assailants kept no longer close

Undcr the shelter of their target fine,

But their bold fronts to chance of war expose,

And gainst those towers let their virtue shine,

The scaling ladders up to skies arose,

The ground-works deep some closely undermine,

The walls before the Frenchmen shrink and shake,

And gaping sign of headlong falling make:



XL

And fallen they had, so far the strength extends

Of that fierce ram and his redoubted stroke,

But that the Pagan's care the place defends

And saved by warlike skill the wall nigh broke:

For to what part soe'er the engine bends,

Their sacks of wool they place the blow to choke,

Whose yielding breaks the strokes thereon which light,

So weakness oft subdues the greatest might.



XLI

While thus the worthies of the western crew

Maintained their brave assault and skirmish hot,

Her mighty bow Clorinda often drew,

And many a sharp and deadly arrow shot;

And from her bow no steeled shaft there flew

But that some blood the cursed engine got,

Blood of some valiant knight or man of fame,

For that proud shootress scorned weaker game.



XLII

The first she hit among the Christian peers

Was the bold son of England's noble king,

Above the trench himself he scantly rears,

But she an arrow loosed from the string,

The wicked steel his gauntlet breaks and tears,

And through his right hand thrust the piercing sting;

Disabled thus from fight, he gan retire,

Groaning for pain, but fretting more for ire.



XLIII

Lord Stephen of Amboise on the ditch's brim,

And on a ladder high, Clotharius died,

From back to breast an arrow pierced him,

The other was shot through from side to side:

Then as he managed brave his courser trim,

On his left arm he hit the Flemings' guide,

He stopped, and from the wound the reed out-twined,

But left the iron in his flesh behind.



XLIV

As Ademare stood to behold the fight

High on the bank, withdrawn to breathe a space,

A fatal shaft upon his forehead light,

His hand he lifted up to feel the place,

Whereon a second arrow chanced right,

And nailed his hand unto his wounded face,

He fell, and with his blood distained the land,

His holy blood shed by a virgin's hand.



XLV

While Palamede stood near the battlement,

Despising perils all, and all mishap,

And upward still his hardy footings bent,

On his right eye he caught a deadly clap,

Through his right eye Clorinda's seventh shaft went,

And in his neck broke forth a bloody gap;

He underneath that bulwark dying fell,

Which late to scale and win he trusted well.



XLVI

Thus shot the maid: the duke with hard assay

And sharp assault, meanwhile the town oppressed,

Against that part which to his campward lay

An engine huge and wondrous he addressed,

A tower of wood built for the town's decay

As high as were the walls and bulwarks best,

A turret full of men and weapons pent,

And yet on wheels it rolled, moved, and went.



XLVII

This rolling fort his nigh approaches made,

And darts and arrows spit against his foes,

As ships are wont in fight, so it assayed

With the strong wall to grapple and to close,

The Pagans on each side the piece invade,

And all their force against this mass oppose,

Sometimes the wheels, sometimes the battlement

With timber, logs and stones, they broke and rent,

XLVIII

So thick flew stones and darts, that no man sees

The azure heavens, the sun his brightness lost,

The clouds of weapons, like to swarms of bees,

Move the air, and there each other crossed:

And look how falling leaves drop down from trees,

When the moist sap is nipped with timely frost,

Or apples in strong winds from branches fall;

The Saracens so tumbled from the wall.



XLIX

For on their part the greatest slaughter light,

They had no shelter gainst so sharp a shower,

Some left on live betook themselves to flight,

So feared they this deadly thundering tower:

But Solyman stayed like a valiant knight,

And some with him, that trusted in his power,

Argantes with a long beech tree in hand,

Ran thither, this huge engine to withstand:



L

With this he pushed the tower, and back it drives

The length of all his tree, a wondrous way,

The hardy virgin by his side arrives,

To help Argantes in this hard assay:

The band that used the ram, this season strives

To cut the cords, wherein the woolpacks lay,

Which done, the sacks down in the trenches fall,

And to the battery naked left the wall.



LI

The tower above, the ram beneath doth thunder,

What lime and stone such puissance could abide?

The wall began, new bruised and crushed asunder,

Her wounded lap to open broad and wide,

Godfrey himself and his brought safely under

The shattered wall, where greatest breach he spied,

Himself he saves behind his mighty targe,

A shield not used but in some desperate charge.



LII

From hence he sees where Solyman descends,

Down to the threshold of the gaping breach,

And there it seems the mighty prince intends

Godfredo's hoped entrance to impeach:

Argantes, and with him the maid, defends

The walls above, to which the tower doth reach,

His noble heart, when Godfrey this beheld,

With courage new with wrath and valor swelled.



LIII

He turned about and to good Sigiere spake,

Who bare his greatest shield and mighty bow,

"That sure and trusty target let me take,

Impenetrable is that shield I know,

Over these ruins will I passage make,

And enter first, the way is eath and low,

And time requires that by some noble feat

I should make known my strength and puissance great."



LIV

He scant had spoken, scant received the charge,

When on his leg a sudden shaft him hit,

And through that part a hole made wide and large,

Where his strong sinews fastened were and knit.

Clorinda, thou this arrow didst discharge,

And let the Pagans bless thy hand for it,

For by that shot thou savedst them that day

From bondage vile, from death and sure decay.



LV

The wounded duke, as though he felt no pain,

Still forward went, and mounted up the breach

His high attempt at first he nould refrain,

And after called his lords with cheerful speech;

But when his leg could not his weight sustain,

He saw his will did far his power outreach,

And more he strove his grief increased the more,

The bold assault he left at length therefore:



LVI

And with his hand he beckoned Guelpho near,

And said, "I must withdraw me to my tent,

My place and person in mine absence bear,

Supply my want, let not the fight relent,

I go, and will ere long again be here;

I go and straight return: "this said, he went,

On a light steed he leaped, and o'er the green

He rode, but rode not, as he thought, unseen.



LVII

When Godfrey parted, parted eke the heart, .

The strength and fortune of the Christian bands,.

Courage increased in their adverse part,

Wrath in their hearts, and vigor in their hands:

Valor, success, strength, hardiness and art,

Failed in the princes of the western lands,

Their swords were blunt, faint was their trumpet's blast,

Their sun was set, or else with clouds o'ercast.



LVIII

Upon the bulwarks now appeared bold

That fearful band that late for dread was fled!

The women that Clorinda's strength behold,

Their country's love to war encouraged,

They weapons got, and fight like men they would,

Their gowns tucked up, their locks were loose and spread,

Sharp darts they cast, and without dread or fear,

Exposed their breasts to save their fortress dear.

LIX

But that which most dismayed the Christian knights,

And added courage to the Pagans most,

Was Guelpho's sudden fall in all men's sights,

Who tumbled headlong down, his footing lost,

A mighty stone upon the worthy lights,

But whence it came none wist, nor from what coast;

And with like blow, which more their hearts dismayed,

Beside him low in dust old Raymond laid:



LX

And Eustace eke within the ditches large,

To narrow shifts and last extremes they drive,

Upon their foes so fierce the Pagans charge,

And with good-fortune so their blows they give,

That whom they hit, in spite of helm or targe,

They deeply wound, or else of life deprive.

At this their good success Argantes proud,

Waxing more fell, thus roared and cried aloud:



LXI

"This is not Antioch, nor the evening dark

Can help your privy sleights with friendly shade,

The sun yet shines, your falsehood can we mark,

In other wise this bold assault is made;

Of praise and glory quenched is the spark

That made you first these eastern lands invade,

Why cease you now?  why take you not this fort?

What!  are you weary for a charge so short?"



LXII

Thus raged he, and in such hellish sort

Increased the fury in the brain-sick knight,

That he esteemed that large and ample fort

Too strait a field, wherein to prove his might,

There where the breach had framed a new-made port,

Himself he placed, with nimble skips and light,

He cleared the passage out, and thus he cried

To Solyman, that fought close by his side:



LXIII

"Come, Solyman, the time and place behold,

That of our valors well may judge the doubt,

What sayest thou?  amongst these Christians bold,

First leap he forth that holds himself most stout:"

While thus his will the mighty champion told,

Both Solyman and he at once leaped out,

Fury the first provoked, disdain the last,

Who scorned the challenge ere his lips it passed.



LXIV

Upon their foes unlooked-for they flew,

Each spited other for his virtue's sake,

So many soldiers this fierce couple slew,

So many shields they cleft and helms they break,

So many ladders to the earth they threw,

That well they seemed a mount thereof to make,

Or else some vamure fit to save the town,

Instead of that the Christians late beat down.



LXV

The folk that strove with rage and haste before

Who first the wall and rampire should ascend,

Retire, and for that honor strive no more,

Scantly they could their limbs and lives defend,

They fled, their engines lost the Pagans tore

In pieces small, their rams to naught they rend,

And all unfit for further service make

With so great force and rage their beams they brake.



LXVI

The Pagans ran transported with their ire,

Now here, now there, and woful slaughters wrought,

At last they called for devouring fire,

Two burning pines against the tower they brought,

So from the palace of their hellish sire,

When all this world they would consume to naught,

The fury sisters come with fire in hands,

Shaking their snaky locks and sparkling brands:



LXVII

But noble Tancred, who this while applied

Grave exhortations to his bold Latines,

When of these knights the wondrous acts he spied,

And saw the champions with their burning pines,

He left his talk, and thither forthwith hied,

To stop the rage of those fell Saracines.

And with such force the fight he there renewed,

That now they fled and lost who late pursued.



LXVIII

Thus changed the state and fortune of the fray,

Meanwhile the wounded duke, in grief and teen,

Within his great pavilion rich and gay,

Good Sigiere and Baldwin stood between;

His other friends whom his mishap dismay,

With grief and tears about assembled been:

He strove in haste the weapon out to wind,

And broke the reed, but left the head behind.



LXIX

He bade them take the speediest way they might,

Of that unlucky hurt to make him sound,

And to lay ope the depth thereof to sight,

He willed them open, search and lance the wound,

"Send me again," quoth he, "to end this fight,

Before the sun be sunken under ground;"

And leaning on a broken spear, he thrust

His leg straight out, to him that cure it must.



LXX

Erotimus, born on the banks of Po,

Was he that undertook to cure the knight,

All what green herbs or waters pure could do,

He knew their power, their virtue, and their might,

A noble poet was the man also,

But in this science had a more delight,

He could restore to health death-wounded men,

And make their names immortal with his pen.



LXXI

The mighty duke yet never changed cheer,

But grieved to see his friends lamenting stand;

The leech prepared his cloths and cleansing gear,

And with a belt his gown about him band,

Now with his herbs the steely head to tear

Out of the flesh he proved, now with his hand,

Now with his hand, now with his instrument

He shaked and plucked it, yet not forth it went.



LXXII

His labor vain, his art prevailed naught,

His luck was ill, although his skill were good,

To such extremes the wounded prince he brought,

That with fell pain he swooned as he stood:

But the angel pure, that kept him, went and sought

Divine dictamnum, out of Ida wood,

This herb is rough, and bears a purple flower,

And in his budding leaves lies all his power.



LXXIII

Kind nature first upon the craggy clift

Bewrayed this herb unto the mountain goat,

That when her sides a cruel shaft hath rift,

With it she shakes the reed out of her coat;

This in a moment fetched the angel swift,

And brought from Ida hill, though far remote,

The juice whereof in a prepared bath

Unseen the blessed spirit poured hath.



LXXIV

Pure nectar from that spring of Lydia than,

And panaces divine therein he threw,

The cunning leech to bathe the wound began,

And of itself the steely head outflew;

The bleeding stanched, no vermile drop outran,

The leg again waxed strong with vigor new:

Erotimus cried out, "This hurt and wound

No human art or hand so soon makes sound:



LXXV

"Some angel good I think come down from skies

Thy surgeon is, for here plain tokens are

Of grace divine which to thy help applies,

Thy weapon take and haste again to war."

In precious cloths his leg the chieftain ties,

Naught could the man from blood and fight debar;

A sturdy lance in his right hand he braced,

His shield he took, and on his helmet laced:

LXXVI

And with a thousand knights and barons bold,

Toward the town he hasted from his camp,

In clouds of dust was Titan's face enrolled,

Trembled the earth whereon the worthies stamp,

His foes far off his dreadful looks behold,

Which in their hearts of courage quenched the lamp,

A chilling fear ran cold through every vein,

Lord Godfrey shouted thrice and all his train:



LXXVII

Their sovereign's voice his hardy people knew,

And his loud cries that cheered each fearful heart;

Thereat new strength they took and courage new,

And to the fierce assault again they start.

The Pagans twain this while themselves withdrew

Within the breach to save that battered part,

And with great loss a skirmish hot they hold

Against Tancredi and his squadron bold.

LXXVIII

Thither came Godfrey armed round about

In trusty plate, with fierce and dreadful look;

At first approach against Argantes stout

Headed with poignant steel a lance he shook,

No casting engine with such force throws out

A knotty spear, and as the way it took,

It whistled in the air, the fearless knight

Opposed his shield against that weapon's might.



LXXIX

The dreadful blow quite through his target drove,

And bored through his breastplate strong and thick,

The tender skin it in his bosom rove,

The purple-blood out-streamed from the quick;

To wrest it out the wounded Pagan strove

And little leisure gave it there to stick;

At Godfrey's head the lance again he cast,

And said, "Lo, there again thy dart thou hast."



LXXX

The spear flew back the way it lately came,

And would revenge the harm itself had done,

But missed the mark whereat the man did aim,

He stepped aside the furious blow to shun:

But Sigiere in his throat received the same,

The murdering weapon at his neck out-run,

Nor aught it grieved the man to lose his breath,

Since in his prince's stead he suffered death.



LXXXI

Even then the Soldan struck with monstrous main

The noble leader of the Norman band,

He reeled awhile and staggered with the pain,

And wheeling round fell grovelling on the sand:

Godfrey no longer could the grief sustain

Of these displeasures, but with flaming brand,

Up to the breach in heat and haste he goes,

And hand to hand there combats with his foes;



LXXXII

And there great wonders surely wrought he had,

Mortal the fight, and fierce had been the fray,

But that dark night, from her pavilion sad,

Her cloudy wings did on the earth display,

Her quiet shades she interposed glad

To cause the knights their arms aside to lay;

Godfrey withdrew, and to their tents they wend,

And thus this bloody day was brought to end.



LXXXIII

The weak and wounded ere he left the field,

The godly duke to safety thence conveyed,

Nor to his foes his engines would he yield,

In them his hope to win the fortress laid;

Then to the tower he went, and it beheeld,

The tower that late the Pagan lords dismayed

But now stood bruised, broken, cracked and shivered,

From some sharp storm as it were late delivered.



LXXXIV

From dangers great escaped, but late it was,

And now to safety brought well-nigh it seems,

But as a ship that under sail doth pass

The roaring billows and the raging streams,

And drawing nigh the wished port, alas,

Breaks on some hidden rocks her ribs and beams;

Or as a steed rough ways that well hath passed,

Before his inn stumbleth and falls at last:



LXXXV

Such hap befell that tower, for on that side

Gainst which the Pagans' force and battery bend,

Two wheels were broke whereon the piece should ride,

The maimed engine could no further wend,

The troop that guarded it that part provide

To underprop with posts, and it defend

Till carpenters and cunning workmen came

Whose skill should help and rear again the same.



LXXXVI

Thus Godfrey bids, and that ere springing-day,

The cracks and bruises all amend they should,

Each open passage, and each privy way

About the piece, he kept with soldiers bold:

But the loud rumor, both of that they say,

And that they do, is heard within the hold,

A thousand lights about the tower they view,

And what they wrought all night both saw and knew.
