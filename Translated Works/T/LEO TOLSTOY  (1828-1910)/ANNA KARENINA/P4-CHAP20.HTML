Chapter 20</H2>
Alexei Alexandrovich took leave of Betsy in the drawing room, and went
to his wife. She was lying down, but hearing his steps she sat up hastily
in her former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him. He saw she had
been crying.

<P>&nbsp;`I am very grateful for your confidence in me.' He repeated gently
in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy's presence in French, and sat
down beside her. When he spoke to her in Russian, using the Russian `thou'
of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably irritating to Anna. `And
I am very grateful for your decision. I, too, imagine that since he is
going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here.
However, if...'

<P>&nbsp;`But I've said so already, so why repeat it?' Anna suddenly interrupted
him, with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing. `No sort of
necessity,' she thought, `for a man to come and say good-by to the woman
he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined himself,
and who cannot live without him. No sort of necessity!' She compressed
her lips, and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen
veins. They were slowly rubbing each other. `Let us never speak of it,'
she added more calmly.

<P>&nbsp;`I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad
to see...' Alexei Alexandrovich was beginning.

<P>&nbsp;`That my wish coincides with your own,' she finished quickly,
exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would
say.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes,' he assented; `and Princess Tverskaia's interference in
the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for. She especially...'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't believe a word of what's said about her,' said Anna quickly.
`I know she really cares for me.'

<P>&nbsp;Alexei Alexandrovich sighed and said nothing. She played nervously
with the tassel of her dressing gown, glancing at him with that torturing
sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself, though she
could not control it. Her only desire now was to be rid of his repelling
presence.

<P>&nbsp;`I have just sent for the doctor,' said Alexei Alexandrovich.

<P>&nbsp;`I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?'

<P>&nbsp;`No - the little one cries, and they say the wet nurse hasn't
enough milk.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why didn't you let me nurse her, when I begged to? Anyway' (Alexei
Alexandrovich knew what was meant by that `anyway'), `she's a baby, and
they're killing her.' She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought
her. `I begged to nurse her, I wasn't allowed to, and now I'm blamed for
it.'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't blame...'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, you do blame me! My God! Why didn't I die!' And she broke
into sobs. `Forgive me, I'm nervous, I'm unjust,' she said, controlling
herself, `but do go away...'

<P>&nbsp;`No, it can't go on like this,' Alexei Alexandrovich said to himself
resolutely as he left his wife's room.

<P>&nbsp;Never had the impossibility of his position in the world's eyes,
and his wife's hatred of him, and, above all, the might of that mysterious
brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations and
exacted conformity with its decrees and a change in his present attitude
to his wife - never had it been presented to him with such distinctness
as on that day. He saw clearly that all the world and Anna expected something
of him, but what exactly he could not make out. He felt that this was rousing
in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind, and of
all the good of his achievement. He believed that for Anna herself it would
be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they all thought
this out of the question, he was even ready to allow these relations to
be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced, and he was not
deprived of them nor forced to change his position. Bad as this might be,
it was at any rate better than a rupture, which would put her in a hopeless
and shameful position, and deprive him of everything he cared for. But
he felt helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone was against him, and
that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and
right, but would be forced to do what was wrong, though to them it seemed
the proper thing.
