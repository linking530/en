Chapter 31</H2>
It was a foul day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids,
with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.

<P>&nbsp;Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel,
smart and jaunty in his European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort.
They were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, who
was walking on the other side. Varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat
with a turndown brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade
with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she met Kitty, they exchanged
friendly glances.

<P>&nbsp;`Mamma, couldn't I speak to her?' said Kitty, watching her unknown
friend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and that they
might come there together.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, if you want to so much, I'll find out about her first and
make her acquaintance myself,' answered her mother. `What do you see in
her out of the way? A companion, most probably. If you like, I'll make
acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her belle-soeur,' added
the Princess, lifting her head haughtily.

<P>&nbsp;Kitty knew that the Princess was offended because Madame Stahl
had apparently avoided making her acquaintance. Kitty did not insist.

<P>&nbsp;`How wonderfully sweet she is!' she said, gazing at Varenka just
as she handed a glass to the Frenchwoman. `Look how natural and sweet it
all is.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's so funny to see your engouements,' said the Princess. `No,
we'd better go back,' she added, noticing Levin coming toward them with
his companion and a German doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily
and angrily.

<P>&nbsp;They turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not merely noisy
talk, but actual shouting. Levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor,
and the doctor, too, was excited. A crowd gathered about them. The Princess
and Kitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find
out what was up.

<P>&nbsp;A few minutes later the colonel overtook them.

<P>&nbsp;`What was it?' inquired the Princess.

<P>&nbsp;`Scandalous and disgraceful!' answered the colonel. `The one thing
to be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad. That tall gentleman was abusing
the doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn't treating
him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him. It's simply
scandalous!'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, how unpleasant!' said the Princess. `Well, and how did it
end?'

<P>&nbsp;`Luckily at that point that miss... the one in the mushroom hat...
intervened. She is a Russian lady, I think,' said the colonel.

<P>&nbsp;`Mademoiselle Varenka?' Kitty asked joyously.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, yes. She came to the rescue before anyone else; she took
the man by the arm and led him away.'

<P>&nbsp;`There, mamma,' said Kitty, `yet you wonder why I'm enthusiastic
about her.'

<P>&nbsp;The next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed
that Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and
his companion as with her other proteges. She went up to them, entered
into conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman, who
could not speak any foreign language.

<P>&nbsp;Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her
make acquaintance with Varenka. And, disagreeable as it was to the Princess
to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of Madame
Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries about Varenka,
and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to prove that there
could he no harm, even if little good in the acquaintance, she herself
approached Varenka and made acquaintance with her.

<P>&nbsp;Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while
Varenka had stopped outside the baker's, the Princess approached her.

<P>&nbsp;`Allow me to make your acquaintance,' she said, with her dignified
smile. `My daughter has lost her heart to you,' she said. `Possibly you
do not know me. I am...'

<P>&nbsp;`That feeling is more than reciprocal, Princess,' Varenka answered
hurriedly.

<P>&nbsp;`What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!' said
the Princess.

<P>&nbsp;Varenka flushed a little.

<P>&nbsp;`I don't remember. I don't think I did anything,' she said.

<P>&nbsp;`Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, sa compagne called me, and I tried to pacify him; he's very
ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor. I'm used to looking after such
invalids.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, I've heard you live at Mentone with your aunt - I think
- Madame Stahl: I used to know her belle-soeur.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, she's not my aunt. I call her maman, but I am not related
to her; I was brought up by her,' answered Varenka, flushing a little again.

<P>&nbsp;This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid
expression of her face, that the Princess saw why Kitty had taken such
a fancy to Varenka.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, and what's this Levin going to do?' asked the Princess.

<P>&nbsp;`He's going away,' answered Varenka.

<P>&nbsp;At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight
because her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.

<P>&nbsp;`See, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with Mademoiselle...'

<P>&nbsp;`Varenka,' Varenka put in smiling, `that's what everyone calls
me.'

<P>&nbsp;Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, squeezed
her new friend's hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay motionless
in her hand. The hand did not respond to her pressure, but the face of
Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though rather mournful,
smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.

<P>&nbsp;`I have long wished for this too,' she said.

<P>&nbsp;`But `But you are so busy...'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, no I'm not at all busy,' answered Varenka, but at that moment
she had to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls, children
of an invalid, ran up to her.

<P>&nbsp;`Varenka, mamma's calling!' they cried.

<P>&nbsp;And Varenka went after them.
