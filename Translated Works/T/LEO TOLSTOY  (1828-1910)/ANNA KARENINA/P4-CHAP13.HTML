Chapter 13</H2>
When they rose from the table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into
the drawing room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too obviously
paying her attention. He remained in the little ring of men, taking part
in the general conversation, and, without looking at Kitty, he was aware
of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was in the drawing
room.

<P>&nbsp;He did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise
he had made her - always to think well of all men, and to like everyone
always. The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov
saw a sort of special principle, called by him the choral principle. Levin
did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his brother, who had a special attitude
of his own, both admitting yet not admitting the significance of the Russian
commune. But he talked to them, simply trying to reconcile and soften their
differences. He was not in the least interested in what he said himself,
and even less so in what they said; all he wanted was that they and everyone
should be happy and contented. He knew now the one thing of importance;
and that one thing was at first there, in the drawing room, and then began
moving across, and came to a standstill at the door. Without turning round
he felt her eyes fixed on him, and her smile, and he could not help turning
round. She was standing in the doorway with Shcherbatsky, looking at Levin.

<P>&nbsp;`I thought you were going toward the piano,' said he, going up
to her. `That's something I miss in the country - music.'

<P>&nbsp;`No; we only came to fetch you, and I thank you,' she said, rewarding
him with a smile that was like a gift, `for coming. What do they want to
argue for? No one ever convinces anyone, you know.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes; that's true,' said Levin; `it generally happens that one
argues warmly simply because one can't make out what one's opponent wants
to prove.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent
people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of logical
subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at the realization
that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had
long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both, but that
they liked different things, and would not define what they liked for fear
of its being attacked. He had often had the experience of suddenly grasping
in a discussion what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too,
and immediately he found himself agreeing, and then all arguments fell
away as useless. Sometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, expressing
at last what he liked himself, which he was devising arguments to defend,
and, chancing to express it well and genuinely, he had found his opponent
at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position. He tried to say this.

<P>&nbsp;She knit her brow, trying to understand. But directly he began
to illustrate his meaning, she understood at once.

<P>&nbsp;`I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious
to him, then one can...'

<P>&nbsp;She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.
Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the confused,
verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic, clear,
almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.

<P>&nbsp;Shcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card
table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles
over the new green cloth.

<P>&nbsp;They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner
- the liberty and occupations of women. Levin was of the opinion of Darya
Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman's duties
in a family. He supported this view by the fact that no family can get
on without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are
and must be nurses, either relations or hired.

<P>&nbsp;`No,' said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more bravely
with her truthful eyes; `a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot
live in the family without humiliation, while she herself...'

<P>&nbsp;At the hint he understood her.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, yes,' he said. `Yes, yes, yes - you're right; you're right!'

<P>&nbsp;And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner about
the liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an
old maid's existence and its humiliation in Kitty's heart; and loving her,
he felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his arguments.

<P>&nbsp;A silence followed. She was still drawing with the chalk on the
table. Her eyes were shining with a soft light. Under the influence of
her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness.

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! I've scribbled all over the table!' she said, and, laying
down the chalk, she made a movement as though to get up.

<P>&nbsp;`What! Shall I be left alone - without her?' he thought with horror,
and he took the chalk. `Wait a minute,' he said, sitting down to the table.
`I've long wanted to ask you one thing.'

<P>&nbsp;He looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes.

<P>&nbsp;`Please, ask it.'

<P>&nbsp;`Here,' he said; and he wrote the initial letters, w, y, t, m:
i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t. These letters meant, `When you told me: it
could never be, did that mean never, or then?' There seemed no likelihood
that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he looked at her
as though his life depended on her understanding the words.

<P>&nbsp;She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on
her hands and began to read. Once or twice she stole a look at him, as
though asking him, `Is it what I think it is?'

<P>&nbsp;`I understand,' she said, flushing.

<P>&nbsp;`What is this word?' he said, pointing to the n that stood for
never.

<P>&nbsp;`It means never,' she said; `but that's not true!'

<P>&nbsp;He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk,
and stood up. She wrote, t, i, c, n, a, d.

<P>&nbsp;Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her
conversation with Alexei Alexandrovich when she caught sight of the two
figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile looking
upward at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing
eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her. He was suddenly
radiant: he had understood. It meant, `Then I could not answer differently.'

<P>&nbsp;He glanced at her questioningly, timidly.

<P>&nbsp;`Only then?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes,' her smile answered.

<P>&nbsp;`And n... And now?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, read this. I'll tell you what I should like - should like
so much!' She wrote the initial letters, i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h. This meant,
`If you could forget and forgive what happened.'

<P>&nbsp;He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking
it, wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, `I have nothing
to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.'

<P>&nbsp;She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.

<P>&nbsp;`I understand,' she said in a whisper.

<P>&nbsp;He sat down and wrote a long phrase. She understood it all, and
without asking him, `Is it this?' took the chalk and at once answered.

<P>&nbsp;For a long while he could not understand what she had written,
and often looked into her eyes. He was stupefied with happiness. He could
not supply the words she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with
happiness, he saw all he needed to know. And he wrote three letters. But
he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and herself
finished and wrote the answer, `Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;`You're playing secretaire?' said the old Prince. `But we must
really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.

<P>&nbsp;In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said
that she loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that
he would come tomorrow morning.
