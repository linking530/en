Chapter 23</H2>
Vronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as now, tried
to bring her to consider her position, and every time he had been confronted
by the same superficiality and frivolity with which she met his appeal
now. It was as though there were something in this which she could not
or would not face, as though directly she began to speak of this, she,
the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and another strange and
unaccountable woman came out, whom he did not love and whom he feared,
and who was in opposition to him. But today he was resolved to have it
out.

<P>&nbsp;`Whether he knows or not,' said Vronsky, in his usual calm and
firm tone, `whether he knows or not, has nothing to do with us. We cannot...
You cannot stay like this, especially now.'

<P>&nbsp;`What's to be done, according to you?' she asked with the same
frivolous irony. She who had so feared he would take her condition too
frivolously, was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity
of taking some step.

<P>&nbsp;`Tell him everything, and leave him.'

<P>&nbsp;`Very well, let us suppose I do that,' she said. `Do you know
what the result of that would be? I can tell you it all beforehand,' and
a wicked light gleamed in her eyes, that had been so tender a minute before.
```Eh, you love another man, and have entered into a criminal liaison with
him?'' (Mimicking her husband, she threw an emphasis on the word `criminal,'
as Alexei Alexandrovich did.) ```I warned you of the results in the religious,
the civil, and the domestic aspects. You have not listened to me. Now I
cannot let you disgrace my name'' - `and my son,' she had meant to say,
but about her son she could not jest - ``disgrace my name, and'' - and
more in the same style,' she added. `In general terms, he'll say in his
official manner, and with all distinctness and precision, that he cannot
let me go, but will take all measures in his power to prevent scandal.
And he will calmly and punctiliously act in accordance with his words.
That's what will happen. He's not a man, but a machine - and a spiteful
machine when he's angry,' she added, recalling Alexei Alexandrovich as
she spoke, with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking,
and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him, forgiving
him nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him.

<P>&nbsp;`But, Anna,' said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice, trying
to soothe her, `we absolutely must tell him, at any rate, and then be guided
by the line he takes.'

<P>&nbsp;`What - run away?'

<P>&nbsp;`And why not run away? I don't see how we can keep on like this.
And not for my sake - I see that you suffer.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, run away, and become your mistress,' she said angrily.

<P>&nbsp;`Anna,' he said, with reproachful tenderness.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes,' she went on, `become your mistress, and complete the ruin
of...'

<P>&nbsp;Again she would have said `my son,' but she could not utter that
word.

<P>&nbsp;Vronsky could not understand how she, with her strong and truthful
nature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get out of it.
But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word son, which
she could not utter. When she thought of her son, and his future attitude
to his mother, who had abandoned his father, she felt such terror at what
she had done that she no longer reasoned, but, being a woman, could only
try to comfort herself with lying assurances and words so that everything
should remain as it always had been, and that it was possible to forget
the fearful question of how it would be with her son.

<P>&nbsp;`I beg you, I entreat you,' she said suddenly, taking his hand,
and speaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender, `never speak
to me of that!'

<P>&nbsp;`But, Anna...'

<P>&nbsp;`Never. Leave it to me. I know all the baseness, all the horror
of my position; but it's not so easy to decide as you think. Therefore
leave it to me, and do what I say. Never speak to me of it. Do you promise
me?... No, no, promise!...'

<P>&nbsp;`I promise everything, but I can't be at peace, especially after
what you have told me I can't be at peace, when you can't be at peace....'

<P>&nbsp;`I?' she repeated. `Yes, I am worried sometimes; but that will
pass, if you will never talk about this. When you talk about it - it's
only then it worries me.'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't understand,' he said.

<P>&nbsp;`I know,' she interrupted him, `how hard it is for your truthful
nature to lie, and I grieve for you. I often think, how could you ruin
your whole life for me.'

<P>&nbsp;`I was just thinking the very same thing,' he said; `how could
you sacrifice everything for my sake? I can't forgive myself because you're
unhappy.'

<P>&nbsp;`I unhappy?' she said, coming closer to him, and looking at him
with an ecstatic smile of love. `I am like a hungry man who has been given
food. He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not unhappy.
I unhappy? No, this is my happiness....'

<P>&nbsp;She could hear the sound of her son's voice coming toward them,
and, glancing swiftly round the terrace, she got up impulsively. Her eyes
glowed with the fire he knew so well; with a rapid movement she raised
her lovely hands, covered with rings, took his head, looked into his face
with a protracted gaze, and, putting up her face with smiling, parted lips,
swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes, and thrust him away. She would
have gone, but he held her back.

<P>&nbsp;`When?' he murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her.

<P>&nbsp;`Tonight, at one o'clock,' she whispered, and, with a heavy sigh,
she walked with her light, swift step to meet her son.

<P>&nbsp;Seriozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he
and his nurse had taken shelter in a bower.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, au revoir,' she said to Vronsky. `I must soon be getting
ready for the races. Betsy promised to fetch me.'

<P>&nbsp;Vronsky, looking at his watch, hurriedly drove off.
