PART FIVE</H1>

<H2>
Chapter 1</H2>
Princess Shcherbatskaia considered that it was out of the question for
the wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, since not half
the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time. But she could not but
agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting it off
too late, as an old aunt of Prince Shcherbatsky's was seriously ill and
might die, and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer.
And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts - a larger
and a smaller trousseau - the Princess consented to have the wedding before
Lent. She determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau
all ready now, and the larger part should be sent on later, and she was
much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious
answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not. The
arrangement was the more suitable as, immediately after the wedding, the
newly married couple were to go to the country, where the belongings of
the larger trousseau would not be wanted.

<P>&nbsp;Levin still continued in the same delirious condition, in which
it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole
aim of all existence, and that he need not now think or care about anything,
that everything was being done and would be done for him by others. He
had not even plans and aims for the future, he left its arrangement to
others, knowing that everything would be delightful. His brother, Sergei
Ivanovich, and Stepan Arkadyevich, and the Princess, guided him in doing
what he had to do. All he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested
to him. His brother raised money for him, the Princess advised him to leave
Moscow after the wedding. Stepan Arkadyevich advised him to go abroad.
He agreed to everything. `Do what you choose, if it amuses you, I'm happy,
and my happiness can be no greater and no less because of anything you
do,' he thought. When he told Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevich's advice that
they should go abroad, he was much surprised that she did not agree to
this, and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their
future. She knew Levin had work he loved in the country. She did not, as
he saw, understand this work - she did not even care to understand it.
But that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance.
And therefore she knew their home would be in the country, and she wanted
to go not abroad where she was not going to live, but to the place where
their home would be. This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin.
But since he did not care either way, he immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevich,
as though it were his duty, to go down to the country and to arrange everything
there to the best of his ability, with that taste of which he had so much.

<P>&nbsp;`But, I say,' Stepan Arkadyevich said to him one day after he
had come back from the country, where he had got everything ready for the
young people's arrival, `have you a certificate of having been at confession?'

<P>&nbsp;`No. But what of it?'

<P>&nbsp;`You can't be married without it.'

<P>&nbsp;`My, my, my!' cried Levin. `Why, I believe it's nine years since
I've taken the sacrament! I never thought of it.'

<P>&nbsp;`You're a pretty fellow!' said Stepan Arkadyevich laughing, `and
you call me a Nihilist! But this won't do, you know. You must take the
sacrament.'

<P>&nbsp;`When? There are four days left now.'

<P>&nbsp;Stepan Arkadyevich arranged this also, and Levin had to prepare
himself for the sacrament. To Levin, as to any unbeliever who respects
the beliefs of others, it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at
and to take part in church ceremonies. At this moment, in his present softened
state of feeling, sensitive to everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy
was not merely painful to Levin, it seemed to him utterly impossible. Now,
in the heyday of his highest glory, his fullest flower, he would have to
be a liar or a blasphemer. He felt incapable of being either. But though
he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevich with questions as to the possibility
of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating, Stepan Arkadyevich
maintained that it was out of the question.

<P>&nbsp;`Besides, what is it to you - two days? And he's an awfully fine,
clever old fellow. He'll pull the tooth out for you so gently you won't
notice it.'

<P>&nbsp;Standing at the first mass, Levin attempted to revive in himself
his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed
through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen. But he was at once convinced
that it was utterly impossible to him. He attempted to look at it all as
an empty custom, having no sort of meaning, like the custom of paying calls;
but he felt that he could not do that either. Levin found himself, like
the majority of his contemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard to
religion. Believe he could not, and at the same time he had no firm conviction
that it was all wrong. And consequently, not being able to believe in the
significance of what he was doing, nor to regard it with indifference as
an empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament
he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he
did not himself understand, and what, as an inner voice told him, was therefore
false and wrong.

<P>&nbsp;During the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying
to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then
feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, he tried not
to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and memories
which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle
time of standing in church.

<P>&nbsp;He had stood through the mass, the evening service, and the midnight
service, and the next day he got up earlier than usual, and, without having
tea, went at eight o'clock in the morning to the church for the morning
service and the confession.

<P>&nbsp;There was no one in church but a beggar soldier, two old women,
and the churchmen. A young deacon, whose long back showed in two distinct
halves through his thin undercassock, met him, and, at once going to a
little table at the wall, read the exhortations. During the reading, especially
at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words, `Lord, have mercy
on us!' which sounded like `<I>mercynuslor</I>!' Levin felt that his thought
was shut and sealed up, and that it must not be touched or stirred now,
or else confusion would be the result; and so standing behind the deacon
he went on thinking of his own affairs, neither listening nor examining
what was said. `It's wonderful what expression there is in her hand,' he
thought, remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner
table. They had nothing to talk about, as was almost always the case at
this time, and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting
it, and laughed herself as she watched her action. He remembered how he
had kissed her hand and then had examined the lines on the pink palm. `Another
``<I>mercynuslor</I>!'' thought Levin, crossing himself, bowing, and looking
at the supple spring of the deacon's back bowing before him. `She took
my hand then and examined the lines. ``You've got a splendid hand,' she
said.' And he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon.
`Yes, now it will soon be over,' he thought. `No, it seems to be starting
up again,' he thought, listening to the prayers. `No, it's just ending:
there he is bowing down to the ground. That's always at the end.'

<P>&nbsp;The deacon's hand in a plush cuff unobtrusively accepted a three-rouble
note, and the deacon said he would put Levin's name down in the register,
and, his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church,
he went to the altar. A moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned
to Levin. Thought, till then locked up, began to stir in Levin's head,
but he made haste to drive it away. `It will come right somehow,' he thought,
and went toward the ambo. He went up the steps, and turning to the right,
saw the priest. The priest, a little ancient with a scanty grizzled beard
and weary, good-natured eyes, was standing at the lectern, turning over
the pages of a missal. With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately
reading prayers in an accustomed voice. When he had finished them he bowed
down to the ground and turned, facing Levin.

<P>&nbsp;`Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,' he
said, pointing to the crucifix. `Do you believe in all the doctrines of
the Holy Apostolic Church?' the priest went on, turning his eyes away from
Levin's face and folding his hands under his stole.

<P>&nbsp;`I have doubted - I doubt everything,' said Levin in a voice that
jarred on himself, and he ceased speaking.

<P>&nbsp;The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more,
and closing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent:

<P>&nbsp;`Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray
that God in His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special sins?'
he added, without the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste
time.

<P>&nbsp;`My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything, and for the
most part I am in doubt.'

<P>&nbsp;`Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,' the priest repeated
the same words. `What do you doubt about principally?'

<P>&nbsp;`I doubt everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the existence
of God,' Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at the impropriety
of what he was saying. But Levin's words did not, it seemed, make much
impression on the priest.

<P>&nbsp;`What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?' he
said hurriedly, with a barely perceptible smile.

<P>&nbsp;Levin did not speak.

<P>&nbsp;`What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?'
the priest went on in the rapid customary recitative. `Who has decked the
heavenly firmament with its lights? Who has clothed the earth in its beauty?
How explain it without the Creator?' he said, looking inquiringly at Levin.

<P>&nbsp;Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical
discussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a direct
answer to the question.

<P>&nbsp;`I don't know,' he said.

<P>&nbsp;`You don't know! Then how can you doubt that God created all?'
the priest said, with good-humored perplexity.

<P>&nbsp;`I don't understand it at all,' said Levin, blushing, and feeling
that his words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid
in such a position.

<P>&nbsp;`Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts,
and prayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great power,
and we must resist him. Pray to God, beseech Him. Pray to God,' he repeated
hurriedly.

<P>&nbsp;The priest paused for some time, as though meditating.

<P>&nbsp;`You, I hear, are about to marry the daughter of my parishioner
and son in the spirit, Prince Shcherbatsky?' he resumed, with a smile.
`An excellent young lady.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes,' answered Levin, blushing for the priest. `What does he
want to ask me about this at confession for?' he thought.

<P>&nbsp;And, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him:

<P>&nbsp;`You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless
you with offspring. Are you? - Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give
your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing
you to infidelity?' he said, with gentle reproachfulness. `If you love
your child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor
for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual enlightenment
with the light of truth. Eh? What answer will you make him when the innocent
babe asks you: ``Papa! Who made all that enchants me in this world - the
earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the grass?' Can you say to him:
``I don't know?' You cannot but know, since the Lord God in His infinite
mercy has revealed it to us. Or your child will ask you: ``What awaits
me in the life beyond the grave?' What will you say to him when you know
nothing? How will you answer him? Will you leave him to the allurements
of the world and the devil? That's not right,' he said, and he stopped,
putting his head on one side and looking at Levin with his kindly, gentle
eyes.

<P>&nbsp;Levin made no answer this time, not because he did not want to
enter upon a discussion with the priest, but because no one had ever asked
him such questions - and when his babes did ask him those questions, it
would be time enough to think about answering them.

<P>&nbsp;`You are entering upon a time of life,' pursued the priest, `when
you must choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that He may in His
mercy aid you and have mercy on you!' he concluded. `Our Lord and God,
Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His loving-kindness, forgives
this child...' and, finishing the prayer of absolution, the priest blessed
him and dismissed him.

<P>&nbsp;On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief
at the awkward position being over and having been got through without
his having to tell a lie. Apart from this, there remained a vague memory
that what the kind, fine old fellow had said had not been at all as stupid
as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it that must
be cleared up.

<P>&nbsp;`Of course, not now,' thought Levin, `but at some later day.'
Levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not
clean in his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he was in the same
position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for
which he blamed his friend Sviiazhsky.

<P>&nbsp;Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly's, and was
in very high spirits. To explain to Stepan Arkadyevich the state of excitement
in which he found himself, he said that he was happy, like a dog being
trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea, and
done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps up to
the table and the window sills in its delight.
