Chapter 22</H2>
When Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her eyes,
as though questioning her about the talk she had had with Vronsky, but
she made no inquiry in words.

<P>&nbsp;`I believe it's dinnertime,' she said. `We've not seen each other
at all yet. I am reckoning on the evening. Now I want to go and dress.
I expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.'

<P>&nbsp;Dolly went to her room and she felt amused. To change her dress
was impossible, for she had already put on her best dress. But in order
to signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to
brush her dress, changed her cuffs and rosette, and put some lace on her
head.

<P>&nbsp;`This is all I can do,' she said with a smile to Anna, who came
in to her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, we are too prim here,' she said, as it were apologizing
for her finery. `Alexei is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at
anything. He has completely lost his heart to you,' she added. `You're
not tired?'

<P>&nbsp;There was no time for talking about anything before dinner. Going
into the drawing room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the
gentlemen of the party in black frock coats. The architect wore a swallow-tailed
coat. Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest. The architect
he had already introduced to her at the hospital.

<P>&nbsp;A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin
and a starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies
got up. Vronsky asked Sviiazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself
offered his arm to Dolly. Veslovsky was before Tushkevich in offering his
arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevich with the steward and the doctor
walked in alone.

<P>&nbsp;The dinner, the dining room, the service, the waiting at table,
the wine and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone
of modern luxury throughout the house, but seemed even more sumptuous and
modern. Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her,
and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household - though she never
dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household, as it was all
in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living - she could not
help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom it was all
done. Vassenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviiazhsky, and many other
people she knew, would never have considered this question, and would have
readily believed what every well-bred host tries to make his guests feel,
that is, that all that is well-ordered in his house has cost him, the host,
no trouble whatever, but comes of itself. Darya Alexandrovna was well aware
that even porridge for the children's breakfast does not come of itself,
and that therefore, where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury
was maintained, someone must give earnest attention to its organization.
And from the glance with which Alexei Kirillovich scanned the table, from
the way he nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her choice
between cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it was all organized and maintained
by the care of the master of the house himself. It was evident that it
all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky. She, Sviiazhsky, the
Princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light hearts enjoying
what had been arranged for them.

<P>&nbsp;Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation. The
conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table
with persons present, like the steward and the architect, belonging to
a completely different world, struggling not to be overawed by an elegance
to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to sustain a large share in
the general conversation. But this difficult conversation Anna directed
with her usual tact and naturalness, and indeed she did so with actual
enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna observed.

<P>&nbsp;The conversation began about the row Tushkevich and Veslovsky
had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevich began describing the
last boat races in Peterburg at the Yacht Club. But Anna, seizing the first
pause, at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence.

<P>&nbsp;`Nikolai Ivanich was struck,' she said meaning Sviiazhsky, `at
the progress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am
there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's first-rate working with His Excellency,' said the architect
with a smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his
own dignity). `It's a very different matter to have to do with the district
authorities. Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here
I call upon the Count, and in three words we settle the business.'

<P>&nbsp;`The American way of doing business,' said Sviiazhsky, with a
smile.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....'

<P>&nbsp;The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the
United States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as
to draw the steward into talk.

<P>&nbsp;`Have you ever seen a reaping machine?' she said, addressing Darya
Alexandrovna. `We had just ridden over to look at one when we met. It's
the first time I ever saw one.'

<P>&nbsp;`How do they work?' asked Dolly.

<P>&nbsp;`Exactly like scissors. A plank and a lot of little scissors.
Like this.'

<P>&nbsp;Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands, covered
with rings, and began showing how the machine worked. It was clear that
she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that
her talk was pleasant, and her hands beautiful, she went on explaining.

<P>&nbsp;`More like little penknives,' Veslovsky said playfully, never
taking his eyes off her.

<P>&nbsp;Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer. `Isn't
it true, Karl Fedorich, that it's just like scissors?' she said to the
steward.

<P>&nbsp;`<I>Oh, ja</I>,' answered the German. `<I>Es ist ein ganz einfaches
Ding</I>,' and he began to explain the construction of the machine.

<P>&nbsp;`It's a pity it doesn't bind too. I saw one at the Vienna exhibition,
which binds with a wire,' said Sviiazhsky. `They would be more profitable
in use.'

<P>&nbsp;`<I>Es kommt drauf an... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet
werden</I>.' And the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky.
`<I>Das l&auml;sst sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht</I>.' The German was just
feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always
wrote in, but recollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky's
chilly glance, he checked himself. `<I>Zu compliziert, macht zu viel pains</I>,'
he concluded.

<P>&nbsp;`<I>W&uuml;nscht man gains, so hat man auch pains</I>,' said Vassenka
Veslovsky, bantering the German. `<I>J'adore l'allemand</I>,' he addressed
Anna again with the same smile.

<P>&nbsp;`<I>Cessez</I>,' she said with playful severity.

<P>&nbsp;`We expected to find you in the fields, Vassilii Semionich,' she
said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man; `have you been there?'

<P>&nbsp;`I went there, but I evaporated,' the doctor answered with gloomy
jocoseness.

<P>&nbsp;`Then you've taken a good constitutional?'

<P>&nbsp;`Splendid!'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, and how was the old woman? I hope it's not typhus?'

<P>&nbsp;`Typhus it isn't, but she's not to be found to the best advantage.'

<P>&nbsp;`What a pity!' said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility
to her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.

<P>&nbsp;`It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from
your description, Anna Arkadyevna,' Sviiazhsky said jestingly.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, no, why so?' said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she
knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine,
that had been noticed by Sviiazhsky too. This new trait of girlish coquettishness
made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.

<P>&nbsp;`But Anna Arkadyevna's knowledge of architecture is marvelous,'
said Tushkevich.

<P>&nbsp;`To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna saying yesterday: ``by cramp'
and ``plinths,'' said Veslovsky. `Have I got it right?'

<P>&nbsp;`There's nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so
much of it,' said Anna. `But, I dare say, you don't even know what houses
are made of?'

<P>&nbsp;Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of playfulness
that existed between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her
will.

<P>&nbsp;Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin. He
obviously attached no significance to Veslovsky's chattering; on the contrary,
he encouraged his jests.

<P>&nbsp;`Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?'

<P>&nbsp;`By cement, of course.'

<P>&nbsp;`Bravo! And what is cement?'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, some sort of paste.... No, putty,' said Veslovsky, raising
a general laugh.

<P>&nbsp;The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect,
and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a conversation
that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on another, and
at times stinging one or the other of the company to the quick. Once Darya
Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she positively
flushed and wondered afterward whether she had said anything extreme or
unpleasant. Sviiazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his strange view
that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on Russian agriculture.

<P>&nbsp;`I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,' Vronsky said,
smiling, `but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns; or
if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer fashion,
some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad. What sort of views can
anyone have on such a subject?'

<P>&nbsp;`Turkish views, in general,' Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with
a smile.

<P>&nbsp;`I can't defend his opinions,' Darya Alexandrovna said, flaring
up; `but I can say that he's a highly cultivated man, and if he were here
he would know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of doing
so.'

<P>&nbsp;`I like him extremely, and we are great friends,' Sviiazhsky said,
smiling good-naturedly. `<I>Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toque</I>;
he maintains, for instance, that zemstvoes and justices of the peace are
all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's our Russian apathy,' said Vronsky, pouring water from an
iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; `we've no sense of
the duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize
these duties.'

<P>&nbsp;`I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,'
said Darya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky's tone of superiority.

<P>&nbsp;`For my part,' pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason
or other keenly affected by this conversation, `such as I am, I am, on
the contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks
to Nikolai Ivanich' (he indicated Sviiazhsky), `in electing me an honorary
justice of the peace. I consider that for me the duty of being present
at the session, of judging some peasants' quarrel about a horse, is as
important as anything I can do. And I shall regard it as an honor if they
elect me for the district council. It's only in that way I can pay for
the advantages I enjoy as a landowner. Unluckily they don't understand
the importance that the big landowners ought to have in the state.'

<P>&nbsp;It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident
he was of being right at his own table. She thought how Levin, who believed
the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own table. But
she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.

<P>&nbsp;`So we can reckon upon you, Count, for the coming elections?'
said Sviiazhsky. `But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on
the spot by the eighth. If you would do me the honor to stop with me!'

<P>&nbsp;`I rather agree with your <I>beau-fr&egrave;re</I>', said Anna,
`though not quite on the same ground as he,' she added with a smile. `I'm
afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days.
Just as in the old days there were so many government functionaries that
one had to call in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone's
doing some sort of public duty. Alexei has been here now six months, and
he's a member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies, a
guardian, a justice of the peace, a member of the council, a juryman, an
equine something. <I>Du train que cela va</I>, his whole time will be wasted
on it. And I'm afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they'll
end in being a mere form. How many are you a member of, Nikolai Ivanich?'
she turned to Sviiazhsky. `Over twenty, I fancy.'

<P>&nbsp;Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone.
Darya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it
instantly. She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky's face had immediately
taken a serious and obstinate expression. Noticing this, and that Princess
Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of Peterburg
acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky had without apparent connection
said in the garden of his work in the country, Dolly surmised that this
question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement
between Anna and Vronsky.

<P>&nbsp;The dinner, the wine, the dinner set, were all very good; but
it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and
balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it all had
the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary day
and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on
her.

<P>&nbsp;After dinner they sat on the terrace; then they proceeded to play
lawn tennis. The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides
of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles, on the carefully leveled and rolled
croquet ground. Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but it was
a long time before she could understand the game, and by the time she did
understand it she was so tired that she sat down with Princess Varvara
and simply looked on at the players. Her partner, Tushkevich, gave up playing
too, but the others kept the game up for a long time. Sviiazhsky and Vronsky
both played very well and seriously. They kept a sharp lookout on the balls
served to them, and without loitering, they ran adroitly up to them, waited
for the rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over the net.
Veslovsky played worse than the others. He was too eager, but he kept the
players lively with his high spirits. His laughter and outcries never paused.
Like the other men of the party, with the ladies' permission, he took off
his coat, and his solid, comely figure in his white shirt sleeves, with
his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements, made a picture that
imprinted itself vividly on the memory.

<P>&nbsp;When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she
closed her eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.

<P>&nbsp;During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself. She
did not like the light tone of playfulness that was kept up all the time
between Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness, altogether,
of grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child's game.
But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow,
after a rest she joined the game again, and pretended to be enjoying it.
All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with
actors cleverer than she, and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole
performance.

<P>&nbsp;She had come with the intention of staying two days, if all went
well. But in the evening, during the game, she made up her mind that she
would go home next day. The maternal cares and worries, which she had so
hated on the way, now, after a day spent without them struck her in quite
another light, and tempted her back to them.

<P>&nbsp;When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya
Alexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began arranging
her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.

<P>&nbsp;It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna would
be coming to see her immediately. She longed to be alone with her own thoughts.
