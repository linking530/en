Chapter 4</H2>
The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with his
brother was this. Once, the year previous, he had gone to look at the mowing,
and being made very angry by the bailiff he had had recourse to his favorite
means for regaining his temper - he had taken a scythe from a peasant and
begun mowing.

<P>&nbsp;He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his
hand at mowing since. He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his
house, and this year, ever since the early spring, he had cherished a plan
for mowing for whole days together with the peasants. Ever since his brother's
arrival he had been in doubt as to whether to mow or not. He was loath
to leave his brother alone all day long, and he was afraid his brother
would laugh at him about it. But as he drove into the meadow, and recalled
the sensations of mowing, he came near deciding that he would go mowing.
After the irritating discussion with his brother, he pondered over this
intention again.

<P>&nbsp;`I must have physical exercise, or my temper'll certainly be ruined,'
he thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however awkward he might
feel about it with his brother or the peasants.

<P>&nbsp;Toward evening Konstantin Levin went to his countinghouse, gave
directions as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to summon
the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the largest
and best of his grasslands.

<P>&nbsp;`And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring
it round tomorrow. I may do some mowing myself, too,' he said, trying not
to be embarrassed.

<P>&nbsp;The bailiff smiled and said:

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother too.

<P>&nbsp;`I fancy the fine weather will last,' said he. `Tomorrow I shall
start mowing.'

<P>&nbsp;`I'm so fond of that form of field labor,' said Sergei Ivanovich.

<P>&nbsp;`I'm awfully fond of it. I sometimes mow myself with the peasants,
and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.'

<P>&nbsp;Sergei Ivanovich lifted his head, and looked with curiosity at
his brother.

<P>&nbsp;`How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants, all day long?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, it's very pleasant,' said Levin.

<P>&nbsp;`It's splendid as exercise, only you'll hardly be able to stand
it,' said Sergei Ivanovich, without a shade of irony.

<P>&nbsp;`I've tried it. It's hard work at first, but you get into it.
I dare say I shall manage to keep it up....'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, so that's it! But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?
I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master's being such a queer
fish?'

<P>&nbsp;`No, I don't think so; but it's so delightful, and at the same
time such hard work, that one has no time to think about it.'

<P>&nbsp;`But how will you do about dining with them? To send you a bottle
of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, I'll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.'

<P>&nbsp;Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he
was detained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached the mowing
grass the mowers were already at their second swath.

<P>&nbsp;From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of
the meadow below, with the grayish swaths and the black heaps of coats,
taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting.

<P>&nbsp;Gradually, as he rode toward the meadow, the peasants came into
sight, some in coats, some in their shirts, mowing, one behind another
in a long string, each swinging his scythe in his own way. He counted forty-two
of them.

<P>&nbsp;They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the
meadow, where there had been an old dam. Levin recognized some of his own
men. Here was old Iermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to
swing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a coachman
of Levin's, taking every swath with a wide sweep. Here, too, was Tit, Levin's
preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant. He went on ahead,
and cut his wide swath without bending, as though playing with his scythe.

<P>&nbsp;Levin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside went
to meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it him.

<P>&nbsp;`It's ready, sir; it's like a razor - it cuts of itself,' said
Tit, taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe.

<P>&nbsp;Levin took the scythe, and began trying it. As they finished their
swaths, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one after
another, and smirking, greeted the master. They all stared at him, but
no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a wrinkled, beardless
face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out into the road and accosted
him.

<P>&nbsp;`Look'ee now, master, once take hold of the rope, there's no letting
go!' he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers.

<P>&nbsp;`I'll try not to let it go,' he said, taking his stand behind
Tit, and waiting for the time to begin.

<P>&nbsp;`Mind'ee,' repeated the old man.

<P>&nbsp;Tit made room, and Levin started behind him. The grass was short
close to the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while,
and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, cut badly for the first
moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously. Behind him he heard voices:

<P>&nbsp;`It's not set right; handle's too high; see how he has to stoop
to it,' said one.

<P>&nbsp;`Press more on the heel of the scythe,' said another.

<P>&nbsp;`Never mind, he'll get on all right,' the old man resumed. `See,
he's made a start.... You swing it too wide, you'll tire yourself out....
The master, sure, does his best for himself! But see the grass missed out!
For such work us fellows would catch it!'

<P>&nbsp;The grass became lusher, and Levin, listening without answering,
followed Tit, trying to do the best he could. They moved a hundred paces.
Tit kept moving on, without stopping, nor showing the slightest weariness,
but Levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep it
up - so tired was he.

<P>&nbsp;He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of
his strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop. But at that
very moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and, stooping down, picked up
some grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it. Levin straightened
himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round. Behind him came a peasant,
and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at once without waiting
to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe. Tit sharpened his scythe
and Levin's, and they went on.

<P>&nbsp;The next time it was just the same. Tit moved on with sweep after
sweep of his scythe, without stopping or showing signs of weariness. Levin
followed him, trying not to get left behind, and he found it harder and
harder: the moment came when he felt he had no strength left, but at that
very moment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.

<P>&nbsp;So they mowed the first row. And this long row seemed particularly
hard work to Levin; but when the end was reached, and Tit, shouldering
his scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by
his heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over
the space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his
face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as though he
had been soaked in water, he felt very happy. What delighted him particularly
was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.

<P>&nbsp;His pleasure was only disturbed by his swath not being well cut.
`I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body,' he thought,
comparing Tit's swath, which looked as if it had been cut along a surveyor's
cord, with his own scattered and irregularly lying grass.

<P>&nbsp;The first swath, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed especially quickly,
probably wishing to put his master to the test, and the swath happened
to be a long one. The next swaths were easier, but still Levin had to strain
every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.

<P>&nbsp;He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, save not to be left
behind the peasants, and to do his work as well as possible. He heard nothing
save the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit's upright figure mowing
away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and flowers
slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe, and ahead
of him the end of the swath, where would come the rest.

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what
it was or whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his
hot, moist shoulders. He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting
the scythes. A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops
were falling. Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on;
others - just like Levin himself - merely shrugged their shoulders, enjoying
the pleasant coolness of it.

<P>&nbsp;Another swath, and yet another swath followed - long swaths and
short swaths, with good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost all sense
of time, and could not have told whether it were late or early now. A change
began to come over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction. In the
midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was
doing, and it all came easy to him, and at those same moments his swath
was almost as smooth and well cut as Tit's. But as soon as he recollected
what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at once conscious
of all the difficulty of his task, and the swath was badly mown.

<P>&nbsp;On finishing yet another swath he would have gone back to the
top of the meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up
to the old man said something in a low voice to him. They both looked at
the sun. `What are they talking about, and why doesn't he go back?' thought
Levin, without guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than
four hours without stopping, and that it was time for their lunch.

<P>&nbsp;`Lunch, sir,' said the old man.

<P>&nbsp;`Is it really time? Lunch it is, then.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and, together with the peasants,
who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with
rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went toward his horse.
Only then did he suddenly awake to the fact that he had been wrong about
the weather and that the rain was drenching his hay.

<P>&nbsp;`The hay will be spoiled,' he said.

<P>&nbsp;`Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you'll rake in fine
weather!' said the old man.

<P>&nbsp;Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee.

<P>&nbsp;Sergei Ivanovich was just getting up. When he had drunk his coffee,
Levin rode back again to the mowing before Sergei Ivanovich had had time
to dress and come down to the dining room.
