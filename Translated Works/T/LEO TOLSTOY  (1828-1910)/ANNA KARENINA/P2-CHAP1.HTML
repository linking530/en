<H2>
Chapter 1</H2>
Toward the end of winter, in the house of the Shcherbatskys, a consultation
was being held, which was to determine the state of Kitty's health, and
what was to be done to restore her failing strength. She had been ill,
and, as spring came on, she grew worse. The family doctor gave her cod-liver
oil, then iron, then lunar caustic; but since neither the first, nor the
second, nor the third availed, and since his advice was to go abroad before
the beginning of the spring, a celebrated doctor was called in. The celebrated
doctor, not yet old and a very handsome man, demanded an examination of
the patient. He maintained, with special satisfaction, it seemed, that
maiden modesty is merely a relic of barbarism, and that nothing could be
more natural than for a man who was not yet old to handle a young girl
in the nude. He deemed this natural, because he did it every day, and neither
felt nor thought, as it seemed to him, anything evil as he did it and,
consequently, he considered girlish modesty not merely as a relic of barbarism,
but, as well, an insult to himself.

<P>&nbsp;It was necessary to submit, for, although all the doctors studied
in the same school, all using the same textbooks, and all learned in the
same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was but
a poor doctor, in the Princess's household and circle it was for some reason
held that this celebrated doctor alone had some peculiar knowledge, and
that he alone could save Kitty. After thorough examination and tapping
of the patient, distraught and dazed with shame, the celebrated doctor,
having painstakingly washed his hands, was standing in the drawing room
talking to the Prince. The Prince frowned and coughed as he listened to
the doctor. As a man who had seen something of life, and neither a fool
nor an invalid, he had no faith in medicine, and at soul was wrought up
with all this comedy, especially as he was probably the only one who fully
understood the cause of Kitty's illness. `You're barking up the wrong tree,'
he mentally applied this phrase from the hunter's vocabulary to the celebrated
doctor, as he listened to the latter's patter about the symptoms of his
daughter's complaint. The doctor, for his part, found difficulty in restraining
the expression of his contempt for this old grandee, as well as in condescending
to the low level of his comprehension. He perceived that it was useless
to talk to the old man, and that the head of this house was the mother
- and she it was before whom he intended to scatter his pearls. It was
at this point that the Princess entered the drawing room with the family
doctor. The Prince retreated, doing his best not to betray how ridiculous
he regarded the whole comedy. The Princess was distraught, and did not
know what to do. She felt herself at fault before Kitty.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, doctor, decide our fate,' said the Princess. `Tell me everything.'
- `Is there any hope?' was what she had wanted to say, but her lips quivered,
and she could not utter this question. `Well, doctor?'

<P>&nbsp;`Immediately, Princess - I will discuss the matter with my colleague,
and then have the honor of laying my opinion before you.'

<P>&nbsp;`Then we had better leave you?'

<P>&nbsp;`As you please.'

<P>&nbsp;The Princess, with a sigh, stepped outside.

<P>&nbsp;When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly
explaining his opinion, that there was an incipient tubercular process,
but... and so on. The celebrated doctor listened to him, and in the middle
of the other's speech looked at his big gold watch.

<P>&nbsp;`That is so,' said he. `But...'

<P>&nbsp;The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his speech.

<P>&nbsp;`As you know, we cannot determine the incipience of the tubercular
process; until the appearance of vomicae there is nothing determinate.
But we may suspect it. And there are indications: malnutrition, nervous
excitability, and so on. The question stands thus: if we suspect a tubercular
process, what must we do to maintain nutrition?'

<P>&nbsp;`But then, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes
at the back of these cases,' the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate
with a subtle smile.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, that's to be taken for granted,' retorted the celebrated
doctor, again glancing at his watch. `Beg pardon - but is the Iauzsky bridge
finished yet, or must one still make a detour?' he asked. `Ah! It is finished.
Well, in that case I can make it in twenty minutes. As we were saying,
the question may be posited thus: the nutrition must be maintained and
the nerves improved. The one is bound with the other; one must work upon
both sides of this circle.'

<P>&nbsp;`But what about the trip abroad?' asked the family doctor.

<P>&nbsp;`I am a foe to trips abroad. And take notice: if there is any
incipient tubercular process, which we cannot know, a trip abroad will
not help. We must have a remedy that would improve nutrition, and do no
harm.'

<P>&nbsp;And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with
Soden waters, in designating which his main end was evidently their harmlessness.

<P>&nbsp;The family doctor heard him out attentively and respectfully.

<P>&nbsp;`But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits,
the removal from conditions which evoke memories. And then - the mother
wishes it,' he added.

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! Well, in that case, one might go; well, let them go; but
those German charlatans may do harm.... Our instructions ought to be followed....
Well, let them go then.'

<P>&nbsp;He again glanced at his watch.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh! it's time to go,' and he went to the door.

<P>&nbsp;The celebrated doctor informed the Princess (prompted by a feeling
of propriety) that he must see the patient once more.

<P>&nbsp;`What! Another examination!' the mother exclaimed in horror.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, no - I merely need certain details, Princess.'

<P>&nbsp;`Come this way.'

<P>&nbsp;And the mother, followed by the doctor, went into the drawing
room to Kitty. Wasted and blushing, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes
- a consequence of the shame she had gone through, Kitty was standing in
the middle of the room. When the doctor came in she turned crimson, and
her eyes filled with tears. All her illness and its treatment seemed to
her a thing so stupid - even funny! Treatment seemed to her as funny as
reconstructing the pieces of a broken vase. It was her heart that was broken.
Why, then, did they want to cure her with pills and powders? But she could
not hurt her mother - all the more so since her mother considered herself
to blame.

<P>&nbsp;`May I trouble you to sit down, Princess?' the celebrated doctor
said to her.

<P>&nbsp;Smiling, he, sat down facing her, felt her pulse, and again started
in with his tiresome questions. She answered him, and suddenly, becoming
angry, got up.

<P>&nbsp;`You must pardon me, doctor - but really, this will lead us nowhere.
You ask me the same things, three times running.'

<P>&nbsp;The celebrated doctor did not take umbrage.

<P>&nbsp;`Sickly irritability,' said he to the Princess, when Kitty had
left the room. `However, I had finished....'

<P>&nbsp;And the doctor scientifically defined to the Princess, as to an
exceptionally clever woman, the condition of the young Princess, and concluded
by explaining the mode of drinking the unnecessary waters. When the question
of going abroad came up, the doctor was plunged into profound considerations,
as though deciding a weighty problem. Finally his decision was given: they
might go abroad, but must put no faith in charlatans, but turn to him in
everything.

<P>&nbsp;It seemed as though some cheerful influence had sprung up after
the doctor's departure. The mother grew more cheerful when she returned
to her daughter, while Kitty too pretended to be more cheerful. She had
frequent, almost constant, occasions to be pretending now.

<P>&nbsp;`Really, I'm quite well, maman. But if you want to go abroad,
let's!' she said, and, trying to show that she was interested in the proposed
trip, she began talking of the preparations for the departure.
