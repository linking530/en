Chapter 6</H2>
The Mashkin Upland was mown, the last swaths finished, the peasants had
put on their coats and were gaily trudging home. Levin got on his horse,
and, parting regretfully from the peasants, rode homeward. On the hillside
he looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the
valley; he could only hear their rough, good-humored voices, their laughter,
and the sound of clanking scythes.

<P>&nbsp;Sergei Ivanovich had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking
iced lemonade in his own room, looking through the reviews and papers which
he had just received by post, when Levin rushed into the room, talking
merrily, with his wet and matted hair sticking to his forehead, and his
back and chest grimed and moist.

<P>&nbsp;`We mowed the whole meadow! Oh, it is fine, wonderful! And how
have you been getting on?' said Levin, completely forgetting the disagreeable
conversation of the previous day.

<P>&nbsp;`Dear me! What you look like!' said Sergei Ivanovich, for the
first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction. `And the door - do
shut the door!' he cried. `You must have let in a dozen at least.'

<P>&nbsp;Sergei Ivanovich could not endure flies, and in his own room he
never opened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut.

<P>&nbsp;`Not one, on my honor. But if I have, I'll catch them. You wouldn't
believe what a pleasure mowing is! How have you spent the day?'

<P>&nbsp;`Very well. But have you really been mowing the whole day? I expect
you're as hungry as a wolf. Kouzma has got everything ready for you.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, I don't feel hungry even. I had something to eat there. But
I'll go and wash.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, go along, go along, and I'll come to you directly,' said
Sergei Ivanovich, shaking his head as he looked at his brother. `Go along,
make haste,' he added smiling, and, gathering up his books, he prepared
to go too. He, too, felt suddenly good-humored and disinclined to leave
his brother's side. `But what did you do while it was raining?'

<P>&nbsp;`Rain? Why, there was scarcely a drop. I'll come directly. So
you had a good day too? That's first-rate.' And Levin went off to change
his clothes.

<P>&nbsp;Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room. Although
it seemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner simply
so as not to hurt Kouzma's feelings, yet when he began to eat the dinner
struck him as extraordinarily good. Sergei Ivanovich watched him with a
smile.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, by the way, there's a letter for you,' said he. `Kouzma,
bring it from below, please. And mind you shut the doors.'

<P>&nbsp;The letter was from Oblonsky. Levin read it aloud. Oblonsky wrote
to him from Peterburg: `I have had a letter from Dolly; she's at Ergushovo,
and everything seems going wrong there. Do ride over and see her, please;
help her with advice; you know all about it. She will be so glad to see
you. She's quite alone, poor thing. My mother-in-law and all of them are
still abroad.'

<P>&nbsp;`That's capital! I will certainly ride over to her,' said Levin.
`Or we'll go together. She's such a good woman, isn't she?'

<P>&nbsp;`They're not far from here, then?'

<P>&nbsp;`Thirty verstas. Or perhaps forty. But a capital road. It will
be a capital drive.'

<P>&nbsp;`I shall be delighted,' said Sergei Ivanovich, still smiling.

<P>&nbsp;The sight of his younger brother's appearance had immediately
put him in a good humor.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, you have an appetite!' he said, looking at his dark-red,
sunburned face and neck bent over the plate.

<P>&nbsp;`Splendid! You can't imagine what an effective remedy it is for
every sort of foolishness. I want to enrich medicine with a new word: <I>Arbeitskur</I>.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, but you don't need it, I should fancy.'

<P>&nbsp;`No - but for all sorts of nervous invalids.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, it ought to be tried. I had meant to come to the mowing
to look at you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than
the forest. I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village,
met your old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasant's view of you. As
far as I can make out, they don't approve of this. She said: ``It's not
a gentleman's work.' Altogether, I fancy that in the people's ideas there
are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it, ``gentlemanly'
lines of action. And they don't sanction the gentlefolk's moving outside
bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.'

<P>&nbsp;`Maybe so; but anyway, it's a pleasure such as I have never known
in my life. And there's no harm in it, you know. Is there?' answered Levin.
`I can't help it if they don't like it. Though I do believe it's all right.
Eh?'

<P>&nbsp;`Altogether,' pursued Sergei Ivanovich, `you're satisfied with
your day?'

<P>&nbsp;`Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And I made friends
with such a splendid old man there! You can't fancy how delightful he was!'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, so you're satisfied with your day. And so am I. First,
I solved two chess problems, and one a very pretty one - a pawn opening.
I'll show it to you. And then - I thought over our conversation of yesterday.'

<P>&nbsp;`Eh! Our conversation of yesterday?' said Levin, blissfully dropping
his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner, and absolutely
incapable of recalling what their conversation of yesterday had been about.

<P>&nbsp;`I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts
to this: that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I contend that
interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain
degree of advancement. Possibly you are right too - that action founded
on material interest would be more desirable. You are altogether, as the
French say, too <I>primesauti&egrave;re</I> a nature; you must have intense,
energetic action, or nothing.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single
word, and did not want to understand. He was only afraid his brother might
ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard.

<P>&nbsp;`So that's what I think it is, my dear boy,' said Sergei Ivanovich,
touching him on the shoulder.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, of course. But, do you know? I won't stand up for my view,'
answered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile. `Whatever was it I was
disputing about?' he wondered. `Of course, I'm right, and he's right, and
it's all first-rate. Only I must go round to the countinghouse and see
to things.' He got up, stretching and smiling.

<P>&nbsp;Sergei Ivanovich smiled too.

<P>&nbsp;`If you want to go out, let's go together,' he said, disinclined
to be parted from his brother, who seemed positively breathing out freshness
and energy. `Come, we'll go to the countinghouse, if you have to go there.'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, heavens!' shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergei Ivanovich
was quite frightened.

<P>&nbsp;`What, what is the matter?

<P>&nbsp;`How's Agathya Mikhailovna's hand?' said Levin, slapping himself
on the head. `I'd positively forgotten her.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's much better.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, anyway, I'll run down to her. Before you've time to get
your hat on, I'll be back.'

<P>&nbsp;And he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring
rattle.
