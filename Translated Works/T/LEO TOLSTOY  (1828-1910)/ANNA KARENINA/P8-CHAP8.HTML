Chapter 8</H2>
Ever since, by his beloved brother's deathbed, Levin had first glanced
into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions,
as he called them, which had during the period from his twentieth to his
thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs
- he had been stricken with horror, not so much of death, as of life, without
any knowledge of whence, and why, and how, and what it was. The physical
organization, its decay, the Indestructibility of matter, the law of the
conservation of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place
of his old belief. These words and the ideas associated with them were
very well for intellectual purposes. But for life they yielded nothing,
and Levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for
a muslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately
convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature, that he is as good as
naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.

<P>&nbsp;From that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still
went on living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at
his lack of knowledge.

<P>&nbsp;He vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions
were not merely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order
of ideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible.

<P>&nbsp;At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with
it, had completely crowded out these thoughts. But of late, while he was
staying in Moscow after his wife's confinement, with nothing to do, the
question that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and more
insistently, haunted Levin's mind.

<P>&nbsp;The question was summed up for him thus: `If I do not accept the
answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do
I accept?' And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, so far from finding
any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable to find anything at all
like an answer.

<P>&nbsp;He was in the position of a man seeking food in toyshops and firearm
shops.

<P>&nbsp;Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation,
with every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these questions
and their solution.

<P>&nbsp;What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the
majority of men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged their old
beliefs for the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in
this, and were perfectly satisfied and serene. So that, apart from the
principal question, Levin was tortured by other questions too: were these
people sincere? or were they playing a part? or was it that they understood
the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense
than he did? And he assiduously studied both these men's opinions and the
books which treated of these scientific explanations.

<P>&nbsp;One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed
his mind - that he had been quite wrong in supposing, from the recollections
of the university circle of his young days, that religion had outlived
its day, and that it was now practically nonexistent. All the people nearest
to him who were good in their lives were believers. The old Prince, and
Lvov, whom he liked so much, and Sergei Ivanovich; and all the women believed;
and his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood;
and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian people, all the people for whose
life he felt the deepest respect, believed.

<P>&nbsp;Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many
books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction
to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which
he felt he could not live without answering, but simply ignored their existence
and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him,
such as the evolution of organisms, the mechanistic theory of the soul,
etc.

<P>&nbsp;Moreover, during his wife's confinement, something had happened
that seemed extraordinary to him. He, an unbeliever, had fallen into praying,
and at the moment he prayed, he believed. But that moment had passed, and
he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of
his life.

<P>&nbsp;He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and
that now he was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it,
it all fell to pieces. He could not admit that he was mistaken then, for
his spiritual condition then was precious to him, and to admit that it
was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments. He
was miserably divided against himself, and strained all his spiritual forces
to the utmost to escape from this condition.
