Chapter 6</H2>
Sergei Ivanovich had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet him,
as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow. Levin was not
at home when Katavassov and Sergei Ivanovich, in a wagonette hired at the
station, drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as Negroes
from the dust of the road. Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her father
and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet him.

<P>&nbsp;`What a shame not to have let us know,' she said, giving her hand
to Sergei Ivanovich, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.

<P>&nbsp;`We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,' answered
Sergei Ivanovich. `I'm so dirty. I'm afraid to touch you. I've been so
busy, I didn't know when I should be able to tear myself away. And so you're
still as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet happiness,' he said, smiling,
`out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater. Here's our
friend Fiodor Vassilievich, successful in getting here at last.'

<P>&nbsp;`But I'm not a Negro; I shall look like a human being when I wash,'
said Katavassov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled,
his teeth flashing white in his black face.

<P>&nbsp;`Kostia will be delighted. He has gone to his grange. It's time
he should be home.'

<P>&nbsp;`Busy as ever with his farming. It really is a peaceful backwater,'
said Katavassov; `while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.
Well, how does our friend look at it? He's sure not to think like other
people.'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, I don't know, he's like everybody else,' Kitty answered,
a little embarrassed, looking round at Sergei Ivanovich. `I'll send to
fetch him. Papa's staying with us. He's only just come home from abroad.'

<P>&nbsp;And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to
wash, one in his room and the other in what had been Dolly's, and giving
orders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out on the balcony, enjoying the freedom
and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during the months
of her pregnancy.

<P>&nbsp;`It's Sergei Ivanovich and Katavassov, a professor,' she said.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, it's hard in such a heat,' said the Prince.

<P>&nbsp;`No, papa, he's very nice, and Kostia's very fond of him,' Kitty
said, with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father's face.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, I didn't say anything.'

<P>&nbsp;`You go to them, darling,' said Kitty to her sister, `and entertain
them. They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well. And I must run
to Mitia. As ill luck would have it, I haven't fed him since tea. He's
awake now, and sure to be screaming.' And, feeling a rush of milk, she
hurried to the nursery.

<P>&nbsp;This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still
so close that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food,
and knew for certain he was hungry.

<P>&nbsp;She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery. And he
was indeed crying. She heard him and hastened. But the faster she went
the louder he screamed. It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.

<P>&nbsp;`Has he been screaming long, nurse - very long?' said Kitty, hurriedly
seating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby the breast.
`But give me him quickly. Oh, nurse, how tiresome you are! There, tie the
cap afterward, do!'

<P>&nbsp;The baby's greedy scream was passing into sobs.

<P>&nbsp;`But you can't manage so, ma'am,' said Agathya Mikhailovna, who
was almost always to be found in the nursery. `He must be put straight.
A-oo! A-oo!' she chanted over him, paying no attention to the mother.

<P>&nbsp;The nurse brought the baby to his mother. Agathya Mikhailovna
followed him with a face melting with tenderness.

<P>&nbsp;`He knows me, he knows me. In God's faith, Katerina Alexandrovna,
ma'am, he recognized me!' Agathya Mikhailovna cried above the baby's screams.

<P>&nbsp;But Kitty did not hear her words. Her impatience kept growing,
like the baby's.

<P>&nbsp;Their impatience hindered things for a while. The baby could not
get hold of the breast right, and was furious.

<P>&nbsp;At last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking,
things went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed, and
both subsided into calm.

<P>&nbsp;`But poor darling, he's all in perspiration!' said Kitty in a
whisper, touching the baby. `What makes you think he knows you?' she added,
with a sidelong glance at the baby's eyes, that peered roguishly, as she
fancied, from under his cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the
little red-palmed hand he was waving.

<P>&nbsp;`Impossible! If he knew anyone, he would have known me,' said
Kitty, in response to Agathya Mikhailovna's statement, and she smiled.

<P>&nbsp;She smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in
her heart she was sure that he knew not merely Agathya Mikhailovna, but
that he knew and understood everything, and knew and understood a great
deal too that no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and
come to understand only through him. To Agathya Mikhailovna, to the nurse,
to his grandfather, to his father even, Mitia was a living being, requiring
only material care, but for his mother he had long been a moral being,
with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already.

<P>&nbsp;`When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself. Then
when I do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! Simply beams like
a sunny day!' said Agathya Mikhailovna.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, well; then we shall see,' whispered Kitty. `But now go
away, he's going to sleep.'
