Chapter 6</H2>
Princess Betsy drove home from the theater without waiting for the end
of the last act. She had just time enough to go into her dressing room,
sprinkle her long, pale face with powder, rub it off, set her dress to
rights, and order tea in the big drawing room, when one after another carriages
drove up to her huge house on the Bolshaia Morskaia. Her guests dismounted
at the wide entrance, and the stout porter, who used to read newspapers
mornings behind the glass door, to the edification of the passers-by, noiselessly
opened the immense door, letting the visitors pass by him into the house.

<P>&nbsp;Almost at the same instant that the hostess, with freshly arranged
coiffure and freshened face, entered at one door, her guests entered at
the other, into the drawing room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs
and a brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, the whiteness
of napery, the silver of the samovar and the tea service of transparent
porcelain.

<P>&nbsp;The hostess sat down at the samovar and took off her gloves. Chairs
were set with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the
room; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the
samovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing
room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply
defined black eyebrows. In both groups conversation wavered, as it always
does, for the first few minutes, broken up by meetings, salutations, offers
of tea, and, as it were, seeking for some point in common.

<P>&nbsp;`She's exceptionally fine as an actress; one can see she's studied
Kaulbach,' said a diplomatist in the circle of the ambassador's wife. `Did
you notice how she fell down?...'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, please, don't let us talk about Nilsson! No one can possibly
say anything new about her,' said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady,
without eyebrows and without chignon, wearing an old silk dress. This was
Princess Miaghkaia, noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners,
and nicknamed <I>enfant terrible</I>. Princess Miaghkaia was seated halfway
between the two groups, and, listening to both, took part in the conversation
first of one and then of the other. `Three people have used that very phrase
about Kaulbach to me today, just as though they had conspired. And I don't
know why that phrase should be so much to their liking.'

<P>&nbsp;The conversation was cut short by this observation, and again
a new subject had to be thought of.

<P>&nbsp;`Do tell us something amusing, yet not spiteful,' said the ambassador's
wife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called
by the English small talk. She addressed the diplomatist, who was now at
a loss just what to begin upon.

<P>&nbsp;`That is said to be a difficult task - only that which is spiteful
is supposed to be amusing,' he began with a smile. `However, I'll make
the attempt. Give me a theme. it's all a matter of the theme. If the theme
be but given, it's easy enough to embroider it. I often think that the
celebrated conversationalists of the last century would find it difficult
to talk cleverly now. Everything clever has become such a bore....'

<P>&nbsp;`That has been said long ago,' the ambassador's wife interrupted
him, laughing.

<P>&nbsp;The conversation had begun amiably, but just because it was too
amiable, it came to a stop again. They had to have recourse to the sure,
never-failing remedy - malicious gossip.

<P>&nbsp;`Don't you think there's something Louis Quinze about Tushkevich?'
he said, glancing toward a handsome, fair-haired young man, standing at
the table.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, yes! He's in the same style as the drawing room, and that's
why it is he's so often here.'

<P>&nbsp;This conversation was kept up, since it depended on allusions
to what could not be talked of in that room - that is to say, of the relations
of Tushkevich with their hostess.

<P>&nbsp;Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation having, in
the meanwhile, vacillated in precisely the same way between the three inevitable
topics - the latest piece of public news, the theater, and censuring the
fellow creature - had finally come to rest on the last topic - that is,
malicious gossip.

<P>&nbsp;`Have you heard that even the Maltishcheva - the mother, not the
daughter - has ordered a costume in <I>diable rose</I> color?'

<P>&nbsp;`Impossible! No, that's just charming!'

<P>&nbsp;`I wonder that with her sense - for after all she's no fool -
she doesn't see how funny she is.'

<P>&nbsp;Every one had something to say in censure or ridicule of the hapless
Maltishcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a blazing bonfire.

<P>&nbsp;The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured corpulent man, an
ardent collector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, had
come into the drawing room before leaving for his club. Stepping noiselessly
over the thick rugs, he approached Princess Miaghkaia.

<P>&nbsp;`How did you like Nilsson?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, how can you steal up on anyone like that! How you startled
me!' she responded. `Please don't talk to me about the opera; you know
nothing about music. I'd rather come down to your own level, and discuss
with you your majolica and engravings. Come, now, what treasure have you
been buying lately at the rag fair?'

<P>&nbsp;`Would you like me to show you? But you don't understand such
things.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, show me. I've been learning about them at those - what's
their names?... those bankers... They have some splendid engravings. They
showed them to us.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why, have you been at the Schutzburgs?' asked the hostess from
behind the samovar.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, <I>ma ch&egrave;re</I>. They asked my husband and myself
to dinner, and I was told that the sauce at that dinner cost a thousand
roubles,' Princess Miaghkaia said, speaking loudly, conscious that all
were listening; `and very nasty sauce it was - some green mess. We had
to ask them, and I made a sauce for eighty-five kopecks, and everybody
was very much pleased with it. I can't afford thousand-rouble sauces.'

<P>&nbsp;`She's unique!' said the lady of the house.

<P>&nbsp;`Amazing!' somebody else added.

<P>&nbsp;The effect produced by Princess Miaghkaia's speeches was always
the same, and the secret of the effect she produced lay in the fact that
though she spoke not always appropriately, as now, she said homely truths,
not devoid of sense. In the society in which she lived such utterances
had the same result as the most pungent wit. Princess Miaghkaia could never
see why it had that result, but she knew it had, and took advantage of
it.

<P>&nbsp;Since everyone had been listening while Princess Miaghkaia spoke,
and the conversation around the ambassador's wife had dropped, Princess
Betsy tried to bring the whole party together, and she addressed the ambassador's
wife.

<P>&nbsp;`Really won't you have tea? Do come and join us.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, we're very comfortable here,' the ambassador's wife responded
with a smile, and went on with the interrupted conversation.

<P>&nbsp;It was a most agreeable conversation. They were censuring the
Karenins, husband and wife.

<P>&nbsp;`Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There's something
strange about her,' said one of her feminine friends.

<P>&nbsp;`The great change is that she has brought back with her the shadow
of Alexei Vronsky,' said the ambassador's wife.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, what of it? There's a fable of Grimm's about a man without
a shadow - a man deprived of his shadow. As a punishment for something
or other. I never could understand just how this was a punishment. Yet
a woman must probably feel uncomfortable without a shadow.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, but women followed by a shadow usually come to a bad end,'
said Anna's friend.

<P>&nbsp;`Bite your tongue!' said Princess Miaghkaia suddenly. `Karenina
is a splendid woman. I don't like her husband - but her I like very much.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why don't you like her husband? He's such a remarkable man,'
said the ambassador's wife. `My husband says there are few statesmen like
him in Europe.'

<P>&nbsp;`And my husband tells me just the same, but I don't believe it,'
said Princess Miaghkaia. `If our husbands didn't talk to us, we should
see the facts as they are. Alexei Alexandrovich, to my thinking, is simply
a fool. I say it in a whisper.... But doesn't it really make everything
clear? Before, when I was told to consider him clever, I kept looking for
his ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but directly
I said, he's a fool, though only in a whisper, everything became clear
- isn't that so?'

<P>&nbsp;`How spiteful you are today!'

<P>&nbsp;`Not a bit. I'd no other way out of it. One of us two had to be
the fool. And, as you know, one could never say that of oneself.'

<P>&nbsp;`No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied
with his wit,' the diplomatist repeated the French saying.

<P>&nbsp;`That's it - that's just it,' Princess Miaghkaia turned to him
promptly. `But the point is that I won't abandon Anna to your mercies.
She's such a dear, so charming. How can she help it if they're all in love
with her, and follow her about like shadows?'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, I had no idea of censuring her,' Anna's friend said in self-defense.

<P>&nbsp;`If we have no shadows following us, it does not prove that we've
any right to blame her.'

<P>&nbsp;And, having duly disposed of Anna's friend, the Princess Miaghkaia
got up, and, together with the ambassador's wife, joined the group at the
table, where the general conversation had to do with the king of Prussia.

<P>&nbsp;`What were you gossiping so maliciously about?' asked Betsy.

<P>&nbsp;`About the Karenins. The Princess gave us a character sketch of
Alexei Alexandrovich,' said the ambassador's wife with a smile, as she
sat down at the table.

<P>&nbsp;`Pity we didn't hear it!' said Princess Betsy, glancing toward
the door. `Ah, here you are at last!' she said, turning with a smile to
Vronsky who was entering.

<P>&nbsp;Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he
was meeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the
quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people whom one had left
only a short while ago.

<P>&nbsp;`Where do I come from?' he repeated the question of the ambassador's
wife. `Well, there's no help for it - I must confess. From the opera bouffe.
I do believe I've seen it a hundred times, and always with fresh enjoyment.
It's exquisite! I know it's disgraceful, but I go to sleep at the opera,
yet I sit out the opera bouffe to the last minute, and enjoy it. This evening...'

<P>&nbsp;He mentioned a French actress, and was about to tell something
about her; but the ambassador's wife, with playful trepidation, cut him
short.

<P>&nbsp;`Please, don't tell us about that horror.'

<P>&nbsp;`Very well, I won't - especially as everyone knows those horrors.'

<P>&nbsp;`And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct
thing, like the opera,' chimed in Princess Miaghkaia.
