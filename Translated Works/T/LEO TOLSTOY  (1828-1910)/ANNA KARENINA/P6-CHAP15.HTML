Chapter 15</H2>
After escorting his wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly's part of the house.
Darya Alexandrovna, for her part, was also in great distress that day.
She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl, who stood
in the corner bawling.

<P>&nbsp;`And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner
all alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won't make you a new frock,'
she said, not knowing how to punish her.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, she is a disgusting child!' she turned to Levin. `Where does
she get such wicked propensities?'

<P>&nbsp;`Why, what has she done?' Levin said without much interest, for
he had wanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come at
an unlucky moment.

<P>&nbsp;`Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there... I can't
tell you really what she did. It's a thousand pities Miss Elliot's not
with us. This one sees to nothing - she's a machine.... <I>Figurez-vous
que la petite</I>?...'

<P>&nbsp;And Darya Alexandrovna described Masha's crime.

<P>&nbsp;`That proves nothing; it's not a question of evil propensities
at all, it's simply mischief,' Levin assured her.

<P>&nbsp;`But you are upset about something? What have you come for?' asked
Dolly. `What's going on there?'

<P>&nbsp;And in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy
for him to say what he had meant to say.

<P>&nbsp;`I've not been in there, I've been alone in the garden with Kitty.
We've had a quarrel for the second time since... Stiva came.'

<P>&nbsp;Dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.

<P>&nbsp;`Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been... Not in Kitty,
but in that gentleman's behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant - not
unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?'

<P>&nbsp;`You mean, how shall I say... Stand there - stand in the corner!'
she said to Masha, who, detecting a faint smile on her mother's face, had
been turning round. `The opinion of the world would be that he is behaving
as young men do behave. <I>Il fait le cour &agrave; une jeune et jolie
femme</I>, and a husband who's a man of the world should only be flattered
by it.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, yes,' said Levin gloomily; `but you noticed it?'

<P>&nbsp;`Not only I, but Stiva noticed it. Just after breakfast he said
to me: <I>Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour &agrave;</I>
Kitty.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, that's all right then; now I'm satisfied. I'll send him
away,' said Levin.

<P>&nbsp;`What do you mean! Are you crazy?' Dolly cried in horror. `Nonsense,
Kostia, only think!' she said, laughing. `You can go now to Fanny,' she
said to Masha. `No, if you wish it, I'll speak to Stiva. He'll take him
away. He can say you're expecting visitors. Altogether he doesn't fit into
the house.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, no, I'll do it myself.'

<P>&nbsp;`But you'll quarrel with him?'

<P>&nbsp;`Not a bit. I shall so enjoy it,' Levin said, his eyes flashing
with real enjoyment. `Come, forgive her, Dolly, she won't do it again,'
he said of the little sinner, who had not gone to Fanny, but was standing
irresolutely before her mother, waiting and looking up from under her brows
to catch her mother's eye.

<P>&nbsp;The mother glanced at her. The child broke into sobs, hid her
face on her mother's lap, and Dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her head.

<P>&nbsp;`And what is there in common between us and him?' thought Levin,
and he went off to look for Veslovsky.

<P>&nbsp;As he passed through the hall he gave orders for the carriage
to be got ready to drive to the station.

<P>&nbsp;`The spring was broken yesterday,' said the footman.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, the tarantass then, and make haste. Where's the visitor?'

<P>&nbsp;`The gentleman's gone to his room.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin came upon Vassenka at the moment when the latter, having
unpacked his things from his trunk, and laid out some new songs, was putting
on his leather gaiters to go out riding.

<P>&nbsp;Whether there was something exceptional in Levin's face, or that
Vassenka was himself conscious that <I>le petit brin de cour</I> he was
making was out of place in this family; he was somewhat (as much as a young
man in society can be) disconcerted at Levin's entrance.

<P>&nbsp;`You ride in gaiters?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, it's much cleaner,' said Vassenka, putting his fat leg on
a chair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with simplehearted good
humor.

<P>&nbsp;He was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry
for him and ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on
Vassenka's face.

<P>&nbsp;On the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together
that morning at gymnastics, trying to raise up the swollen bars. Levin
took the fragment in his hands and began breaking off the split end of
the stick, not knowing how to begin.

<P>&nbsp;`I wanted...' He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and everything
that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the face: `I have
ordered the horses to be put to for you.'

<P>&nbsp;`How so?' Vassenka began in surprise. `To drive where?'

<P>&nbsp;`For you to drive to the station,' Levin said gloomily pinching
off the end of the stick.

<P>&nbsp;`Are you going away, or has something happened?'

<P>&nbsp;`It happens that I expect visitors,' said Levin, his strong fingers
more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick. `And I'm
not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to go away.
You can explain my rudeness as you like.'

<P>&nbsp;Vassenka drew himself up.

<P>&nbsp;`I beg you to explain...' he said with dignity, understanding
at last.

<P>&nbsp;`I can't explain,' Levin said softly and deliberately, trying
to control the trembling of his jaw; `and you'd better not ask.'

<P>&nbsp;And as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the
thick ends in his finger, split the stick in two, and carefully caught
the end as it fell.

<P>&nbsp;Probably the sight of those tense hands, of the same muscles he
had proved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft
voice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words. He
bowed, shrugging his shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.

<P>&nbsp;`May I not see Oblonsky?'

<P>&nbsp;The shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin. `What else was
there for him to do?' he thought.

<P>&nbsp;`I'll send him to you at once.'

<P>&nbsp;`What madness is this?' Stepan Arkadyevich said when, after hearing
from his friend that he was being turned out of the house, he found Levin
in the garden, where he was walking about waiting for his guest's departure.
`<I>Mais c'est ridicule</I>! What flea has bitten you? <I>Mais c'est du
dernier ridicule</I>! What did you think, if a young man...'

<P>&nbsp;But the place where Levin had been bitten was evidently still
sore, for he turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevich would have enlarged
on the reason, and he himself cut him short.

<P>&nbsp;`Please don't go into it! I can't help it. I feel ashamed of the
way I'm treating you and him. But it won't be, I imagine, a great grief
to him to go, and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.'

<P>&nbsp;`But it's insulting to him! <I>Et puis c'est ridicule</I>.'

<P>&nbsp;`And to me it's both insulting and distressing! And I'm not in
fault in any way, and there's no need for me to suffer.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, this I didn't expect of you! <I>On peut &ecirc;tre jaloux,
mais &agrave; ce point c'est du dernier ridicule</I>!'

<P>&nbsp;Levin turned quickly, and walked away from him into the depths
of the avenue, and he went on walking up and down alone. Soon he heard
the rumble of the <I>tarantass</I>, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka,
sitting in the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the <I>tarantass</I>)
in his Scotch cap, was driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over
the ruts.

<P>&nbsp;`What's this?' Levin thought, when a footman ran out of the house
and stopped the <I>tarantass</I>. It was the mechanician, whom Levin had
totally forgotten. The mechanician, bowing low, said something to Veslovsky,
then clambered into the <I>tarantass</I> and they drove off together.

<P>&nbsp;Stepan Arkadyevich and the Princess were much upset by Levin's
action. And he himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule, but
also utterly guilty and disgraced. But remembering what sufferings he and
his wife had been through, when he asked himself how he should act another
time, he answered that he would do precisely the same.

<P>&nbsp;In spite of all this, toward the end of that day, everyone, except
the Princess, who could not pardon Levin's action, became extraordinarily
lively and good-humored, like children after a punishment, or grown-up
people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening Vassenka's
dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the Princess, as though it were
some remote event. And Dolly, who had inherited her father's gift of humorous
storytelling, made Varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the
third and fourth time, always with fresh humorous additions, how she had
just put on her new ribands for the benefit of the visitor, and, on going
into the drawing room, had suddenly heard the rumble of the chariot. And
who should be in the chariot but Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap,
and his songs, and his gaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.

<P>&nbsp;`If only you'd ordered out the carriage! But no! And then I hear:
``Stop!' Oh, I thought they've relented. I look out - and a fat German
is being sat down by him, and they're driving away... And my new ribands
all for nothing!...'
