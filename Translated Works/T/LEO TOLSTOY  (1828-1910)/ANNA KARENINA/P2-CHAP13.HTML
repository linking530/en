Chapter 13</H2>
Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth overcoat instead
of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping over streams
of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes, and stepping
one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.

<P>&nbsp;Spring is the time of plans and projects. And, as he came out
into the farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form
will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling
buds, hardly knew what undertakings he was going to launch upon now in
the farmwork that was so dear to him. But he felt that he was full of the
most splendid plans and projects. First of all he went to the cattle. The
cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides were already
glossy with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked in the sunshine
and lowed to go to the meadow. Levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew
so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition, and gave orders
for them to be driven out into the meadow, and the calves to be let into
the paddock. The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow. The cowherd
girls, picking up their petticoats, ran splashing through the mud with
bare legs, still white, not yet brown from the sun, waving brushwood in
their hands, chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.

<P>&nbsp;After admiring the increase of that year, which were particularly
fine - the early calves were the size of a peasant's cow, and Pava's daughter,
at three months old, was as big as a yearling - Levin gave orders for a
trough to be brought out and hay to be put in the racks. But it appeared
that, since the paddock had not been used during the winter, the racks
made in the autumn were broken. He sent for the carpenter, who, according
to his orders, ought to have been at work at the threshing machine. But
it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which ought to
have been repaired before Lent. This was very annoying to Levin. It was
annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farmwork against
which he had been striving with all his might for so many years. The racks,
as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the
cart horses' stable, and there broken, as they were of light construction,
only meant for foddering calves. Moreover, it was apparent also that the
harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had directed to be
looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very purpose he had hired
three carpenters, had not been put into repair, and the harrows were being
repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field. Levin sent for
his bailiff, but immediately went off himself to look for him. The bailiff,
beaming all over, like everything that day, in a sheepskin bordered with
astrakhan, came out of the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.

<P>&nbsp;`Why isn't the carpenter at the threshing machine?'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing.
Here it's time they got to work in the fields.'

<P>&nbsp;`But what were they doing in the winter, then?'

<P>&nbsp;`But what did you want the carpenter for?'

<P>&nbsp;`Where are the racks for the calves' paddock?'

<P>&nbsp;`I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those
people!' said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.

<P>&nbsp;`It's not those people but this bailiff!' said Levin, getting
angry. `Why, what do I keep you for?' he cried. But, bethinking himself
that this would not help matters, he stopped short in the middle of a sentence,
and merely sighed. `Well, what do you say? Can sowing begin?' he asked,
after a pause.

<P>&nbsp;`Behind Turkino, tomorrow or next day, they might begin.'

<P>&nbsp;`And the clover?'

<P>&nbsp;`I've sent Vassilii and Mishka; they're sowing it. Only I don't
know if they'll manage to get through; it's so slushy.'

<P>&nbsp;`How many dessiatinas?

<P>&nbsp;`Six.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why not sow all?' cried Levin.

<P>&nbsp;That they were only sowing the clover on six dessiatinas, not
in all the twenty, was still more annoying to him. Clover, as he knew,
both from books and from his own experience, never did well except when
it was sown as early as possible, almost in the snow. And yet Levin could
never get this done.

<P>&nbsp;`There's no one to send. What would you do with such people? Three
haven't turned up. And there's Semion...'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, you should have taken some men from the chaffcutter.'

<P>&nbsp;`And so I have, as it is.'

<P>&nbsp;`Where are the peasants, then?'

<P>&nbsp;`Five are making compote' (which meant compost), `and four are
shifting the oats for fear of being touched, Konstantin Dmitrich.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin knew very well that `touching' meant that his English seed
oats were already spoiled. Again they had not done as he had ordered.

<P>&nbsp;`Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,' he cried.

<P>&nbsp;`Don't be put out; we shall get it all done in time.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin made an angry gesture, and went into the granary to glance
at the oats, and then to the stable. The oats were not yet spoiled. But
the laborers were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let
them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be done,
and taking two laborers from there for sowing clover, Levin got over the
vexation his bailiff had caused him. Indeed, it was such a lovely day that
one could not be angry.

<P>&nbsp;`Ignat!' he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked
up, was washing the carriage wheels, `saddle...'

<P>&nbsp;`Which, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, let it be Kolpik.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called the bailiff,
who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began talking
to him about the spring operations before them, and his plans for the farming.

<P>&nbsp;The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get
all done before the early mowing. And the plowing of the outlying land
was to go on without a break, so as to let it lie black fallow and furrowed.
And the moving to be all done by hired labor, not on half-profits.

<P>&nbsp;The bailiff listened attentively, and obviously made an effort
to approve of his employer's projects. But still he had that look Levin
knew so well that always irritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency.
That look said: `That's all very well, but as God wills.'

<P>&nbsp;Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the tone
common to all the bailiffs he had ever had. They had all taken that attitude
to his plans, and so now he was not angered by it, but mortified, and felt
all the more roused to struggle against this apparently elemental force
continually ranged against him, for which he could find no other name than
`as God wills.'

<P>&nbsp;`If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrich,' said the bailiff.

<P>&nbsp;`Why shouldn't you manage it?'

<P>&nbsp;`We positively must have fifteen laborers more. And they don't
turn up. There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin was silent. Again he was brought face to face with that
opposing force. He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire
more than forty - thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight - laborers for a
reasonable sum; some forty had been taken on, and there were no more. But
still he could not help struggling against it.

<P>&nbsp;`Send to Sury, to Chefirovka, if they don't come. We must look
for them.'

<P>&nbsp;`I'll send, to be sure,' said Vassilii Fiodorovich despondently.
`But then there are the horses - they're not good for much.'

<P>&nbsp;`We'll get some more. I know, of course,' Levin added laughing,
`you always want to do with as little and as poor a quality as possible;
but this year I'm not going to let you have things your own way. I'll see
to everything myself.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why, I don't think you take much rest as it is. It cheers us
up to work under the master's eye....'

<P>&nbsp;`So they're sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I'll go and have
a look at them,' he said, mounting the little bay cob, Kolpik, who was
led up by the coachman.

<P>&nbsp;`You can't get across the stream, Konstantin Dmitrich,' the coachman
shouted.

<P>&nbsp;`All right, I'll go by the forest.'

<P>&nbsp;And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and
out into the open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity,
ambling easily, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were, for guidance.

<P>&nbsp;If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard,
he felt happier yet in the open country. Swaying rhythmically with the
ambling paces of his good little cob, drinking in the warm yet fresh scent
of the snow and the air, as he rode through his forest over the crumbling,
wasted snow, still left in parts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he
rejoiced over every tree, with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds
swelling on its shoots. When he came out of the forest, in the immense
plain before him, his winter fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of
green, without one bare place or swamp, only spotted here and there in
the hollows with patches of melting snow. He was not put out of temper
even by the sight of the peasants' horse and colt trampling down his young
grass (he told a peasant he met to drive them out), nor by the sarcastic
and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and asked,
`Well, Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?' `We must get the plowing done first,
Konstantin Dmitrich,' answered Ipat. The farther he rode, the happier he
became, and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last:
to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders, so that
the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up into six fields of
tillage and three for pasture and hay; to build a cattle yard at the further
end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for
the cattle as a means of manuring the land. And then three hundred dessiatinas
of wheat, one hundred of potatoes, and one hundred and fifty of clover,
and not a dessiatina exhausted.

<P>&nbsp;Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges
so as not to trample his young winter fields, he rode up to the laborers
who had been sent to sow clover. A telega with the seed in it was standing,
not at the edge, but in the middle of the tillage, and the winter corn
had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse. Both the laborers
were sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe, turn and turn about.
The earth in the telega, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed
to powder, but crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing the master,
the laborer, Vassilii, went toward the telega, while Mishka set to work
sowing. This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom
lost his temper. When Vassilii came up, Levin told him to lead the horse
to the hedge.

<P>&nbsp;`Never mind, sir, it'll spring up again,' responded Vassilii.

<P>&nbsp;`Please don't argue,' said Levin, `but do as you're told.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, sir,' answered Vassilii, and he took the horse's head. `What
a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrich!' he said ingratiatingly. `First-rate. Only
it's a work to get about! A fellow drags thirty pounds of earth at every
step.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?' said Levin.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, we crumble it up,' answered Vassilii, taking up some seed
and rolling the earth in his palms.

<P>&nbsp;Vassilii was not to blame for their having fired up his telega
with unsifted earth, but still it was annoying.

<P>&nbsp;Levin had already, more than once, tried a way he knew for stifling
his anger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that
way now. He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of
earth that clung to each foot; and, getting off his horse, he took the
sieve from Vassilii and started sowing himself.

<P>&nbsp;`Where did you stop?'

<P>&nbsp;Vassilii pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward
as best he could, scattering the seed on the land. Walking was as difficult
as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he was in a great
heat, and, stopping, gave the sieve over to Vassilii.

<P>&nbsp;`Well master, when summer's here, mind you don't scold me for
this row,' said Vassilii.

<P>&nbsp;`Eh?' said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his method.

<P>&nbsp;`Why, you'll see in the summertime. It'll look different. Look
you where I sowed last spring. How I did work at it I do my best, Konstantin
Dmitrich, d'ye see, as I would for my own father. I don't like botchwork
myself, nor would I let another man do it. What's good for the master is
good for us too. It does one's heart good,' said Vassilii, pointing, `to
look over yonder.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's a lovely spring, Vassilii.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why, it's a spring such as even the old men don't remember the
like of. I was up home; my father there has sown wheat too, three osminas
of it. He was saying you couldn't tell it from rye.'

<P>&nbsp;`Have you been sowing wheat long?'

<P>&nbsp;`Why, sir, it was you taught us, the year before last. You gave
me two measures. We sold about one chetvert and sowed three osminas.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, mind you crumble up the clods,' said Levin, going toward
his horse, `and keep an eye on Mishka. And if there's a good crop you shall
have half a rouble for every dessiatina.'

<P>&nbsp;`Thank you, kindly. We are very well content, sir, with your treatment,
as it is.'

<P>&nbsp;Levin got on his horse and rode toward the field where last year's
clover was, and the one which was plowed ready for the spring corn.

<P>&nbsp;The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. It
had revived already, and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks
of last year's wheat. The horse sank in up to the pasterns, and he drew
each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground. Over the
plowland the riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only keep a
foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing furrows he sank in deep
at each step. The plowland was in splendid condition; in a couple of days
it would be fit for harrowing and sowing. Everything was capital, everything
was cheering. Levin rode back across the streams, hoping the water would
have gone down. And he did in fact get across, and startled two ducks.
`There must be woodcock here too,' he thought, and just as he reached the
turning homewards he met the forest keeper, who confirmed his theory about
the woodcock.

<P>&nbsp;Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner
and get his gun ready for the evening.
