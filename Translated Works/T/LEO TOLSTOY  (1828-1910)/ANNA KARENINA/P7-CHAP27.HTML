Chapter 27</H2>
`He has gone! It is the end!' Anna said to herself, standing at the window;
and in answer to this question the impression of the darkness when the
candle had flickered out and of her fearful dream, mingling into one, filled
her heart with cold terror.

<P>&nbsp;`No, that cannot be!' she cried, and crossing the room she rang
the bell. She was afraid now of being alone, that, without waiting for
the servant to come in, she went out to meet him.

<P>&nbsp;`Inquire where the Count has gone,' she said.

<P>&nbsp;The servant answered that the Count had gone to the stable.

<P>&nbsp;`His Honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage
would be back immediately.'

<P>&nbsp;`Very good. Wait a minute. I'll write a note at once. Send Mikhail
with the note to the stables. Make haste.'

<P>&nbsp;She sat down and wrote:

<P>&nbsp;`I was wrong. Come back home; I must explain. For God's sake come!
I'm afraid.'

<P>&nbsp;She sealed it up and gave it to the servant.

<P>&nbsp;She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant
out of the room, and went to the nursery.

<P>&nbsp;`Why, this isn't it - this isn't he! Where are his blue eyes,
his sweet, shy smile?' was her first thought when she saw her chubby, rosy
little girl, with her black, curly hair, instead of Seriozha, whom in the
tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery. The little
girl sitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it
with a cork, and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitch-black eyes.
Answering the English nurse that she was quite well, and that she was going
to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and began spinning
the cork to show her. But the child's loud, ringing laugh, and the motion
of her eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly that she got up hurriedly,
restraining her sobs, and went away. `Can it be all over? No, it cannot
be!' she thought. `He will come back. But how can he explain that smile,
that excitement after he had been talking to her? But even if he doesn't
explain, I will believe. If I don't believe, there's only one thing left
for me... and I can't do it.'

<P>&nbsp;She looked at her watch. Twenty minutes had passed. `By now he
has received the note and is coming back. Not long, ten minutes more....
But what if he doesn't come? No, that cannot be. He mustn't see me with
tear-stained eyes. I'll go and wash. Yes, yes; did I do my hair or not?'
she asked herself. And she could not remember. She felt her head with her
hand. `Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can't in the least
remember.' She could not believe the evidence of her hand, and went up
to the pier glass to see whether she really had done her hair. She certainly
had, but she could not think when she had done it. `Who's that?' she thought,
looking in the looking glass at the swollen face with strangely glittering
eyes, that looked in a scared way at her. `Why, it's I!' she suddenly understood,
and, looking round, she seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and
twitched her shoulders, shuddering. Then she lifted her hand to her lips
and kissed it.

<P>&nbsp;`What is it? Why, I'm going out of my mind!' And she went into
her bedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.

<P>&nbsp;`Annushka,' she said, coming to a standstill before her, and she
stared at the maid, not knowing what to say to her.

<P>&nbsp;`You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,' said the maid, as
though she understood.

<P>&nbsp;`Darya Alexandrovna? Yes, I'll go.'

<P>&nbsp;`Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back. He's coming, he'll
be here soon.' She took out her watch and looked at it. `But how could
he go away, leaving me in such a state? How can he live, without making
it up with me?' She went to the window and began looking into the street.
Judging by the time, he might be back now. But her calculations might be
wrong, and she began once more to recall when he had started and to count
the minutes.

<P>&nbsp;At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare
it with her watch, someone drove up. Glancing out of the window, she saw
his carriage. But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard below.
It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage. She went down to
him.

<P>&nbsp;`We didn't catch the Count. The Count had driven off on the Nizhny-Novgorod
line.'

<P>&nbsp;`What do you say? What!...' she said to the rosy, good-humored
Mikhail, as he handed her back her note.

<P>&nbsp;`Why, then, he has never received it!' she thought.

<P>&nbsp;`Go with this note to Countess Vronsky's place in the country
- do you know where it is? And bring an answer back immediately,' she said
to the messenger.

<P>&nbsp;`And I - what am I going to do?' she thought. `Yes, I'm going
to Dolly's - that's best, or else I shall go out of my mind. Yes, and I
can telegraph, too.' And she wrote a telegram:

<P>&nbsp;`<I>I absolutely must talk to you; come at once</I>.'

<P>&nbsp;After sending off the telegram, she went to dress. When she was
dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of the plump, comfortable-looking
Annushka. There was unmistakable sympathy in those good-natured little
gray eyes.

<P>&nbsp;`Annushka, dear, what am I to do?' said Anna, sobbing and sinking
helplessly into a chair.

<P>&nbsp;`Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna? Why, there's nothing out
of the way. You drive out a little, and it'll cheer you up,' said the maid.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, I'm going,' said Anna, rousing herself and getting up. `And
if there's a telegram while I'm away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna's....
But no, I shall be back myself.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, I mustn't think; I must do something, drive somewhere, and,
most of all, get out of this house,' she said, feeling with terror the
strange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste to go out,
and get into the carriage.

<P>&nbsp;`Where to?' asked Piotr before getting on the box.

<P>&nbsp;`The Znamenka - the Oblonskys'.'
