"Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a

tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not

evil."--ST. MATTHEW V. 38, 39.






It was in the time of serfdom--many years before Alexander II.'s

liberation of the sixty million serfs in 1862.  In those days the

people were ruled by different kinds of lords.  There were not a

few who, remembering God, treated their slaves in a humane

manner, and not as beasts of burden, while there were others who

were seldom known to perform a kind or generous action; but the

most barbarous and tyrannical of all were those former serfs who

arose from the dirt and became princes.



It was this latter class who made life literally a burden to

those who were unfortunate enough to come under their rule.  Many

of them had arisen from the ranks of the peasantry to become

superintendents of noblemen's estates.



The peasants were obliged to work for their master a certain

number of days each week.  There was plenty of land and water and

the soil was rich and fertile, while the meadows and forests were

sufficient to supply the needs of both the peasants and their

lord.



There was a certain nobleman who had chosen a superintendent from

the peasantry on one of his other estates.  No sooner had the

power to govern been vested in this newly-made official than he

began to practice the most outrageous cruelties upon the poor

serfs who had been placed under his control.  Although this man

had a wife and two married daughters, and was making so much

money that he could have lived happily without transgressing in

any way against either God or man, yet he was filled with envy

and jealousy and deeply sunk in sin.



Michael Simeonovitch began his persecutions by compelling the

peasants to perform more days of service on the estate every week

than the laws obliged them to work.  He established a brick-yard,

in which he forced the men and women to do excessive labor,

selling the bricks for his own profit.



On one occasion the overworked serfs sent a delegation to Moscow

to complain of their treatment to their lord, but they obtained

no satisfaction.  When the poor peasants returned disconsolate

from the nobleman their superintendent determined to have revenge

for their boldness in going above him for redress, and their life

and that of their fellow-victims became worse than before.



It happened that among the serfs there were some very treacherous

people who would falsely accuse their fellows of wrong-doing and

sow seeds of discord among the peasantry, whereupon Michael would

become greatly enraged, while his poor subjects began to live in

fear of their lives.  When the superintendent passed through the

village the people would run and hide themselves as from a wild

beast.  Seeing thus the terror which he had struck to the hearts

of the moujiks, Michael's treatment of them became still more

vindictive, so that from over-work and ill-usage the lot of the

poor serfs was indeed a hard one.



There was a time when it was possible for the peasants, when

driven to despair, to devise means whereby they could rid

themselves of an inhuman monster such as Simeonovitch, and so

these unfortunate people began to consider whether something

could not be done to relieve THEM of their intolerable yoke. 

They would hold little meetings in secret places to bewail their

misery and to confer with one another as to which would be the

best way to act.  Now and then the boldest of the gathering

would rise and address his companions in this strain: "How much

longer can we tolerate such a villain to rule over us?  Let us

make an end of it at once, for it were better for us to perish

than to suffer.  It is surely not a sin to kill such a devil in

human form."



It happened once, before the Easter holidays, that one of these

meetings was held in the woods, where Michael had sent the serfs

to make a clearance for their master.  At noon they assembled to

eat their dinner and to hold a consultation.  "Why can't we leave

now?" said one.  "Very soon we shall be reduced to nothing. 

Already we are almost worked to death--there being no rest, night

or day, either for us or our poor women.  If anything should be

done in a way not exactly to please him he will find fault and

perhaps flog some of us to death--as was the case with poor

Simeon, whom he killed not long ago.  Only recently Anisim was

tortured in irons till he died.  We certainly cannot stand this

much longer."  "Yes," said another, "what is the use of waiting? 

Let us act at once.  Michael will be here this evening, and will

be certain to abuse us shamefully.  Let us, then, thrust him from

his horse and with one blow of an axe give him what he deserves,

and thus end our misery.  We can then dig a big hole and bury him

like a dog, and no one will know what became of him.  Now let us

come to an agreement--to stand together as one man and not to

betray one another."



The last speaker was Vasili Minayeff, who, if possible, had more

cause to complain of Michael's cruelty than any of his

fellow-serfs.  The superintendent was in the habit of flogging

him severely every week, and he took also Vasili's wife to serve

him as cook.



Accordingly, during the evening that followed this meeting in the

woods Michael arrived on the scene on horseback.  He began at

once to find fault with the manner in which the work had been

done, and to complain because some lime-trees had been cut down.



"I told you not to cut down any lime-trees!" shouted the enraged

superintendent.  "Who did this thing?  Tell me at once, or I

shall flog every one of you!"



On investigation, a peasant named Sidor was pointed out as the

guilty one, and his face was roundly slapped.  Michael also

severely punished Vasili, because he had not done sufficient

work, after which the master rode safely home.



In the evening the serfs again assembled, and poor Vasili said:

"Oh, what kind of people ARE we, anyway?  We are only sparrows,

and not men at all!  We agree to stand by each other, but as soon

as the time for action comes we all run and hide.  Once a lot of

sparrows conspired against a hawk, but no sooner did the bird of

prey appear than they sneaked off in the grass.  Selecting one of

the choicest sparrows, the hawk took it away to eat, after which

the others came out crying, 'Twee-twee!' and found that one was

missing.  'Who is killed?' they asked.  'Vanka!  Well, he

deserved it.'  You, my friends, are acting in just the same

manner.  When Michael attacked Sidor you should have stood by

your promise.  Why didn't you arise, and with one stroke put an

end to him and to our misery?"



The effect of this speech was to make the peasants more firm in

their determination to kill their superintendent.  The latter had

already given orders that they should be ready to plough during

the Easter holidays, and to sow the field with oats, whereupon

the serfs became stricken with grief, and gathered in Vasili's

house to hold another indignation meeting.  "If he has really

forgotten God," they said, "and shall continue to commit such

crimes against us, it is truly necessary that we should kill him. 

If not, let us perish, for it can make no difference to us now."



This despairing programme, however, met with considerable

opposition from a peaceably-inclined man named Peter Mikhayeff. 

"Brethren," said he, "you are contemplating a grievous sin.  The

taking of human life is a very serious matter.  Of course it is

easy to end the mortal existence of a man, but what will become

of the souls of those who commit the deed?  If Michael continues

to act toward us unjustly God will surely punish him.  But, my

friends, we must have patience."



This pacific utterance only served to intensify the anger of

Vasili.  Said he: "Peter is forever repeating the same old story,

'It is a sin to kill any one.'  Certainly it is sinful to murder;

but we should consider the kind of man we are dealing with.  We

all know it is wrong to kill a good man, but even God would take

away the life of such a dog as he is.  It is our duty, if we have

any love for mankind, to shoot a dog that is mad.  It is a sin to

let him live. If, therefore, we are to suffer at all, let it be

in the interests of the people--and they will thank us for it. 

If we remain quiet any longer a flogging will be our only reward. 

You are talking nonsense, Mikhayeff.  Why don't you think of the

sin we shall be committing if we work during the Easter

holidays--for you will refuse to work then yourself?"



"Well, then," replied Peter, "if they shall send me to plough, I

will go.  But I shall not be going of my own free will, and God

will know whose sin it is, and shall punish the offender

accordingly.  Yet we must not forget him. Brethren, I am not

giving you my own views only.  The law of God is not to return

evil for evil; indeed, if you try in this way to stamp out

wickedness it will come upon you all the stronger.  It is not

difficult for you to kill the man, but his blood will surely

stain your own soul.  You may think you have killed a bad

man--that you have gotten rid of evil--but you will soon find out

that the seeds of still greater wickedness have been planted

within you.  If you yield to misfortune it will surely come to

you."



As Peter was not without sympathizers among the peasants, the

poor serfs were consequently divided into two groups: the

followers of Vasili and those who held the views of Mikhayeff.



On Easter Sunday no work was done.  Toward the evening an elder

came to the peasants from the nobleman's court and said: "Our

superintendent, Michael Simeonovitch, orders you to go to-morrow

to plough the field for the oats." Thus the official went through

the village and directed the men to prepare for work the next

day--some by the river and others by the roadway.  The poor

people were almost overcome with grief, many of them shedding

tears, but none dared to disobey the orders of their master.



On the morning of Easter Monday, while the church bells were

calling the inhabitants to religious services, and while every

one else was about to enjoy a holiday, the unfortunate serfs

started for the field to plough.  Michael arose rather late and

took a walk about the farm. The domestic servants were through

with their work and had dressed themselves for the day, while

Michael's wife and their widowed daughter (who was visiting them,

as was her custom on holidays) had been to church and returned. 

A steaming samovar awaited them, and they  began to drink tea

with Michael, who, after lighting his pipe, called the elder to

him.



"Well," said the superintendent, "have you ordered the moujiks to

plough to-day?"



"Yes, sir, I did," was the reply.



"Have they all gone to the field?"



"Yes, sir; all of them.  I directed them myself where to begin."



"That is all very well.  You gave the orders, but are they

ploughing?  Go at once and see, and you may tell them that I

shall be there after dinner.  I shall expect to find one and a

half acres done for every two ploughs, and the work must be well

done; otherwise they shall be severely punished, notwithstanding

the holiday."



"I hear, sir, and obey."



The elder started to go, but Michael called him back.  After

hesitating for some time, as if he felt very uneasy, he said:



"By the way, listen to what those scoundrels say about me. 

Doubtless some of them will curse me, and I want you to report

the exact words.  I know what villains they are.  They don't find

work at all pleasant.  They would rather lie down all day and do

nothing.  They would like to eat and drink and make merry on

holidays, but they forget that if the ploughing is not done it

will soon be too late.  So you go and listen to what is said, and

tell it to me in detail.  Go at once."



"I hear, sir, and obey."



Turning his back and mounting his horse, the elder was soon at

the field where the serfs were hard at work.



It happened that Michael's wife, a very good-hearted woman,

overheard the conversation which her husband had just been

holding with the elder.  Approaching him, she said:



"My good friend, Mishinka [diminutive of Michael], I beg of you

to consider the importance and solemnity of this holy-day.  Do

not sin, for Christ's sake.  Let the poor moujiks go home."



Michael laughed, but made no reply to his wife's humane request. 

Finally he said to her:



"You've not been whipped for a very long time, and now you have

become bold enough to interfere in affairs that are not your

own."



"Mishinka," she persisted, "I have had a frightful dream

concerning you.  You had better let the moujiks go."



"Yes," said he; "I perceive that you have gained so much flesh of

late that you think you would not feel the whip.  Lookout!"



Rudely thrusting his hot pipe against her cheek, Michael chased

his wife from the room, after which he ordered his dinner.  After

eating a hearty meal consisting of cabbage-soup, roast pig,

meat-cake, pastry with milk, jelly, sweet cakes, and vodki, he

called his woman cook to him and ordered her to be seated and

sing songs, Simeonovitch accompanying her on the guitar.



While the superintendent was thus enjoying himself to the fullest

satisfaction in the musical society of his cook the elder

returned, and, making a low bow to his superior, proceeded to

give the desired information concerning the serfs.



"Well," asked Michael, "did they plough?"



"Yes," replied the elder; "they have accomplished about half the

field."



"Is there no fault to be found?"



"Not that I could discover.  The work seems to be well done. 

They are evidently afraid of you."



"How is the soil?"



"Very good.  It appears to be quite soft."



"Well," said Simeonovitch, after a pause, "what did they say

about me?  Cursed me, I suppose?"



As the elder hesitated somewhat, Michael commanded him to speak

and tell him the whole truth.  "Tell me all," said he; "I want to

know their exact words.  If you tell me the truth I shall reward

you; but if you conceal anything from me you will be punished. 

See here, Catherine, pour out a glass of vodki to give him

courage!"



After drinking to the health of his superior, the elder said to

himself: "It is not my fault if they do not praise him.  I shall

tell him the truth."  Then turning suddenly to the superintendent

he said:



"They complain, Michael Simeonovitch! They complain bitterly."



"But what did they say?" demanded Michael. "Tell me!"



"Well, one thing they said was, 'He does not believe in God.'"



Michael laughed.  "Who said that?" he asked.



"It seemed to be their unanimous opinion. 'He has been overcome

by the Evil One,' they said."



"Very good," laughed the superintendent; "but tell me what each

of them said.  What did Vasili say?"



The elder did not wish to betray his people, but he had a certain

grudge against Vasili, and he said:



"He cursed you more than did any of the others."



"But what did he say?"



"It is awful to repeat it, sir.  Vasili said, 'He shall die like

a dog, having no chance to repent!'"



"Oh, the villain!" exclaimed Michael.  "He would kill me if he

were not afraid.  All right, Vasili; we shall have an accounting

with you. And Tishka--he called me a dog, I suppose?"



"Well," said the elder, "they all spoke of you in anything but

complimentary terms; but it is mean in me to repeat what they

said."



"Mean or not you must tell me, I say!"



"Some of them declared that your back should be

broken."



Simeonovitch appeared to enjoy this immensely, for he laughed

outright.  "We shall see whose back will be the first to be

broken," said he. "Was that Tishka's opinion?  While I did not

suppose they would say anything good about me, I did not expect

such curses and threats. And Peter Mikhayeff--was that fool

cursing me too?"



"No; he did not curse you at all.  He appeared to be the only

silent one among them.  Mikhayeff is a very wise moujik, and he

surprises me very much.  At his actions all the other peasants

seemed amazed."



"What did he do?"



"He did something remarkable.  He was diligently ploughing, and

as I approached him I heard some one singing very sweetly. 

Looking between the ploughshares, I observed a bright object

shining."



"Well, what was it?  Hurry up!"



"It was a small, five-kopeck wax candle, burning brightly, and

the wind was unable to blow it out.  Peter, wearing a new shirt,

sang beautiful hymns as he ploughed, and no matter how he handled

the implement the candle continued to burn.  In my presence he

fixed the plough, shaking it violently, but the bright little

object between the colters remained undisturbed."



"And what did Mikhayeff say?"



"He said nothing--except when, on seeing me, he gave me the

holy-day salutation, after which he went on his way singing and

ploughing as before.  I did not say anything to him, but, on

approaching the other moujiks, I found that they were laughing

and making sport of their silent companion.  'It is a great sin

to plough on Easter Monday,' they said.  'You could not get

absolution from your sin if you were to pray all your life.'"



"And did Mikhayeff make no reply?"



"He stood long enough to say: 'There should be peace on earth and

good-will to men,' after which he resumed his ploughing and

singing, the candle burning even more brightly than

before."



Simeonovitch had now ceased to ridicule, and, putting aside his

guitar, his head dropped on his breast and he became lost in

thought.  Presently he ordered the elder and cook to depart,

after which Michael went behind a screen and threw himself upon

the bed.  He was sighing and moaning, as if in great distress,

when his wife came in and spoke kindly to him.  He refused to

listen to her, exclaiming:



"He has conquered me, and my end is near!"



"Mishinka," said the woman, "arise and go to the moujiks in the

field.  Let them go home, and everything will be all right. 

Heretofore you have run far greater risks without any fear, but

now you appear to be very much alarmed."



"He has conquered me!" he repeated.  "I am lost!"



"What do you mean?" demanded his wife, angrily.  "If you will go

and do as I tell you there will be no danger.  Come, Mishinka,"

she added, tenderly; "I shall have the saddle-horse brought for

you at once."



When the horse arrived the woman persuaded her husband to mount

the animal, and to fulfil her request concerning the serfs.  When

he reached the village a woman opened the gate for him to enter,

and as he did so the inhabitants, seeing the brutal

superintendent whom everybody feared, ran to hide themselves in

their houses, gardens, and other secluded places.



At length Michael reached the other gate, which he found closed

also, and, being unable to open it himself while seated on his

horse, he called loudly for assistance.  As no one responded to

his shouts he dismounted and opened the gate, but as he was about

to remount, and had one foot in the stirrup, the horse became

frightened at some pigs and sprang suddenly to one side.  The

superintendent fell across the fence and a very sharp picket

pierced his stomach, when Michael fell unconscious to the ground.



Toward the evening, when the serfs arrived at the village gate,

their horses refused to enter.  On looking around, the peasants

discovered the dead body of their superintendent lying face

downward in a pool of blood, where he had fallen from the fence. 

Peter Mikhayeff alone had sufficient courage to dismount and

approach the prostrate form, his companions riding around the

village and entering by way of the back yards.  Peter closed the

dead man's eyes, after which he put the body in a wagon and took

it home.



When the nobleman learned of the fatal accident which had

befallen his superintendent, and of the brutal treatment which he

had meted out to those under him, he freed the serfs, exacting a

small rent for the use of his land and the other agricultural

opportunities.



And thus the peasants clearly understood that the power of God is

manifested not in evil, but in goodness.
