"--AND you say that a man cannot, of himself,
understand what is good and evil; that it is all
environment, that the environment swamps the
man.  But I believe it is all chance.  Take my
own case . . ."

Thus spoke our excellent friend, Ivan Vasilie-
vich, after a conversation between us on the impos-
sibility of improving individual character without
a change of the conditions under which men live. 
Nobody had actually said that one could not of
oneself understand good and evil; but it was a
habit of Ivan Vasilievich to answer in this way the
thoughts aroused in his own mind by conversation,
and to illustrate those thoughts by relating inci-
dents in his own life.  He often quite forgot the
reason for his story in telling it; but he always told
it with great sincerity and feeling.

He did so now.

"Take my own case.  My whole life was
moulded, not by environment, but by something
quite different."

"By what, then?" we asked.

"Oh, that is a long story.  I should have to
tell you about a great many things to make you
understand."

"Well, tell us then."

Ivan Vasilievich thought a little, and shook his
head.

"My whole life," he said, "was changed in one
night, or, rather, morning."

"Why, what happened?" one of us asked.

"What happened was that I was very much in
love.  I have been in love many times, but this
was the most serious of all.  It is a thing of the
past; she has married daughters now.  It was
Varinka B---- "  Ivan Vasilievich mentioned her
surname.  "Even at fifty she is remarkably hand-
some; but in her youth, at eighteen, she was ex-
quisite--tall, slender, graceful, and stately.  Yes,
stately is the word; she held herself very erect, by
instinct as it were; and carried her head high, and
that together with her beauty and height gave her
a queenly air in spite of being thin, even bony one
might say.  It might indeed have been deterring
had it not been for her smile, which was always
gay and cordial, and for the charming light in
her eyes and for her youthful sweetness."

"What an entrancing description you give, Ivan
Vasilievich!"

"Description, indeed! I could not possibly de-
scribe her so that you could appreciate her.  But
that does not matter; what I am going to tell you
happened in the forties.  I was at that time a
student in a provincial university.  I don't know
whether it was a good thing or no, but we had no
political clubs, no theories in our universities then. 
We were simply young and spent our time as young
men do, studying and amusing ourselves.  I was a
very gay, lively, careless fellow, and had plenty of
money too.  I had a fine horse, and used to go
tobogganing with the young ladies.  Skating had
not yet come into fashion.  I went to drinking
parties with my comrades--in those days we
drank nothing but champagne--if we had no
champagne we drank nothing at all.  We never
drank vodka, as they do now.  Evening parties
and balls were my favourite amusements.  I
danced well, and was not an ugly fellow."

"Come, there is no need to be modest," inter-
rupted a lady near him.  "We have seen your
photograph.  Not ugly, indeed! You were a
handsome fellow."

"Handsome, if you like.  That does not mat-
ter.  When my love for her was at its strongest,
on the last day of the carnival, I was at a ball at
the provincial marshal's, a good-natured old man,
rich and hospitable, and a court chamberlain.  The
guests were welcomed by his wife, who was as
good-natured as himself.  She was dressed in
puce-coloured velvet, and had a diamond diadem
on her forehead, and her plump, old white shoul-
ders and bosom were bare like the portraits of
Empress Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the
Great.

"It was a delightful ball.  It was a splendid
room, with a gallery for the orchestra, which was
famous at the time, and consisted of serfs belong-
ing to a musical landowner.  The refreshments
were magnificent, and the champagne flowed in
rivers.  Though I was fond of champagne I did
not drink that night, because without it I was
drunk with love.  But I made up for it by danc-
ing waltzes and polkas till I was ready to drop--
of course, whenever possible, with Varinka.  She
wore a white dress with a pink sash, white shoes,
and white kid gloves, which did not quite reach to
her thin pointed elbows.  A disgusting engineer
named Anisimov robbed me of the mazurka with
her--to this day I cannot forgive him.  He asked
her for the dance the minute she arrived, while
I had driven to the hair-dresser's to get a pair of
gloves, and was late.  So I did not dance the
mazurka with her, but with a German girl to whom
I had previously paid a little attention; but I am
afraid I did not behave very politely to her that
evening.  I hardly spoke or looked at her, and saw
nothing but the tall, slender figure in a white dress,
with a pink sash, a flushed, beaming, dimpled
face, and sweet, kind eyes.  I was not alone; they
were all looking at her with admiration, the men
and women alike, although she outshone all of
them.  They could not help admiring her.

"Although I was not nominally her partner for
the mazurka, I did as a matter of fact dance nearly
the whole time with her.  She always came for-
ward boldly the whole length of the room to pick
me out.  I flew to meet her without waiting to be
chosen, and she thanked me with a smile for my
intuition.  When I was brought up to her with
somebody else, and she guessed wrongly, she took
the other man's hand with a shrug of her slim
shoulders, and smiled at me regretfully.

"Whenever there was a waltz figure in the
mazurka, I waltzed with her for a long time, and
breathing fast and smiling, she would say, 'En-
core'; and I went on waltzing and waltzing, as
though unconscious of any bodily existence."

"Come now, how could you be unconscious of
it with your arm round her waist? You must
have been conscious, not only of your own exist-
ence, but of hers," said one of the party.

Ivan Vasilievich cried out, almost shouting in
anger:  " There you are, moderns all over! Now-
adays you think of nothing but the body.  It was
different in our day.  The more I was in love the
less corporeal was she in my eyes.  Nowadays you
think of nothing but the body.  It was different
in our day.  The more I was in love the less cor-
poreal was she in my eyes.  Nowadays you set
legs, ankles, and I don't know what.  You undress
the women you are in love with.  In my eyes, as
Alphonse Karr said--and he was a good writer
--'the one I loved was always draped in robes of
bronze.' We never thought of doing so; we tried
to veil her nakedness, like Noah's good-natured
son.  Oh, well, you can't understand."

"Don't pay any attention to him.  Go on," said
one of them.

"Well, I danced for the most part with her,
and did not notice how time was passing.  The
musicians kept playing the same mazurka tunes
over and over again in desperate exhaustion--you
know what it is towards the end of a ball.  Papas
and mammas were already getting up from the
card-tables in the drawing-room in expectation of
supper, the men-servants were running to and
fro bringing in things.  It was nearly three
o'clock.  I had to make the most of the last
minutes.  I chose her again for the mazurka, and
for the hundredth time we danced across the
room.

"'The quadrille after supper is mine,' I said,
taking her to her place.

"'Of course, if I am not carried off home,' she
said, with a smile.

"'I won't give you up,' I said.

"'Give me my fan, anyhow,' she answered.

"'I am so sorry to part with it,' I said, handing
her a cheap white fan.

"'Well, here's something to console you,' she
said, plucking a feather out of the fan, and giving
it to me.

"I took the feather, and could only express my
rapture and gratitude with my eyes.  I was not
only pleased and gay, I was happy, delighted; I
was good, I was not myself but some being not
of this earth, knowing nothing of evil.  I hid the
feather in my glove, and stood there unable to
tear myself away from her.

"'Look, they are urging father to dance,' she
said to me, pointing to the tall, stately figure of
her father, a colonel with silver epaulettes, who
was standing in the doorway with some ladies.

"'Varinka, come here!' exclaimed our hostess,
the lady with the diamond ferronniere and with
shoulders like Elizabeth, in a loud voice.

"'Varinka went to the door, and I followed her. 

"'Persuade your father to dance the mazurka
with you, ma chere.--Do, please, Peter Valdislavo-
vich,' she said, turning to the colonel.

"Varinka's father was a very handsome, well-
preserved old man.  He had a good colour, mous-
taches curled in the style of Nicolas I., and white
whiskers which met the moustaches.  His hair was
combed on to his forehead, and a bright smile,
like his daughter's, was on his lips and in his eyes. 
He was splendidly set up, with a broad military
chest, on which he wore some decorations, and he
had powerful shoulders and long slim legs.  He
was that ultra-military type produced by the disci-
pline of Emperor Nicolas I.

"When we approached the door the colonel was
just refusing to dance, saying that he had quite for-
gotten how; but at that instant he smiled, swung
his arm gracefully around to the left, drew his
sword from its sheath, handed it to an obliging
young man who stood near, and smoothed his
suede glove on his right hand.

"'Everything must be done according to rule,'
he said with a smile.  He took the hand of his
daughter, and stood one-quarter turned, waiting
for the music.

"At the first sound of the mazurka, he stamped
one foot smartly, threw the other forward, and,
at first slowly and smoothly, then buoyantly and
impetuously, with stamping of feet and clicking of
boots, his tall, imposing figure moved the length
of the room.  Varinka swayed gracefully beside
him, rhythmically and easily, making her steps
short or long, with her little feet in their white satin
slippers.

"All the people in the room followed every
movement of the couple.  As for me I not only ad-
mired, I regarded them with enraptured sym-
pathy.  I was particularly impressed with the old
gentleman's boots.  They were not the modern
pointed affairs, but were made of cheap leather,
squared-toed, and evidently built by the regimental
cobbler.  In order that his daughter might dress
and go out in society, he did not buy fashionable
boots, but wore home-made ones, I thought, and
his square toes seemed to me most touching.  It
was obvious that in his time he had been a good
dancer; but now he was too heavy, and his legs had
not spring enough for all the beautiful steps he
tried to take.  Still, he contrived to go twice round
the room.  When at the end, standing with legs
apart, he suddenly clicked his feet together and fell
on one knee, a bit heavily, and she danced grace-
fully around him, smiling and adjusting her skirt,
the whole room applauded.

"Rising with an effort, he tenderly took his
daughter's face between his hands.  He kissed her
on the forehead, and brought her to me, under the
impression that I was her partner for the mazurka. 
I said I was not.  'Well, never mind. just go
around the room once with her,' he said, smil-
ing kindly, as he replaced his sword in the
sheath.

"As the contents of a bottle flow readily when
the first drop has been poured, so my love for
Varinka seemed to set free the whole force of lov-
ing within me.  In surrounding her it embraced the
world.  I loved the hostess with her diadem and
her shoulders like Elizabeth, and her husband and
her guests and her footmen, and even the engineer
Anisimov who felt peevish towards me.  As for
Varinka's father, with his home-made boots and
his kind smile, so like her own, I felt a sort of ten-
derness for him that was almost rapture.

"After supper I danced the promised quadrille
with her, and though I had been infinitely happy
before, I grew still happier every moment.

"We did not speak of love.  I neither asked
myself nor her whether she loved me.  It was
quite enough to know that I loved her.  And I had
only one fear--that something might come to in-
terfere with my great joy.

"When I went home, and began to undress for
the night, I found it quite out of the question.
held the little feather out of her fan in my hand,
and one of her gloves which she gave me when I
helped her into the carriage after her mother. 
Looking at these things, and without closing my
eyes I could see her before me as she was for an
instant when she had to choose between two part-
ners.  She tried to guess what kind of person
was represented in me, and I could hear her
sweet voice as she said, 'Pride--am I right?' and
merrily gave me her hand.  At supper she took the
first sip from my glass of champagne, looking at
me over the rim with her caressing glance.  But,
plainest of all, I could see her as she danced with
her father, gliding along beside him, and looking
at the admiring observers with pride and happi-
ness.

"He and she were united in my mind in one
rush of pathetic tenderness.

"I was living then with my brother, who has
since died.  He disliked going out, and never went
to dances; and besides, he was busy preparing for
his last university examinations, and was leading a
very regular life.  He was asleep.  I looked at
him, his head buried in the pillow and half covered
with the quilt; and I affectionately pitied him,
pitied him for his ignorance of the bliss I was ex-
periencing.  Our serf Petrusha had met me with a
candle, ready to undress me, but I sent him away. 
His sleepy face and tousled hair seemed to me so
touching.  Trying not to make a noise, I went to
my room on tiptoe and sat down on my bed.  No,
I was too happy; I could not sleep.  Besides, it
was too hot in the rooms.  Without taking off my
uniform, I went quietly into the hall, put on my
overcoat, opened the front door and stepped out
into the street.

"It was after four when I had left the ball;
going home and stopping there a while had occu-
pied two hours, so by the time I went out it was
dawn.  It was regular carnival weather--foggy,
and the road full of water-soaked snow just melt-
ing, and water dripping from the eaves.  Varin-
ka's family lived on the edge of town near a large
field, one end of which was a parade ground:  at
the other end was a boarding-school for young
ladies.  I passed through our empty little street
and came to the main thoroughfare, where I met
pedestrians and sledges laden with wood, the run-
ners grating the road.  The horses swung with
regular paces beneath their shining yokes, their
backs covered with straw mats and their heads wet
with rain; while the drivers, in enormous boots,
splashed through the mud beside the sledges.  All
this, the very horses themselves, seemed to me
stimulating and fascinating, full of suggestion.

"When I approached the field near their house,
I saw at one end of it, in the direction of the pa-
rade ground, something very huge and black, and
I heard sounds of fife and drum proceeding from
it. My heart had been full of song, and I had
heard in imagination the tune of the mazurka,
but this was very harsh music.  It was not pleas-
ant.

"'What can that be?' I thought, and went
towards the sound by a slippery path through the
centre of the field.  Walking about a hundred
paces, I began to distinguish many black objects
through the mist.  They were evidently soldiers.
'It is probably a drill,' I thought.

"So I went along in that direction in company
with a blacksmith, who wore a dirty coat and an
apron, and was carrying something.  He walked
ahead of me as we approached the place.  The
soldiers in black uniforms stood in two rows, fac-
ing each other motionless, their guns at rest.  Be-
hind them stood the fifes and drums, incessantly
repeating the same unpleasant tune.

"'What are they doing?' I asked the black-
smith, who halted at my side.

"'A Tartar is being beaten through the ranks
for his attempt to desert,' said the blacksmith in
an angry tone, as he looked intently at the far end
of the line.

"I looked in the same direction, and saw be-
tween the files something horrid approaching me. 
The thing that approached was a man, stripped
to the waist, fastened with cords to the guns of two
soldiers who were leading him.  At his side an
officer in overcoat and cap was walking, whose
figure had a familiar look.  The victim advanced
under the blows that rained upon him from both
sides, his whole body plunging, his feet dragging
through the snow.  Now he threw himself back-
ward, and the subalterns who led him thrust him
forward.  Now he fell forward, and they pulled
him up short; while ever at his side marched the
tall officer, with firm and nervous pace.  It was
Varinka's father, with his rosy face and white
moustache.

"At each stroke the man, as if amazed, turned
his face, grimacing with pain, towards the side
whence the blow came, and showing his white teeth
repeated the same words over and over.  But I
could only hear what the words were when he came
quite near.  He did not speak them, he sobbed
them out,--

"'Brothers, have mercy on me! Brothers, have
mercy on me!' But the brothers had, no mercy,
and when the procession came close to me, I saw
how a soldier who stood opposite me took a firm
step forward and lifting his stick with a whirr,
brought it down upon the man's back.  The man
plunged forward, but the subalterns pulled him
back, and another blow came down from the other
side, then from this side and then from the other. 
The colonel marched beside him, and looking now
at his feet and now at the man, inhaled the air,
puffed out his cheeks, and breathed it out between
his protruded lips.  When they passed the place
where I stood, I caught a glimpse between the two
files of the back of the man that was being pun-
ished.  It was something so many-coloured, wet,
red, unnatural, that I could hardly believe it was a
human body.

"'My God!' muttered the blacksmith.

The procession moved farther away.  The
blows continued to rain upon the writhing, falling
creature; the fifes shrilled and the drums beat, and
the tall imposing figure of the colonel moved along-
side the man, just as before.  Then, suddenly, the
colonel stopped, and rapidly approached a man in
the ranks.

"'I'll teach you to hit him gently,' I heard his
furious voice say.  'Will you pat him like that?
Will you?' and I saw how his strong hand in the
suede glove struck the weak, bloodless, terrified
soldier for not bringing down his stick with suffi-
cient strength on the red neck of the Tartar.

"'Bring new sticks!' he cried, and looking
round, he saw me.  Assuming an air of not know-
ing me, and with a ferocious, angry frown, he
hastily turned away.  I felt so utterly ashamed
that I didn't know where to look.  It was as if I
had been detected in a disgraceful act.  I dropped
my eyes, and quickly hurried home.  All the way
I had the drums beating and the fifes whistling in
my ears.  And I heard the words, 'Brothers, have
mercy on me!' or 'Will you pat him? Will
you?' My heart was full of physical disgust that
was almost sickness.  So much so that I halted sev-
eral times on my way, for I had the feeling that I
was going to be really sick from all the horrors
that possessed me at that sight.  I do not remem-
ber how I got home and got to bed.  But the mo-
ment I was about to fall asleep I heard and saw
again all that had happened, and I sprang up.

"'Evidently he knows something I do not
know,' I thought about the colonel.  'If I knew
what he knows I should certainly grasp--under-
stand--what I have just seen, and it would not
cause me such suffering.'

"But however much I thought about it, I could
not understand the thing that the colonel knew. 
It was evening before I could get to sleep, and then
only after calling on a friend and drinking till I;
was quite drunk.

"Do you think I had come to the conclusion that
the deed I had witnessed was wicked? Oh, no. 
Since it was done with such assurance, and was rec-
ognised by every one as indispensable, they doubt-
less knew something which I did not know.  So I
thought, and tried to understand.  But no matter,
I could never understand it, then or afterwards.
And not being able to grasp it, I could not enter
the service as I had intended.  I don't mean only
the military service:  I did not enter the Civil Serv-
ice either.  And so I have been of no use whatever,
as you can see."

"Yes, we know how useless you've been," said
one of us.  "Tell us, rather, how many people
would be of any use at all if it hadn't been for
you."

"Oh, that's utter nonsense," said Ivan Vasilie-
vich, with genuine annoyance.

"Well; and what about the love affair?

"My love? It decreased from that day. 
When, as often happened, she looked dreamy and
meditative, I instantly recollected the colonel on
the parade ground, and I felt so awkward and
uncomfortable that I began to see her less fre-
quently.  So my love came to naught.  Yes; such
chances arise, and they alter and direct a man's
whole  life," he said in summing up.  "And you
say . . ."
