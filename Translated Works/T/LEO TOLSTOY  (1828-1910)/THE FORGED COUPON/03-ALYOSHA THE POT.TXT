ALYOSHA was the younger brother.  He was
called the Pot, because his mother had once sent
him with a pot of milk to the deacon's wife, and he
had stumbled against something and broken it. 
His mother had beaten him, and the children had
teased him.  Since then he was nicknamed the Pot. 
Alyosha was a tiny, thin little fellow, with ears like
wings, and a huge nose.  "Alyosha has a nose that
looks like a dog on a hill!" the children used to
call after him.  Alyosha went to the village
school, but was not good at lessons; besides, there
was so little time to learn.  His elder brother was
in town, working for a merchant, so Alyosha had
to help his father from a very early age.  When
he was no more than six he used to go out with the
girls to watch the cows and sheep in the pasture,
and a little later he looked after the horses by
day and by night.  And at twelve years of age he
had already begun to plough and to drive the cart. 
The skill was there though the strength was not. 
He was always cheerful.  Whenever the children
made fun of him, he would either laugh or be
silent.  When his father scolded him he would
stand mute and listen attentively, and as soon as
the scolding was over would smile and go on with
his work.  Alyosha was nineteen when his brother
was taken as a soldier.  So his father placed him
with the merchant as a yard-porter.  He was given
his brother's old boots, his father's old coat and
cap, and was taken to town.  Alyosha was de-
lighted with his clothes, but the merchant was not
impressed by his appearance.

"I thought you would bring me a man in Sime-
on's place," he said, scanning Alyosha; "and
you've brought me THIS!  What's the good of
him?"

"He can do everything; look after horses and
drive.  He's a good one to work.  He looks
rather thin, but he's tough enough.  And he's very
willing."

"He looks it.  All right; we'll see what we can
do with him."

So Alyosha remained at the merchant's.

The family was not a large one.  It consisted
of the merchant's wife:  her old mother:  a married
son poorly educated who was in his father's busi-
ness:  another son, a learned one who had finished
school and entered the University, but having been
expelled, was living at home:  and a daughter who
still went to school.

They did not take to Alyosha at first.  He was
uncouth, badly dressed, and had no manner, but
they soon got used to him.  Alyosha worked even
better than his brother had done; he was really
very willing.  They sent him on all sorts of er-
rands, but he did everything quickly and readily,
going from one task to another without stopping. 
And so here, just as at home, all the work was put
upon his shoulders.  The more he did, the more
he was given to do.  His mistress, her old mother,
the son, the daughter, the clerk, and the cook--all
ordered him about, and sent him from one place
to another.

"Alyosha, do this! Alyosha, do that!
What! have you forgotten, Alyosha? Mind you
don't forget, Alyosha!" was heard from morning
till night.  And Alyosha ran here, looked after this
and that, forgot nothing, found time for every-
thing, and was always cheerful.

His brother's old boots were soon worn out,
and his master scolded him for going about in tat-
ters with his toes sticking out.  He ordered an-
other pair to be bought for him in the market. 
Alyosha was delighted with his new boots, but was
angry with his feet when they ached at the end of
the day after so much running about.  And then
he was afraid that his father would be annoyed
when he came to town for his wages, to find that
his master had deducted the cost of the boots.

In the winter Alyosha used to get up before day-
break.  He would chop the wood, sweep the yard,
feed the cows and horses, light the stoves, clean
the boots, prepare the samovars and polish them
afterwards; or the clerk would get him to bring
up the goods; or the cook would set him to knead
the bread and clean the saucepans.  Then he was
sent to town on various errands, to bring the
daughter home from school, or to get some olive
oil for the old mother.  "Why the devil have
you been so long?" first one, then another, would
say to him.  Why should they go? Alyosha can
go. "Alyosha! Alyosha!" And Alyosha ran
here and there.  He breakfasted in snatches while
he was working, and rarely managed to get his
dinner at the proper hour.  The cook used to scold
him for being late, but she was sorry for him all
the same, and would keep something hot for his
dinner and supper.

At holiday times there was more work than ever,
but Alyosha liked holidays because everybody gave
him a tip.  Not much certainly, but it would
amount up to about sixty kopeks [1s 2d]--his
very own money.  For Alyosha never set eyes on
his wages.  His father used to come and take them
from the merchant, and only scold Alyosha for
wearing out his boots.

When he had saved up two roubles [4s], by the
advice of the cook he bought himself a red knitted
jacket, and was so happy when he put it on, that
he couldn't close his mouth for joy.  Alyosha was
not talkative; when he spoke at all, he spoke
abruptly, with his head turned away.  When told
to do anything, or asked if he could do it, he would
say yes without the smallest hesitation, and set to
work at once.

Alyosha did not know any prayer; and had for-
gotten what his mother had taught him.  But he
prayed just the same, every morning and every
evening, prayed with his hands, crossing himself.

He lived like this for about a year and a half,
and towards the end of the second year a most
startling thing happened to him.  He discovered
one day, to his great surprise, that, in addition to
the relation of usefulness existing between people,
there was also another, a peculiar relation of quite
a different character.  Instead of a man being
wanted to clean boots, and go on errands and har-
ness horses, he is not wanted to be of any service
at all, but another human being wants to serve him
and pet him.  Suddenly Alyosha felt he was such
a man.

He made this discovery through the cook Us-
tinia.  She was young, had no parents, and worked
as hard as Alyosha.  He felt for the first time in
his life that he--not his services, but he himself
--was necessary to another human being.  When
his mother used to be sorry for him, he had taken
no notice of her.  It had seemed to him quite
natural, as though he were feeling sorry for him-
self.  But here was Ustinia, a perfect stranger,
and sorry for him.  She would save him some hot
porridge, and sit watching him, her chin propped
on her bare arm, with the sleeve rolled up, while he
was eating it.  When he looked at her she would
begin to laugh, and he would laugh too.

This was such a new, strange thing to him that
it frightened Alyosha.  He feared that it might
interfere with his work.  But he was pleased, nev-
ertheless, and when he glanced at the trousers that
Ustinia had mended for him, he would shake
his head and smile.  He would often think of her
while at work, or when running on errands.  "A
fine girl, Ustinia!" he sometimes exclaimed.

Ustinia used to help him whenever she could,
and he helped her.  She told him all about her
life; how she had lost her parents; how her aunt
had taken her in and found a place for her in the
town; how the merchant's son had tried to take lib-
erties with her, and how she had rebuffed him. 
She liked to talk, and Alyosha liked to listen to her. 
He had heard that peasants who came up to work
in the towns frequently got married to servant
girls.  On one occasion she asked him if his par-
ents intended marrying him soon.  He said that
he did not know; that he did not want to marry
any of the village girls.

"Have you taken a fancy to some one, then?"

"I would marry you, if you'd be willing."

"Get along with you, Alyosha the Pot; but
you've found your tongue, haven't you?" she ex-
claimed, slapping him on the back with a towel she
held in her hand.  "Why shouldn't I?"

At Shrovetide Alyosha's father came to town for
his wages.  It had come to the ears of the mer-
chant's wife that Alyosha wanted to marry Ustinia,
and she disapproved of it.  "What will be the
use of her with a baby?" she thought, and in-
formed her husband.

The merchant gave the old man Alyosha's
wages.

"How is my lad getting on?" he asked.  "I
told you he was willing."

"That's all right, as far as it goes, but he's
taken some sort of nonsense into his head.  He
wants to marry our cook.  Now I don't approve
of married servants.  We won't have them in the
house."

"Well, now, who would have thought the fool
would think of such a thing?" the old man ex-
claimed.  "But don't you worry.  I'll soon settle
that."

He went into the kitchen, and sat down at
the table waiting for his son.  Alyosha was out
on an errand, and came back breathless.

"I thought you had some sense in you; but
what's this you've taken into your head?" his
father began.

"I? Nothing."

"How, nothing? They tell me you want to
get married.  You shall get married when the time
comes.  I'll find you a decent wife, not some town
hussy."

His father talked and talked, while Alyosha
stood still and sighed.  When his father had quite
finished, Alyosha smiled.

"All right.  I'll drop it."

"Now that's what I call sense."

When he was left alone with Ustinia he told her
what his father had said.  (She had listened at
the door.)

"It's no good; it can't come off.  Did you hear?
He was angry--won't have it at any price."

Ustinia cried into her apron.

Alyosha shook his head.

"What's to be done? We must do as we're
told."

"Well, are you going to give up that nonsense,
as your father told you?" his mistress asked, as
he was putting up the shutters in the evening.

"To be sure we are," Alyosha replied with a
smile, and then burst into tears.


From that day Alyosha went about his work as
usual, and no longer talked to Ustinia about their
getting married.  One day in Lent the clerk told
him to clear the snow from the roof.  Alyosha
climbed on to the roof and swept away all the
snow; and, while he was still raking out some
frozen lumps from the gutter, his foot slipped and
he fell over.  Unfortunately he did not fall on the
snow, but on a piece of iron over the door.  Us-
tinia came running up, together with the mer-
chant's daughter.

"Have you hurt yourself, Alyosha?"

"Ah! no, it's nothing."

But he could not raise himself when he tried
to, and began to smile.

He was taken into the lodge.  The doctor ar-
rived, examined him, and asked where he felt the
pain.

"I feel it all over," he said.  "But it doesn't
matter.  I'm only afraid master will be annoyed. 
Father ought to be told."

Alyosha lay in bed for two days, and on the third
day they sent for the priest.

"Are you really going to die?" Ustinia asked. 

"Of course I am.  You can't go on living for
ever.  You must go when the time comes "  Aly-
osha spoke rapidly as usual.  "Thank you, Us-
tinia.  You've been very good to me.  What a
lucky thing they didn't let us marry! Where
should we have been now? It's much better as it
is."

When the priest came, he prayed with his bands
and with his heart.  "As it is good here when you
obey and do no harm to others, so it will be there,"
was the thought within it.

He spoke very little; he only said he was thirsty,
and he seemed full of wonder at something.

He lay in wonderment, then stretched himself,
and died.
