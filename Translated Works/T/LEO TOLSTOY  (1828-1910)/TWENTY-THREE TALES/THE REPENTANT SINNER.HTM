<P>'And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
Kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
<BR>Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.' -- Luke xxiii. 42, 43.

<P>THERE was once a man who lived for seventy years in the world, and lived
in sin all that time. He fell ill but even then did not
<BR>repent. Only at the last moment, as he was dying, he wept and said:

<P>'Lord! forgive me, as Thou forgavest the thief upon the cross.'

<P>And as he said these words, his soul left his body. And the soul of
the sinner, feeling love towards God and faith in His mercy,
<BR>went to the gates of heaven and knocked, praying to be let into the
heavenly kingdom.

<P>Then a voice spoke from within the gate:

<P>'What man is it that knocks at the gates of Paradise and what deeds
did he do during his life?'

<P>And the voice of the Accuser replied, recounting all the man's evil
deeds, and not a single good one.

<P>And the voice from within the gates answered:

<P>'Sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Go hence!'

<P>Then the man said:

<P>'Lord, I hear thy voice, but cannot see thy face, nor do I know thy
name.'

<P>The voice answered:

<P>'I am Peter, the Apostle.'

<P>And the sinner replied:

<P>'Have pity on me, Apostle Peter! Remember man's weakness, and God's
mercy. Wert not thou a disciple of Christ? Didst not thou
<BR>hear his teaching from his own lips, and hadst thou not his example
before thee? Remember then how, when he sorrowed and was
<BR>grieved in spirit, and three times asked thee to keep awake and pray,
thou didst sleep, because thine eyes were heavy, and three
<BR>times he found thee sleeping. So it was with me. Remember, also, how
thou didst promise to be faithful unto death, and yet didst
<BR>thrice deny him, when he was taken before Caiaphas. So it was with
me. And remember, too, how when the cock crowed thou
<BR>didst go out and didst weep bitterly. So it is with me. Thou canst
not refuse to let me in.'

<P>And the voice behind the gates was silent.

<P>Then the sinner stood a little while, and again began to knock, and
to ask to be let into the kingdom of heaven.

<P>And he heard another voice behind the gates, which said:

<P>'Who is this man, and how did he live on earth?'

<P>And the voice of the Accuser again repeated all the sinner's evil deeds,
and not a single good one.

<P>And the voice from behind the gates replied:

<P>'Go hence! Such sinners cannot live with us in Paradise.' Then the sinner
said:

<P>'Lord, I hear thy voice, but I see thee not, nor do I know thy name.'

<P>And the voice answered:

<P>'I am David; king and prophet.'

<P>The sinner did not despair, nor did he leave the gates of Paradise,
but said:

<P>Have pity on me, King David! Remember man's weakness, and God's mercy.
God loved thee and exalted thee among men. Thou
<BR>hadst all: a kingdom, and honour, and riches, and wives, and children;
but thou sawest from thy house-top the wife of a poor man,
<BR>and sin entered into thee, and thou tookest the wife of Uriah, and
didst slay him with the sword of the Ammonites. Thou, a rich
<BR>man, didst take from the poor man his one ewe lamb, and didst kill
him. I have done likewise. Remember, then, how thou didst
<BR>repent, and how thou saidst, "I acknowledge my transgressions: my sin
is ever before me?" I have done the same. Thou canst not
<BR>refuse to let me in.'

<P>And the voice from within the gates was silent.

<P>The sinner having stood a little while, began knocking again, and asking
to be let into the kingdom of heaven. And a third voice
<BR>was heard within the gates, saying:

<P>'Who is this man, and how has he spent his life on earth?'

<P>And the voice of the Accuser replied for the third time, recounting
the sinner's evil deeds, and not mentioning one good deed.

<P>And the voice within the gates said:

<P>'Depart hence! Sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.'

<P>And the sinner said:

<P>'Thy voice I hear, but thy face I see not, neither do I know thy name.'

<P>Then the voice replied:

<P>'I am John the Divine, the beloved disciple of Christ.'

<P>And the sinner rejoiced and said:

<P>'Now surely I shall be allowed to enter. Peter and David must let me
in, because they know man's weakness and God's mercy;
<BR>and thou wilt let me in, because thou lovest much. Was it not thou,
John the Divine who wrote that God is Love, and that he who
<BR>loves not, knows not God? And in thine old age didst thou not say unto
men: "Brethren, love one another." How, then, canst thou
<BR>look on me with hatred, and drive me away? Either thou must renounce
what thou hast said, or loving me, must let me enter the
<BR>kingdom of heaven.'

<P>And the gates of Paradise opened, and John embraced the repentant sinner
and took him into the kingdom of heaven.
