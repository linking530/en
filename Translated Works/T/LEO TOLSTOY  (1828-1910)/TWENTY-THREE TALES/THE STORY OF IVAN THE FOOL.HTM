<P>AND OF HIS TWO BROTHERS, SIMON THE SOLDIER AND TAR&Aacute;S THE STOUT;
AND OF HIS DUMB SISTER
<BR>MARTHA, AND OF THE OLD DEVIL AND THE THREE LITTLE IMPS.

<P>ONCE upon a time, in a certain province of a certain country, there
lived a rich peasant, who had three sons: Simon the Soldier,
<BR>Tar&aacute;s the Stout, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool, besides an unmarried
daughter, Martha, who was deaf and dumb. Simon the Soldier went to
<BR>the wars to serve the king; Tar&aacute;s the Stout went to a merchant's
in town to trade, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool stayed at home with the lass,
<BR>to till the ground till his back bent.

<P>Simon the Soldier obtained high rank and an estate, and married a nobleman's
daughter. His pay was large and his estate was
<BR>large, but yet he could not make ends meet. What the husband earned
his lady wife squandered, and they never had money
<BR>enough.

<P>So Simon the Soldier went to his estate to collect the income, but his
steward said, 'where is any income to come from? We have
<BR>neither cattle, nor tools, nor horse, nor plough, nor harrow. We must
first get all these, and then the money will come.'

<P>Then Simon the Soldier went to his father and said: 'You, father, are
rich, but have given me nothing. Divide what you have, and
<BR>give me a third part, that I may improve my estate.'

<P>But the old man said: 'You brought nothing into my house; why should
I give you a third part? It would be unfair to Iv&aacute;n and to the
<BR>girl.'

<P>But Simon answered, 'He is a fool; and she is an old maid, and deaf
and dumb besides; what's the good of property to them?'

<P>The old man said, 'We will see what Iv&aacute;n says about it.'

<P>And Iv&aacute;n said, 'Let him take what he wants.'

<P>So Simon the Soldier took his share of his father's goods and removed
them to his estate, and went off again to serve the king.

<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout also gathered much money, and married into a
merchant's family, but still he wanted more. So he, also, came to his
<BR>father and said, 'Give me my portion.'

<P>But the old man did not wish to give Tar&aacute;s a share either, and
said, 'You brought nothing here. Iv&aacute;n has earned all we have in
the
<BR>house, and why should we wrong him and the girl?'

<P>But Tar&aacute;s said, 'What does he need? He is a fool! He cannot marry,
no one would have him; and the dumb lass does not need
<BR>anything either. Look here, Iv&aacute;n!' said he, 'give me half the
corn; I don't want the tools, and of the live stock I will take only the
<BR>grey stallion, which is of no use to you for the plough.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n laughed and said, 'Take what you want. I will work to earn
some more.'

<P>So they gave a share to Tar&aacute;s also, and he carted the corn away
to town, and took the grey stallion. And Iv&aacute;n was left with one
<BR>old mare, to lead his peasant life as before, and to support his father
and mother.

<P>II

<P>Now the old Devil was vexed that the brothers had not quarrelled over
the division, but had parted peacefully; and he summoned
<BR>three imps.

<P>'Look here,' said he, 'there are three brothers Simon the Soldier, Tar&aacute;s
the Stout, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool. They should have quarrelled,
<BR>but are living peaceably and meet on friendly terms. The fool Iv&aacute;n
has spoilt the whole business for me. Now you three go and
<BR>tackle those three brothers, and worry them till they scratch each
other's eyes out! Do you think you can do it?'

<P>'Yes, we'll do it,' said they.

<P>'How will you set about it?'

<P>'Why,' said they, 'first we'll ruin them. And when they haven't a crust
to eat we'll tie them up together, and then they'll fight each
<BR>other, sure enough!'

<P>'That's capital; I see you understand your business. Go, and don't come
back till you've set them by the ears, or I'll skin you alive!'

<P>The imps went off into a swamp, and began to consider how they should
set to work. They disputed and disputed, each wanting
<BR>the lightest job; but at last they decided to cast lots which of the
brothers each imp should tackle. If one imp finished his task
<BR>before the others, he was to come and help them. So the imps cast lots,
and appointed a time to meet again in the swamp to learn
<BR>who had succeeded and who needed help.

<P>The appointed time came round, and the imps met again in the swamp as
agreed. And each began to tell how matters stood. The
<BR>first, who had undertaken Simon the Soldier, began: 'My business is
going on well. To-morrow Simon will return to his father's
<BR>house.'

<P>His comrades asked, 'How did you manage it?'

<P>'First,' says he, 'I made Simon so bold that he offered to conquer the
whole world for his king; and the king made him his general
<BR>and sent him to fight the King of India. They met for battle, but the
night before, I damped all the powder in Simon's camp, and
<BR>made more straw soldiers for the Indian King than you could count.
And when Simon's soldiers saw the straw soldiers surrounding
<BR>them, they grew frightened. Simon ordered them to fire; but their cannons
and guns would not go off. Then Simon's soldiers were
<BR>quite frightened, and ran like sheep, and the Indian King slaughtered
them. Simon was disgraced. He has been deprived of his
<BR>estate, and to-morrow they intend to execute him. There is only one
day's work left for me to do; I have just to let him out of
<BR>prison that he may escape home. To-morrow I shall be ready to help
whichever of you needs me.

<P>Then the second imp, who had Tar&aacute;s in hand, began to tell how
he had fared. 'I don't want any help,' said he, 'my job is going all
<BR>right. Tar&aacute;s can't hold out for more than a week. First I caused
him to grow greedy and fat. His covetousness became so great
<BR>that whatever he saw he wanted to buy. He has spent all his money in
buying immense lots of goods, and still continues to buy.
<BR>Already he has begun to use borrowed money. His debts hang like a weight
round his neck, and he is so involved that he can
<BR>never get clear. In a week his bills come due, and before then I will
spoil all his stock. He will be unable to pay and will have to go
<BR>home to his father.'

<P>Then they asked the third imp (Ivan's), 'And how are you getting on?'

<P>'Well,' said he, 'my affair goes badly. First I spat into his drink
to make his stomach ache, and then I went into his field and
<BR>hammered the ground hard as a stone that he should not be able to till
it. I thought he wouldn't plough it, but like the fool that he is,
<BR>he came with his plough and began to make a furrow. He groaned with
the pain in his stomach, but went on ploughing. I broke his
<BR>plough for him, but he went home, got out another, and again started
ploughing. I crept under the earth and caught hold of the
<BR>ploughshares, but there was no holding them; he leant heavily upon
the plough, and the ploughshare was sharp and cut my hands.
<BR>He has all but finished ploughing the field, only one little strip
is left. Come brothers, and help me; for if we don't get the better of
<BR>him, all our labour is lost. If the fool holds out and keeps on working
the land, his brothers will never know want, for he will feed
<BR>them both.'

<P>Simon the Soldier's imp promised to come next day to help, and so they
parted.

<P>III

<P>Iv&aacute;n had ploughed up the whole fallow, all but one little strip.
He came to finish it. Though his stomach ached, the ploughing must
<BR>be done. He freed the harness ropes, turned the plough, and began to
work. He drove one furrow, but coming back the plough
<BR>began to drag as if it had caught in a root. It was the imp, who had
twisted his legs round the ploughshare and was holding it back.

<P>'What a strange thing!' thought Iv&aacute;n. 'There were no roots here
at all, and yet here's a root.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n pushed his hand deep into the furrow, groped about, and,
feeling something soft, seized hold of it and pulled it out. It was
<BR>black like a root, but it wriggled. Why, it was a live imp!

<P>'What a nasty thing!' said Iv&aacute;n, and he lifted his hand to dash
it against the plough, but the imp squealed out:

<P>'Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything you tell me to.'

<P>'What can you do?'

<P>'Anything you tell me to.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n scratched his head.

<P>'My stomach aches,' said he; 'can you cure that?'

<P>'Certainly I can.'

<P>'Well then, do so.'

<P>The imp went down into the furrow, searched about scratched with his
claws, and pulled out a bunch of three little roots, which he
<BR>handed to Iv&aacute;n.

<P>'Here,' says he, 'whoever swallows one of these will be cured of any
illness.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n took the roots, separated them, and swallowed one. The pain
in his stomach was cured at once. The imp again begged to be
<BR>let off; 'I will jump right into the earth, and never come back,' said
he.

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n; 'begone, and God be with you!'

<P>And as soon as Iv&aacute;n mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth
like a stone thrown into the water. Only a hole was left.

<P>Iv&aacute;n put the other two pieces of root into his cap and went on
with his ploughing. He ploughed the strip to the end, turned his
<BR>plough over, and went home. He unharnessed the horse, entered the hut,
and there he saw his elder brother, Simon the Soldier and
<BR>his wife, sitting at supper. Simon's estate had been confiscated, he
himself had barely managed to escape from prison, and he had
<BR>come back to live in his father's house.

<P>Simon saw Iv&aacute;n, and said: 'I have come to live with you. Feed
me and my wife till I get another appointment.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can stay with us.'

<P>But when Iv&aacute;n was about to sit down on the bench the lady disliked
the smell, and said to her husband. 'I cannot sup with a dirty
<BR>peasant.'

<P>So Simon the Soldier said, 'My lady says you don't smell nice. You'd
better go and eat outside.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n; 'any way I must spend the night outside,
for I have to pasture the mare.'

<P>So he took some bread, and his coat, and went with the mare into the
fields.

<P>IV

<P>Having finished his work that night, Simon's imp came, as agreed, to
find Iv&aacute;n's imp and help him to subdue the fool. He came to
<BR>the field and searched and searched; but instead of his comrade he
found only a hole.

<P>'Clearly,' thought he, 'some evil has befallen my comrade. I must take
his place. The field is ploughed up, so the fool must be
<BR>tackled in the meadow.'

<P>So the imp went to the meadows and flooded Iv&aacute;n's hayfield with
water, which left the grass all covered with mud.

<P>Iv&aacute;n returned from the pasture at dawn, sharpened his scythe,
and went to mow the hayfield. He began to mow but had only
<BR>swung the scythe once or twice when the edge turned so that it would
not cut at all, but needed resharpening. Iv&aacute;n struggled on
<BR>for awhile, and then said: 'It's no good. I must go home and bring
a tool to straighten the scythe, and I'll get a chunk of bread at the
<BR>same time. If I have to spend a week here, I won't leave till the mowing's
done.'

<P>The imp heard this and thought to himself, 'This fool is a tough 'un;
I can't get round him this way. I must try some other dodge.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n returned, sharpened his scythe, and began to mow. The imp
crept into the grass and began to catch the scythe by the heel,
<BR>sending the point into the earth. Iv&aacute;n found the work very hard,
but he mowed the whole meadow, except one little bit which was
<BR>in the swamp. The imp crept into the swamp and, thought he to himself,
'Though I cut my paws I will not let him mow.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n reached the swamp. The grass didn't seem thick, but yet
it resisted the scythe. Iv&aacute;n grew angry and began to swing the
<BR>scythe with all his might. The imp had to give in; he could not keep
up with the scythe, and, seeing it was a bad business, he
<BR>scrambled into a bush. Iv&aacute;n swung the scythe, caught the bush,
and cut off half the imp's tail. Then he finished mowing the grass,
<BR>told his sister to rake it up, and went himself to mow the rye. He
went with the scythe, but the dock-tailed imp was there first, and
<BR>entangled the rye so that the scythe was of no use. But Iv&aacute;n
went home and got his sickle, and began to reap with that and he
<BR>reaped the whole of the rye.

<P>'Now it's time,' said he, 'to start on the oats.'

<P>The dock-tailed imp heard this, and thought, 'I couldn't get the better
of him on the rye, but I shall on the oats. Only wait till the
<BR>morning.'

<P>In the morning the imp hurried to the oat field, but the oats were already
mowed down! Iv&aacute;n had mowed them by night, in order
<BR>that less grain should shake out. The imp grew angry.

<P>'He has cut me all over and tired me out -- the fool. It is worse than
war. The accursed fool never sleeps; one can't keep up with
<BR>him. I will get into his stacks now and rot them.'

<P>So the imp entered the rye, and crept among the sheaves, and they began
to rot. He heated them, grew warm himself, and fell
<BR>asleep.

<P>Iv&aacute;n harnessed the mare, and went with the lass to cart the rye.
He came to the heaps, and began to pitch the rye into the cart.
<BR>He tossed two sheaves and again thrust his fork -- right into the imp's
back. He lifts the fork and sees on the prongs a live imp;
<BR>dock-tailed, struggling, wriggling, and trying to jump.

<P>'What, you nasty thing, are you here again?'

<P>'I'm another,' said the imp. 'The first was my brother. I've been with
your brother Simon.'

<P>'Well,' said Iv&aacute;n, whoever you are, you've met the same fate!'

<P>He was about to dash him against the cart, but the imp cried out: 'Let
me off, and I will not only let you alone, but I'll do anything
<BR>you tell me to do.'

<P>'What can you do?'

<P>'I can make soldiers out of anything you like.'

<P>'But what use are they?'

<P>'You can turn them to any use; they can do anything you please.'

<P>'Can they sing?'

<P>'Yes, if you want them to.'

<P>'All right; you may make me some.'

<P>And the imp said, 'Here, take a sheaf of rye, then bump it upright on
the ground, and simply say:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O sheaf! my slave
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This order gave:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a straw has been
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let a soldier be seen!'

<P>Iv&aacute;n took the sheaf, struck it on the ground, and said what the
imp had told him to. The sheaf fell asunder, and all the straws
<BR>changed into soldiers, with a trumpeter and a drummer playing in front,
so that there was a whole regiment.

<P>Iv&aacute;n laughed.

<P>'How clever!' said he. 'This is fine! How pleased the girls will be!'

<P>'Now let me go,' said the imp.

<P>'No,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'I must make my soldiers of thrashed straw,
otherwise good grain will be wasted. Teach me how to change them
<BR>back again into the sheaf. I want to thrash it.'

<P>And the imp said, 'Repeat:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let each be a straw
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was soldier before,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my true slave
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This order gave!"'

<P>Iv&aacute;n said this, and the sheaf reappeared.

<P>Again the imp began to beg, 'Now let me go!

<P>'All right.' And Iv&aacute;n pressed him against the side of the cart,
held him down with his hand, and pulled him off the fork.

<P>'God be with you,' said he.

<P>And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth like
a stone into water. Only a hole was left.

<P>Iv&aacute;n returned home, and there was his other brother, Tar&aacute;s
with his wife, sitting at supper.

<P>Taras the Stout had failed to pay his debts, had run away from his creditors,
and had come home to his father's house. When he
<BR>saw Iv&aacute;n, 'Look here', said he, 'till I can start in business
again, I want you to keep me and my wife.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can live here, if you like.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n took off his coat and sat down to table, but the merchant's
wife said: 'I cannot sit at table with this clown, he smells of
<BR>perspiration.'

<P>Then Tar&aacute;s the Stout said, 'Iv&aacute;n, you smell too strong.
Go and eat outside.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, taking some bread and going into the
yard. 'It is time, anyhow, for me to go and pasture the mare.'

<P>V

<P>Tar&aacute;s's imp, being also free that night, came, as agreed, to
help his comrades subdue Iv&aacute;n the Fool. He came to the cornfield,
<BR>looked and looked for his comrades -- no one was there. He only found
a hole. He went to the meadow, and there he found an
<BR>imp's tail in the swamp, and another hole in the rye stubble.

<P>'Evidently, some ill-luck has befallen my comrades,' thought he. 'I
must take their place and tackle the fool.'

<P>So the imp went to look for Iv&aacute;n, who had already stacked the
corn and was cutting trees in the wood. The two brothers had
<BR>begun to feel crowded, living together, and had told Iv&aacute;n to
cut down trees to build new houses for them.

<P>The imp ran to the wood, climbed among the branches, and began to hinder
Iv&aacute;n from felling the trees. Iv&aacute;n undercut one tree so
<BR>that it should fall clear, but in falling it turned askew and caught
among some branches. Iv&aacute;n cut a pole with which to lever it aside,
<BR>and with difficulty contrived to bring it to the ground. He set to
work to fell another tree -- again the same thing occurred; and with
<BR>all his efforts he could hardly get the tree clear. He began on a third
tree, and again the same thing happened.

<P>Iv&aacute;n had hoped to cut down half a hundred small trees, but had
not felled even half a score, and now the night was come and he
<BR>was tired out. The steam from him spread like a mist through the wood,
but still he stuck to his work. He undercut another tree,
<BR>but his back began to ache so that he could not stand. He drove his
axe into the tree and sat down to rest.

<P>The imp, noticing that Iv&aacute;n had stopped work, grew cheerful.

<P>'At last,' thought he, 'he is tired out! He will give it up. Now I can
take a rest myself.'

<P>He seated himself astride a branch and chuckled. But soon Iv&aacute;n
got up, pulled the axe out, swung it and smote the tree from the
<BR>opposite side with such force that the tree gave way at once and came
crashing down. The imp had not expected this, and had no
<BR>time to get his feet clear, and the tree in breaking, gripped his paw.
Iv&aacute;n began to lop off the branches, when he noticed a live imp
<BR>hanging in the tree! Iv&aacute;n was surprised.

<P>'What, you nasty thing,' says he, 'so you are here again!'

<P>'I am another one,' says the imp. 'I have been with your brother Tar&aacute;s.'

<P>'Whoever you are you have met your fate,' said Iv&aacute;n, and swinging
his axe he was about to strike him with the haft, but the imp
<BR>begged for mercy: 'Don't strike me,' said he, 'and I will do anything
you tell me to.'

<P>'What can you do?'

<P>'I can make money for you, as much as you want.'

<P>'All right, make some.' So the imp showed him how to do it.

<P>'Take,' said he, 'some leaves from this oak and rub them in your hands,
and gold will fall out on the ground.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n took some leaves and rubbed them, and gold ran down from
his hands.

<P>'This stuff will do fine,' said he, 'for the fellows to play with on
their holidays.'

<P>'Now let me go.' said the imp.

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, and taking a lever he set the imp free.
'Now begone! And God be with you,' says he.

<P>And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth, like
a stone into water. Only a hole was left.

<P>VI

<P>So the brothers built houses, and began to live apart; and Iv&aacute;n
finished the harvest work, brewed beer, and invited his brothers to
<BR>spend the next holiday with him. His brothers would not come.

<P>'We don't care about peasant feasts,' said they.

<P>So Iv&aacute;n entertained the peasants and their wives, and drank until
he was rather tipsy. Then he went into the street to a ring of
<BR>dancers; and going up to them he told the women to sing a song in his
honour; 'for,' said he, 'I will give you something you never
<BR>saw in your lives before!'

<P>The women laughed and sang his praises, and when they had finished they
said, 'Now let us have your gift.'

<P>'I will bring it directly,' said he.

<P>He took a seed-basket and ran into the woods. The women laughed. 'He
is a fool!' said they, and they began to talk of something
<BR>else.

<P>But soon Iv&aacute;n came running back, carrying the basket full of
something heavy.

<P>'Shall I give it you?'

<P>'Yes! give it to us.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n took a handful of gold and threw it to the women. You should
have seen them throw themselves upon it to pick it up! And the
<BR>men around scrambled for it, and snatched it from one another. One
old woman was nearly crushed to death. Iv&aacute;n laughed.

<P>'Oh, you fools!' says he. 'Why did you crush the old grandmother? Be
quiet, and I will give you some more,' and he threw them
<BR>some more. The people all crowded round, and Iv&aacute;n threw them
all the gold he had. They asked for more, but Iv&aacute;n said, 'I have
no
<BR>more just now. Another time I'll give you some more. Now let us dance,
and you can sing me your songs.'

<P>The women began to sing.

<P>'Your songs are no good,' says he.

<P>'Where will you find better ones?' say they.

<P>'I'll soon show you,' says he.

<P>He went to the barn, took a sheaf, thrashed it, stood it up, and bumped
it on the ground.

<P>'Now,' said he:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O sheaf! my slave
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This order gave:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a straw has been
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let a soldier be seen!'

<P>And the sheaf fell asunder and became so many soldiers. The drums and
trumpets began to play. Iv&aacute;n ordered the soldiers to play
<BR>and sing. He led them out into the street, and the people were amazed,
The soldiers played and sang, and then Iv&aacute;n (forbidding any
<BR>one to follow him) led them back to the thrashing ground, changed them
into a sheaf again, and threw it in its place.

<P>He then went home and lay down in the stables to sleep.

<P>VII

<P>Simon the Soldier heard of all these things next morning, and went to
his brother.

<P>'Tell me,' says he, 'where you got those soldiers from, and where you
have taken them to?'

<P>'What does it matter to you?' said Iv&aacute;n.

<P>'What does it matter? Why, with soldiers one can do anything. One can
win a kingdom.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n wondered.

<P>'Really!' said he; 'Why didn't you say so before? I'll make you as many
as you like. It's well the lass and I have thrashed so much
<BR>straw.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n took his brother to the barn and said:

<P>'Look here; if I make you some soldiers, you must take them away at
once, for if we have to feed them, they will eat up the whole
<BR>village in a day.'

<P>Simon the Soldier promised to lead the soldiers away; and Iv&aacute;n
began to make them. He bumped a sheaf on the thrashing floor --
<BR>a company appeared. He bumped another sheaf, and there was a second
company. He made so many that they covered the field.

<P>'Will that do?' he asked.

<P>Simon was overjoyed, and said: 'That will do! Thank you, Iv&aacute;n!'

<P>'All right' said Iv&aacute;n. 'If you want more, come back, and I'll
make them. There is plenty of straw this season.'

<P>Simon the Soldier at once took command of his army, collected and organized
it, and went off to make war.

<P>Hardly had Simon the Soldier gone, when Tar&aacute;s the Stout came
along. He, too, had heard of yesterday's affair, and he said to his
<BR>brother:

<P>'Show me where you get gold money! If I only had some to start with,
I could make it bring me in money from all over the world.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n was astonished.

<P>'Really!' said he. 'You should have told me sooner. I will make you
as much as you like.'

<P>His brother was delighted.

<P>'Give me three baskets-full to begin with.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n. 'Come into the forest; or better still,
let us harness the mare, for you won't be able to carry it all.'

<P>They drove to the forest, and Iv&aacute;n began to rub the oak leaves.
He made a great heap of gold.

<P>'Will that do?'

<P>Tar&aacute;s was overjoyed.

<P>'It will do for the present,' said he. 'Thank you, Iv&aacute;n!'

<P>'All right,' says Iv&aacute;n, 'if you want more, come back for it.
There are plenty of leaves left.'

<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout gathered up a whole cartload of money, and went
off to trade.

<P>So the two brothers went away: Simon to fight and Tar&aacute;s to buy
and sell. And Simon the Soldier conquered a kingdom for himself;
<BR>and Tar&aacute;s the Stout made much money in trade.

<P>When the two brothers met, each told the other: Simon how he got the
soldiers, and Tar&aacute;s how he got the money. And Simon the
<BR>Soldier said to his brother, I have conquered a kingdom and live in
grand style but I have not money enough to keep my soldiers.'

<P>And Tar&aacute;s the Stout said, 'And I have made much money, but the
trouble is, I have no one to guard it.'

<P>Then said Simon the Soldier, 'Let us go to our brother. I will tell
him to make more soldiers, and will give them to you to guard your
<BR>money, and you can tell him to make money for me to feed my men.

<P>And they drove away to Iv&aacute;n; and Simon said, 'Dear brother, I
have not enough soldiers; make me another couple of ricks or so.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n shook his head.

<P>'No!' says he' 'I will not make any more soldiers.'

<P>'But you promised you would.'

<P>'I know I promised, but I won't make any more.'

<P>'But why not, fool?'

<P>'Because your soldiers killed a man. I was ploughing the other day near
the road, and I saw a woman taking a coffin along in a
<BR>cart, and crying. I asked her who was dead. She said, "Simon's soldiers
have killed my husband in the war." I thought the soldiers
<BR>would only play tunes, but they have killed a man. I won't give you
any more.'

<P>And he stuck to it, and would not make any more soldiers.

<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout, too, began to beg Iv&aacute;n to make him more
gold money. But Iv&aacute;n shook his head.

<P>'No, I won't make any more,' said he.

<P>'Didn't you promise?'

<P>'I did, but I'll make no more,' said he.

<P>'Why not, fool?'

<P>'Because your gold coins took away the cow from Michael's daughter.'

<P>'How?'

<P>'Simply took it away! Michael's daughter had a cow. Her children used
to drink the milk. But the other day her children came to
<BR>me to ask for milk. I said, "Where's your cow?" They answered, "The
steward of Tar&aacute;s the Stout came and gave mother three
<BR>bits of gold, and she gave him the cow, so we have nothing to drink."
I thought you were only going to play with the gold pieces,
<BR>but you have taken the children's cow away. I will not give you any
more.'

<P>And Iv&aacute;n stuck to it and would not give him any more. So the
brothers went away. And as they went they discussed how they
<BR>could meet their difficulties. And Simon said:

<P>'Look here, I tell you what to do. You give me money to feed my soldiers,
and I will give you half my kingdom with soldiers
<BR>enough to guard your money.' Tar&aacute;s agreed. So the brothers divided
what they possessed, and both became kings, and both were
<BR>rich.

<P>VIII

<P>Iv&aacute;n lived at home, supporting his father and mother and working
in the fields with his dumb sister. Now it happened that Iv&aacute;n's
<BR>yard-dog fell sick, grew mangy, and was near dying. Iv&aacute;n, pitying
it, got some bread from his sister, put it in his cap, carried it out,
<BR>and threw it to the dog. But the cap was torn, and together with the
bread one of the little roots fell to the ground. The old dog ate
<BR>it up with the bread, and as soon as she had swallowed it she jumped
up and began to play, bark, and wag her tail -- in short
<BR>became quite well again.

<P>The father and mother saw it and were amazed.

<P>'How did you cure the dog?' asked they.

<P>Iv&aacute;n answered: 'I had two little roots to cure any pain, and
she swallowed one.'

<P>Now about that time it happened that the King's daughter fell ill, and
the King proclaimed in every town and village, that he would
<BR>reward any one who could heal her, and if any unmarried man could heal
the King's daughter he should have her for his wife. This
<BR>was proclaimed in Ivan's village as well as everywhere else.

<P>His father and mother called Iv&aacute;n, and said to him: 'Have you
heard what the King has proclaimed? You said you had a root that
<BR>would cure any sickness. Go and heal the King's daughter, and you will
be made happy for life.'

<P>'All right,' said he.

<P>And Iv&aacute;n prepared to go, and they dressed him in his best. But
as he went out of the door he met a beggar woman with a crippled
<BR>hand.

<P>'I have heard,' said she, 'that you can heal people. I pray you cure
my arm, for I cannot even put on my boots myself.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, and giving the little root to the beggar
woman he told her to swallow it. She swallowed it, and was cured. She
<BR>was at once able to move her arm freely.

<P>His father and mother came out to accompany Iv&aacute;n to the King,
but when they heard that he had given away the root, and that he
<BR>had nothing left to cure the King's daughter with, they began to scold
him.

<P>'You pity a beggar woman, but are not sorry for the King's daughter!'
said they. But Iv&aacute;n felt sorry for the King's daughter also.
<BR>So he harnessed the horse, put straw in the cart to sit on, and sat
down to drive away.

<P>'Where are you going, fool?'

<P>'To cure the King's daughter.'

<P>'But you've nothing left to cure her with?'

<P>'Never mind,' said he, and drove off.

<P>He drove to the King's palace, and as soon as he stepped on the threshold
the King's daughter got well.

<P>The King was delighted, and had Iv&aacute;n brought to him, and had
him dressed in fine robes.

<P>'Be my son-in-law,' said he.

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n.

<P>And Iv&aacute;n married the Princess. Her father died soon after, and
Iv&aacute;n became King. So all three brothers were now kings.

<P>IX

<P>The three brothers lived and reigned. The eldest brother, Simon the
Soldier, prospered. With his straw soldiers he levied real
<BR>soldiers. He ordered throughout his whole kingdom a levy of one soldier
from every ten houses, and each soldier had to be tall, and
<BR>clean in body and in face. He gathered many such soldiers and trained
them; and when any one opposed him, he sent these
<BR>soldiers at once, and got his own way, so that every one began to fear
him, and his life was a comfortable one. Whatever he cast
<BR>his eyes on and wished for, was his. He sent soldiers, and they brought
him all he desired.

<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout also lived comfortably. He did not waste the
money he got from Iv&aacute;n, but increased it largely. He introduced
law
<BR>and order into his kingdom. He kept his money in coffers, and taxed
the people. He instituted a poll-tax, tolls for walking and
<BR>driving, and a tax on shoes and stockings and dress trimmings. And
whatever he wished for he got. For the sake of money, people
<BR>brought him everything, and they offered to work for him -- for every
one wanted money.

<P>Iv&aacute;n the Fool, also, did not live badly. As soon as he had buried
his father-in-law, he took off all his royal robes and gave them to
<BR>his wife to put away in a chest; and he again donned his hempen shirt,
his breeches and peasant shoes, and started again to work.

<P>'It's dull for me,' said he. 'I'm getting fat and have lost my appetite
and my sleep.' So he brought his father and mother and his
<BR>dumb sister to live with him, and worked as before.

<P>People said, 'But you are a king!'

<P>'Yes,' said he, 'but even a king must eat.'

<P>One of his ministers came to him and said, 'We have no money to pay
salaries.'

<P>'All right,' says he, 'then don't pay them.'

<P>'Then no one will serve.'

<P>'All right; let them not serve. They will have more time to work; let
them cart manure. There is plenty of scavenging to be done.'

<P>And people came to Iv&aacute;n to be tried. One said. 'He stole my money.'
And Iv&aacute;n said, 'All right, that shows that he wanted it.'

<P>And they all got to know that Iv&aacute;n was a fool. And his wife said
to him, 'People say that you are a fool.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n.

<P>His wife thought and thought about it, but she also was a fool.

<P>'Shall I go against my husband? Where the needle goes the thread follows,'
said she.

<P>So she took off her royal dress, put it away in a chest, and went to
the dumb girl to learn to work. And she learned to work and
<BR>began to help her husband.

<P>And all the wise men left Iv&aacute;n's kingdom; only the fools remained.

<P>Nobody had money. They lived and worked. They fed themselves; and they
fed others.

<P>The old Devil waited and waited for news from the imps of their having
ruined the three brothers. But no news came. So he went
<BR>himself to inquire about it. He searched and searched, but instead
of finding the three imps he found only the three holes.

<P>'Evidently they have failed,' thought he. 'I shall have to tackle it
myself.'

<P>So he went to look for the brothers, but they were no longer in their
old places. He found them in three different kingdoms. All
<BR>three were living and reigning. This annoyed the old Devil very much.

<P>'Well,' said he, 'I must try my own hand at the job.'

<P>First he went to King Simon. He did not go to him in his own shape,
but disguised himself as a general, and drove to Simon's
<BR>palace.

<P>'I hear, King Simon,' said he, 'that you are a great warrior, and as
I know that business well, I desire to serve you.'

<P>King Simon questioned him, and seeing that he was a wise man, took him
into his service.

<P>The new commander began to teach King Simon how to form a strong army.

<P>'First,' said he, 'we must levy more soldiers, for there are in your
kingdom many people unemployed. We must recruit all the young
<BR>men without exception. Then you will have five times as many soldiers
as formerly. Secondly, we must get new rifles and
<BR>cannons. I will introduce rifles that will fire a hundred balls at
once; they will fly out like peas. And I will get cannons that will
<BR>consume with fire either man, or horse, or wall. They will burn up
everything!'

<P>Simon the King listened to the new commander, ordered all young men
without exception to be enrolled as soldiers, and had new
<BR>factories built in which he manufactured large quantities of improved
rifles and cannons. Then he made haste to declare war
<BR>against a neighbouring king. As soon as he met the other army, King
Simon ordered his soldiers to rain balls against it and shoot
<BR>fire from the cannons, and at one blow he burned and crippled half
the enemy's army. The neighbouring king was so thoroughly
<BR>frightened that he gave way and surrendered his kingdom. King Simon
was delighted.

<P>'Now,' said he, 'I will conquer the King of India.'

<P>But the Indian King had heard about King Simon and had adopted all his
inventions, and added more of his own. The Indian King
<BR>enlisted not only all the young men, but all the single women also,
and got together a greater army even than King Simon's. And he
<BR>copied all King Simon's rifles and cannons, and invented a way of flying
through the air to throw explosive bombs from above.

<P>King Simon set out to fight the Indian King, expecting to beat him as
he had beaten the other king; but the scythe that had cut so
<BR>well had lost its edge. The King of India did not let Simon's army
come within gunshot, but sent his women through the air to hurl
<BR>down explosive bombs on to Simon's army. The women began to rain down
bombs on to the army like borax upon cockroaches.
<BR>The army ran away, and Simon the King was left alone. So the Indian
King took Simon's kingdom, and Simon the Soldier fled as
<BR>best he might.

<P>Having finished with this brother, the old Devil went to King Tar&aacute;s.
Changing himself into a merchant, he settled in Tar&aacute;s's
<BR>kingdom, started a house of business, and began spending money. He
paid high prices for everything, and everybody hurried to the
<BR>new merchant's to get money. And so much money spread among the people
that they began to pay all their taxes promptly, and
<BR>paid up all their arrears, and King Tar&aacute;s rejoiced.

<P>'Thanks to the new merchant,' thought he, 'I shall have more money than
ever; and my life will be yet more comfortable.'

<P>And Tar&aacute;s the King began to form fresh plans, and began to build
a new palace. He gave notice that people should bring him
<BR>wood and stone, and come to work, and he fixed high prices for everything.
King Tar&aacute;s thought people would come in crowds to
<BR>work as before, but to his surprise all the wood and stone was taken
to the merchant's, and all the workmen went there too. King
<BR>Tar&aacute;s increased his price, but the merchant bid yet more. King
Tar&aacute;s had much money, but the merchant had still more, and outbid
<BR>the King at every point.

<P>The King's palace was at a standstill; the building did not get on.

<P>King Tar&aacute;s planned a garden, and when autumn came he called for
the people to come and plant the garden, but nobody came. All
<BR>the people were engaged digging a pond for the merchant. Winter came,
and King Tar&aacute;s wanted to buy sable furs for a new
<BR>overcoat. He sent to buy them, but the messengers returned and said,
'There are no sables left. The merchant has all the furs. He
<BR>gave the best price, and made carpets of the skins.'

<P>King Tar&aacute;s wanted to buy some stallions. He sent to buy them,
but the messengers returned saying, 'The merchant has all the
<BR>good stallions; they are carrying water to fill his pond.

<P>All the King's affairs came to a standstill. Nobody would work for him,
for every one was busy working for the merchant; and
<BR>they only brought King Tar&aacute;s the merchant's money to pay their
taxes.

<P>And the King collected so much money that he had nowhere to store it,
and his life became wretched. He ceased to form plans,
<BR>and would have been glad enough simply to live, but he was hardly able
even to do that. He ran short of everything. One after
<BR>another his cooks, coachmen, and servants left him to go to the merchant.
Soon he lacked even food. When he sent to the market
<BR>to buy anything, there was nothing to be got -- the merchant had bought
up everything, and people only brought the King money to
<BR>pay their taxes.

<P>Tar&aacute;s the King got angry and banished the merchant from the country.
But the merchant settled just across the frontier, and went
<BR>on as before. For the sake of the merchant's money, people took everything
to him instead of to the King.

<P>Things went badly with King Tar&aacute;s. For days together he had nothing
to eat, and a rumour even got about that the merchant was
<BR>boasting that he would buy up the King himself! King Tar&aacute;s got
frightened, and did not know what to do.

<P>At this time Simon the Soldier came to him, saying, 'Help me, for the
King of India has conquered me.'

<P>But King Tar&aacute;s himself was over head and ears in difficulties.
'I myself,' said he, 'have had nothing to eat for two days.'

<P>XI

<P>Having done with the two brothers, the old Devil went to Iv&aacute;n.
He changed himself into a General, and coming to Iv&aacute;n began to
<BR>persuade him that he ought to have an army.

<P>'It does not become a king,' said he, 'to be without an army. Only give
me the order, and I will collect soldiers from among your
<BR>people, and form one.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n listened to him. 'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'form an
army, and teach them to sing songs well. I like to hear them do that.'

<P>So the old Devil went through Ivan's kingdom to enlist men. He told
them to go and be entered as soldiers, and each should have a
<BR>quart of spirits and a fine red cap.

<P>The people laughed.

<P>'We have plenty of spirits,' said they. 'We make it ourselves; and as
for caps, the women make all kinds of them, even striped ones
<BR>with tassels.'

<P>So nobody would enlist.

<P>The old Devil came to Iv&aacute;n and said: 'Your fools won't enlist
of their own free will. We shall have to make them.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can try.'

<P>So the old Devil gave notice that all the people were to enlist, and
that Iv&aacute;n would put to death any one who refused.

<P>The people came to the General and said, 'You say that if we do not
go as soldiers the King will put us to death, but you don't say
<BR>what will happen if we do enlist. We have heard say that soldiers get
killed!'

<P>'Yes, that happens sometimes.'

<P>When the people heard this they became obstinate.

<P>'We won't go,' said they. 'Better meet death at home. Either way we
must die.'

<P>'Fools! You are fools!' said the old Devil. 'A soldier may be killed
or he may not, but if you don't go, King Iv&aacute;n will have you killed
<BR>for certain.'

<P>The people were puzzled, and went to Iv&aacute;n the Fool to consult
him.

<P>'A General has come,' said they, 'who says we must all become soldiers.
"If you go as soldiers," says he "you may be killed or you
<BR>may not, but if you don't go, King Iv&aacute;n will certainly kill
you." Is this true?'

<P>Iv&aacute;n laughed and said, 'How can I, alone, put all you to death?
If I were not a fool I would explain it to you but as it is, I don't
<BR>understand it myself.'

<P>'Then' said they, 'we will not serve.'

<P>'All right,' says he, 'don't.'

<P>So the people went to the General and refused to enlist. And the old
Devil saw that this game was up, and he went off and
<BR>ingratiated himself with the King of Tarak&aacute;n.

<P>'Let us make war,' says he, 'and conquer King Iv&aacute;n's country.
It is true there is no money, but there is plenty of corn and cattle
<BR>and everything else.'

<P>So the King of Tarak&aacute;n prepared to make war. He mustered a great
army, provided rifles and cannons, marched to the frontier,
<BR>and entered Iv&aacute;n's kingdom.

<P>And people came to Iv&aacute;n and said, 'The King of Tarak&aacute;n
is coming to make war on us.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'let him come.'

<P>Having crossed the frontier, the King of Tarak&aacute;n sent scouts
to look for Iv&aacute;n's army. They looked and looked, but there was no
<BR>army! They waited and waited for one to appear somewhere, but there
were no signs of an army, and nobody to fight with. The
<BR>King of Tarak&aacute;n then sent to seize the villages. The soldiers
came to a village, and the people, both men and women, rushed out in
<BR>astonishment to stare at the soldiers. The soldiers began to take their
corn and cattle; the people let them have it, and did not resist.
<BR>The soldiers went on to another village; the same thing happened again.
The soldiers went on for one day, and for two days, and
<BR>everywhere the same thing happened. The people let them have everything,
and no one resisted, but only invited the soldiers to live
<BR>with them.

<P>'Poor fellows,' said they, 'if you have a hard life in your own land,
why don't you come and stay with us altogether?'

<P>The soldiers marched and marched: still no army, only people living
and feeding themselves and others, and not resisting, but
<BR>inviting the soldiers to stay and live with them. The soldiers found
it dull work, and they came to the King of Tarak&aacute;n and said, 'We
<BR>cannot fight here, lead us elsewhere. War is all right, but what is
this? It is like cutting pea-soup! We will not make war here any
<BR>more.'

<P>The King of Tarak&aacute;n grew angry, and ordered his soldiers to over-run
the whole kingdom, to destroy the villages, to burn the grain
<BR>and the houses, and to slaughter the cattle. 'And if you do not obey
my orders,' said he, 'I will execute you all.'

<P>The soldiers were frightened, and began to act according to the King's
orders. They began to burn houses and corn, and to kill
<BR>cattle. But the fools still offered no resistance, and only wept. The
old men wept, and the old women wept, and the young people
<BR>wept.

<P>'Why do you harm us?' they said. 'Why do you waste good things? If you
need them, why do you not take them for yourselves?'

<P>At last the soldiers could stand it no longer. They refused to go any
further, and the army disbanded and fled.

<P>XII

<P>The old Devil had to give it up. He could not get the better of Iv&aacute;n
with soldiers. So he changed himself into a fine gentleman, and
<BR>settled down in Ivan's kingdom. He meant to overcome him by means of
money, as he had overcome Tar&aacute;s the Stout.

<P>'I wish,' says he, 'to do you a good turn, to teach you sense and reason.
I will build a house among you and organize a trade.'

<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'come and live among us if you like.'

<P>Next morning the fine gentleman went out into the public square with
a big sack of gold and a sheet of paper, and said, 'You all
<BR>live like swine. I wish to teach you how to live properly. Build me
a house according to this plan. You shall work, I will tell you
<BR>how, and I will pay you with gold coins.' And he showed them the gold.

<P>The fools were astonished; there was no money in use among them; they
bartered their goods, and paid one another with labour.
<BR>They looked at the gold coins with surprise.

<P>'What nice little things they are!' said they.

<P>And they began to exchange their goods and labour for the gentleman's
gold pieces. And the old Devil began, as in Tar&aacute;s's
<BR>kingdom, to be free with his gold, and the people began to exchange
everything for gold and to do all sorts of work for it.

<P>The old Devil was delighted, and thought he to himself, 'Things are
going right this time. Now I shall ruin the Fool as I did Tar&aacute;s,
<BR>and I shall buy him up body and soul.'

<P>But as soon as the fools had provided themselves with gold pieces they
gave them to the women for necklaces. The lasses plaited
<BR>them into their tresses, and at last the children in the street began
to play with the little pieces. Everybody had plenty of them, and
<BR>they stopped taking them. But the fine gentleman's mansion was not
yet half-built, and the grain and cattle for the year were not
<BR>yet provided. So he gave notice that he wished people to come and work
for him, and that he wanted cattle and grain; for each
<BR>thing, and for each service, he was ready to give many more pieces
of gold.

<P>But nobody came to work and nothing was brought. Only sometimes a boy
or a little girl would run up to exchange an egg for a
<BR>gold coin, but nobody else came, and he had nothing to eat. And being
hungry, the fine gentleman went through the village to try
<BR>and buy something for dinner. He tried at one house, and offered a
gold piece for a fowl, but the housewife wouldn't take it.

<P>'I have a lot already,' said she.

<P>He tried at a widow's house to buy a herring, and offered a gold piece.

<P>'I don't want it, my good sir,' said she. 'I have no children to play
with it, and I myself already have three coins as curiosities.'

<P>He tried at a peasant's house to get bread, but neither would the peasant
take money.

<P>'I don't need it,' said he, 'but if you are begging "for Christ's sake[15],"
wait a bit and I'll tell the housewife to cut you a piece of
<BR>bread.'

<P>At that the Devil spat, and ran away. To hear Christ's name mentioned,
let alone receiving anything for Christ's sake, hurt him
<BR>more than sticking a knife into him.

<P>And so he got no bread. Every one had gold, and no matter where the
old Devil went, nobody would give anything for money, but
<BR>every one said, 'Either bring something else, or come and work, or
receive what you want in charity for Christ's sake.'

<P>But the old Devil had nothing but money; for work he had no liking,
and as for taking anything 'for Christ's sake' he could not do
<BR>that. The old Devil grew very angry.

<P>'What more do you want, when I give you money?' said he. 'You can buy
everything with gold, and hire any kind of labourer.' But
<BR>the fools did not heed him.

<P>'No, we do not want money,' said they. 'We have no payments to make,
and no taxes, so what should we do with it?'

<P>The old Devil lay down to sleep -- supperless.

<P>The affair was told to Iv&aacute;n the Fool. People came and asked him,
'What are we to do? A fine gentleman has turned up, who likes
<BR>to eat and drink and dress well, but he does not like to work, does
not beg in "Christ's name," but only offers gold pieces to every
<BR>one. At first people gave him all he wanted until they had plenty of
gold pieces, but now no one gives him anything. What's to be
<BR>done with him? He will die of hunger before long.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n listened.

<P>'All right,' says he, 'we must feed him. Let him live by turn at each
house as a shepherd[16] does.'

<P>There was no help for it. The old Devil had to begin making the round.

<P>In due course the turn came for him to go to Ivan's house. The old Devil
came in to dinner, and the dumb girl was getting it ready.

<P>She had often been deceived by lazy folk who came early to dinner --
without having done their share of work -- and ate up all the
<BR>porridge, so it had occurred to her to find out the sluggards by their
hands. Those who had horny hands, she put at the table, but
<BR>the others got only the scraps that were left over.

<P>The old Devil sat down at the table, but the dumb girl seized him by
the hands and looked at them -- there were no hard places
<BR>there: the hands were clean and smooth, with long nails. The dumb girl
gave a grunt and pulled the Devil away from the table. And
<BR>Iv&aacute;n's wife said to him, 'Don't be offended, fine gentleman.
My sister-in-law does not allow any one to come to table who hasn't
<BR>horny hands. But wait awhile, after the folk have eaten you shall have
what is left.'

<P>The old Devil was offended that in the King's house they wished him
to feed like a pig. He said to Iv&aacute;n, 'It is a foolish law you
<BR>have in your kingdom that every one must work with his hands. It's
your stupidity that invented it. Do people work only with their
<BR>hands? What do you think wise men work with?'

<P>And Iv&aacute;n said, 'How are we fools to know? We do most of our work
with our hands and our backs.'

<P>'That is because you are fools! But I will teach you how to work with
the head. Then you will know that it is more profitable to
<BR>work with the head than with the hands.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n was surprised.

<P>'If that is so' said he, 'then there is some sense in calling us fools!'

<P>And the old Devil went on. 'Only it is not easy to work with one's head.
You give me nothing to eat, because I have no hard
<BR>places on my hands, but you do not know that it is a hundred times
more difficult to work with the head. Sometimes one's head
<BR>quite splits.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n became thoughtful.

<P>'Why, then, friend, do you torture yourself so? Is it pleasant when
the head splits? Would it not be better to do easier work with
<BR>your hands and your back?'

<P>But the Devil said, 'I do it all out of pity for you fools. If I didn't
torture myself you would remain fools for ever. But, having
<BR>worked with my head, I can now teach you.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n was surprised.

<P>'Do teach us!' said he, 'so that when our hands get cramped we may use
our heads for a change.'

<P>And the Devil promised to teach the people. So Iv&aacute;n gave notice
throughout the kingdom that a fine gentleman had come who
<BR>would teach everybody how to work with their heads; that with the head
more could be done than with the hands; and that the
<BR>people ought all to come and learn.

<P>Now there was in Ivan's kingdom a high tower, with many steps leading
up to a lantern on the top. And Iv&aacute;n took the gentleman
<BR>up there that every one might see him.

<P>So the gentleman took his place on the top of the tower and began to
speak, and the people came together to see him. They
<BR>thought the gentleman would really show them how to work with the head
without using the hands. But the old Devil only taught
<BR>them in many words how they might live without working. The people
could make nothing of it. They looked and considered, and
<BR>at last went off to attend to their affairs.

<P>The old Devil stood on the tower a whole day, and after that a second
day, talking all the time. But standing there so long he grew
<BR>hungry, and the fools never thought of taking food to him up in the
tower. They thought that if he could work with his head better
<BR>than with his hands, he could at any rate easily provide himself with
bread.

<P>The old Devil stood on the top of the tower yet another day, talking
away. People came near, looked on for awhile, and then went
<BR>away.

<P>And Iv&aacute;n asked, 'Well, has the gentleman begun to work with his
head yet?'

<P>'Not yet,' said the people; 'he's still spouting away.'

<P>The old Devil stood on the tower one day more, but he began to grow
weak, so that he staggered and hit his head against one of
<BR>the pillars of the lantern. One of the people noticed it and told Ivan's
wife, and she ran to her husband, who was in the field.

<P>'Come and look,' said she. 'They say the gentleman is beginning to work
with his head.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n was surprised.

<P>'Really?' says he, and he turned his horse round, and went to the tower.
And by the time he reached the tower the old Devil was
<BR>quite exhausted with hunger, and was staggering and knocking his head
against the pillars. And just as Iv&aacute;n arrived at the tower,
<BR>the Devil stumbled, fell, and came bump, bump, bump, straight down
the stairs to the bottom, counting each step with a knock of
<BR>his head!

<P>'Well!' says Iv&aacute;n, 'the fine gentleman told the truth when he
said that "sometimes one's head quite splits." This is worse than
<BR>blisters; after such work there will be swellings on the head.'

<P>The old Devil tumbled out at the foot of the stairs, and struck his
head against the ground. Iv&aacute;n was about to go up to him to see
<BR>how much work he had done -- when suddenly the earth opened and the
old Devil fell through. Only a hole was left.

<P>Iv&aacute;n scratched his head.

<P>'What a nasty thing,' says he. 'It's one of those devils again! What
a whopper! He must be the father of them all.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n is still living, and people crowd to his kingdom. His own
brothers have come to live with him, and he feeds them, too. To
<BR>every one who comes and says 'Give me food!' Iv&aacute;n says, 'All
right. You can stay with us; we have plenty of everything.'

<P>Only there is one special custom in his kingdom; whoever has horny hands
comes to table, but whoever has not, must eat what the
<BR>others leave.
