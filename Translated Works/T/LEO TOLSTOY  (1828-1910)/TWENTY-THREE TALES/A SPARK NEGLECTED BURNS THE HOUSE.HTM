<P>'Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus
<BR>saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until
seventy times seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened
<BR>unto a certain king, which would make a reckoning with his servants.
And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto
<BR>him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not
wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold,
<BR>and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be
made. The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him,
<BR>saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And the
lord of that servant, being moved with compassion,
<BR>released him, and forgave him the debt. But that servant went out,
and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him a
<BR>hundred pence: and he laid hold on him, and took him by the throat
saying, Pay what thou owest. So his fellow-servant fell
<BR>down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay
thee. And he would not: but went and cast him into
<BR>prison, till he should pay that which was due. So when his fellow-servants
saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and
<BR>came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord called
him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I
<BR>forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me: shouldest
not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as
<BR>I had mercy on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the
tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. So shall
<BR>also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his
brother from your hearts.' -- Matt. xviii. 21-35.

<P>THERE once lived in a village a peasant named Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f.
He was comfortably off, in the prime of life, the best worker
<BR>in the village, and had three sons all able to work. The eldest was
married, the second about to marry, and the third was a big
<BR>lad who could mind the horses and was already beginning to plough.
Ivan's wife was an able and thrifty woman, and they were
<BR>fortunate in having a quiet, hard-working daughter-in-law. There was
nothing to prevent Iv&aacute;n and his family from living happily.
<BR>They had only one idle mouth to feed; that was Iv&aacute;n's old father,
who suffered from asthma and had been lying ill on the top of
<BR>the brick oven for seven years. Iv&aacute;n had all he needed: three
horses and a colt, a cow with a calf, and fifteen sheep. The
<BR>women made all the clothing for the family, besides helping in the
fields, and the men tilled the land. They always had grain
<BR>enough of their own to last over beyond the next harvest and sold enough
oats to pay the taxes and meet their other needs. So
<BR>Iv&aacute;n and his children might have lived quite comfortably had
it not been for a feud between him and his next-door neighbour,
<BR>Limping Gabriel, the son of Gord&eacute;y Iv&aacute;nof.

<P>As long as old Gord&eacute;y was alive and Iv&aacute;n's father was
still able to manage the household, the peasants lived as neighbours
<BR>should. If the women of either house happened to want a sieve or a
tub, or the men required a sack, or if a cart-wheel got
<BR>broken and could not be mended at once, they used to send to the other
house, and helped each other in neighbourly fashion.
<BR>When a calf strayed into the neighbour's thrashing-ground they would
just drive it out, and only say, 'Don't let it get in again; our
<BR>grain is lying there.' And such things as locking up the barns and
outhouses, hiding things from one another, or backbiting were
<BR>never thought of in those days.

<P>That was in the fathers' time. When the sons came to be at the head
of the families, everything changed.

<P>It all began about a trifle.

<P>Iv&aacute;n's daughter-in-law had a hen that began laying rather early
in the season, and she started collecting its eggs for Easter.
<BR>Every day she went to the cart-shed, and found an egg in the cart;
but one day the hen, probably frightened by the children,
<BR>flew across the fence into the neighbour's yard and laid its egg there.
The woman heard the cackling, but said to herself: 'I have
<BR>no time now; I must tidy up for Sunday. I'll fetch the egg later on.'
In the evening she went to the cart, but found no egg there.
<BR>She went and asked her mother-in-law and brother-in-law whether they
had taken the egg. 'No,' they had not; but her
<BR>youngest brother-in-law, Tar&aacute;s, said: 'Your Biddy laid its egg
in the neighbour's yard. It was there she was cackling, and she
<BR>flew back across the fence from there.'

<P>The woman went and looked at the hen. There she was on the perch with
the other birds, her eyes just closing ready to go to
<BR>sleep. The woman wished she could have asked the hen and got an answer
from her.

<P>Then she went to the neighbour's, and Gabriel's mother came out to meet
her.

<P>'What do you want, young woman?'

<P>'Why, Granny, you see, my hen flew across this morning. Did she not
lay an egg here?'

<P>'We never saw anything of it. The Lord be thanked, our own hens started
laying long ago. We collect our own eggs and have
<BR>no need of other people's! And we don't go looking for eggs in other
people's yards, lass!'

<P>The young woman was offended, and said more than she should have done.
Her neighbour answered back with interest, and
<BR>the women began abusing each other. Ivan's wife, who had been to fetch
water, happening to pass just then, joined in too.
<BR>Gabriel's wife rushed out, and began reproaching the young woman with
things that had really happened and with other things
<BR>that never had happened at all. Then a general uproar commenced, all
shouting at once, trying to get out two words at a time,
<BR>and not choice words either.

<P>'You're this!' and 'You're that!' 'You're a thief!' and 'You're a slut!'
and 'You're starving your old father-in-law to death!' and
<BR>'You're a good-for-nothing!' and so on.

<P>'And you've made a hole in the sieve I lent you, you jade! And it's
our yoke you're carrying your pails on -- you just give back
<BR>our yoke!'

<P>Then they caught hold of the yoke, and spilt the water, snatched off
one another's shawls, and began fighting. Gabriel, returning
<BR>from the fields, stopped to take his wife's part. Out rushed Iv&aacute;n
and his son and joined in with the rest. Iv&aacute;n was a strong
<BR>fellow, he scattered the whole lot of them, and pulled a handful of
hair out of Gabriel's beard. People came to see what was the
<BR>matter, and the fighters were separated with difficulty.

<P>That was how it all began.

<P>Gabriel wrapped the hair torn from his beard in a paper, and went to
the District Court to have the law of Iv&aacute;n. 'I didn't grow
<BR>my beard,' said he, 'for pockmarked Iv&aacute;n to pull it out!' And
his wife went bragging to the neighbours, saying they'd have Iv&aacute;n
<BR>condemned and sent to Siberia. And so the feud grew.

<P>The old man, from where he lay on the top of the oven, tried from the
very first to persuade them to make peace, but they
<BR>would not listen. He told them, 'It's a stupid thing you are after,
children, picking quarrels about such a paltry matter. Just think!
<BR>The whole thing began about an egg. The children may have taken it
-- well, what matter? What's the value of one egg? God
<BR>sends enough for all! And suppose your neighbour did say an unkind
word -- put it right; show her how to say a better one! If
<BR>there has been a fight -- well, such things will happen; we're all
sinners, but make it up, and let there be an end of it! If you
<BR>nurse your anger it will be worse for you yourselves.'

<P>But the younger folk would not listen to the old man. They thought his
words were mere senseless dotage. Iv&aacute;n would not
<BR>humble himself before his neighbour.

<P>'I never pulled his beard,' he said, 'he pulled the hair out himself.
But his son has burst all the fastenings on my shirt, and torn it. .
<BR>. . Look at it!'

<P>And Iv&aacute;n also went to law. They were tried by the Justice of
the Peace and by the District Court. While all this was going on,
<BR>the coupling-pin of Gabriel's cart disappeared. Gabriel's womenfolk
accused Ivan's son of having taken it. They said: 'We saw
<BR>him in the night go past our window, towards the cart; and a neighbour
says he saw him at the pub, offering the pin to the
<BR>landlord.'

<P>So they went to law about that. And at home not a day passed without
a quarrel or even a fight. The children, too, abused one
<BR>another, having learnt to do so from their elders; and when the women
happened to meet by the river-side, where they went to
<BR>rinse the clothes, their arms did not do as much wringing as their
tongues did nagging, and every word was a bad one.

<P>At first the peasants only slandered one another; but afterwards they
began in real earnest to snatch anything that lay handy, and
<BR>the children followed their example. Life became harder and harder
for them. Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f and Limping Gabriel kept suing
<BR>one another at the Village Assembly, and at the District Court, and
before the Justice of the Peace until all the judges were tired
<BR>of them. Now Gabriel got Iv&aacute;n fined or imprisoned; then Iv&aacute;n
did as much to Gabriel; and the more they spited each other the
<BR>angrier they grew -- like dogs that attack one another and get more
and more furious the longer they fight. You strike one dog
<BR>from behind, and it thinks it's the other dog biting him, and gets
still fiercer. So these peasants: they went to law, and one or
<BR>other of them was fined or locked up, but that only made them more
and more angry with each other. 'Wait a bit,' they said,
<BR>'and I'll make you pay for it.' And so it went on for six years. Only
the old man lying on the top of the oven kept telling them
<BR>again and again: 'Children, what are you doing? Stop all this paying
back; keep to your work, and don't bear malice -- it will be
<BR>better for you. The more you bear malice, the worse it will be.'

<P>But they would not listen to him.

<P>In the seventh year, at a wedding, Ivan's daughter-in-law held Gabriel
up to shame, accusing him of having been caught
<BR>horse-stealing. Gabriel was tipsy, and unable to contain his anger,
gave the woman such a blow that she was laid up for a
<BR>week; and she was pregnant at the time. Iv&aacute;n was delighted.
He went to the magistrate to lodge a complaint. 'Now I'll get rid of
<BR>my neighbour! He won't escape imprisonment, or exile to Siberia.' But
Ivan's wish was not fulfilled. The magistrate dismissed
<BR>the case. The woman was examined, but she was up and about and showed
no sign of any injury. Then Ivan went to the Justice
<BR>of the Peace, but he referred the business to the District Court. Ivan
bestirred himself: treated the clerk and the Elder of the
<BR>District Court to a gallon of liquor and got Gabriel condemned to be
flogged. The sentence was read out to Gabriel by the
<BR>clerk: 'The Court decrees that the peasant Gabriel Gord&eacute;yef
shall receive twenty lashes with a birch rod at the District Court.'

<P>Ivan too heard the sentence read, and looked at Gabriel to see how he
would take it. Gabriel grew as pale as a sheet, and
<BR>turned round and went out into the passage. Ivan followed him, meaning
to see to the horse, and he overheard Gabriel say,
<BR>'Very well! He will have my back flogged: that will make it burn; but
something of his may burn worse than that!'

<P>Hearing these words, Ivan at once went back into the Court, and said:
'Upright judges! He threatens to set my house on fire!
<BR>Listen: he said it in the presence of witnesses!'

<P>Gabriel was recalled. 'Is it true that you said this?'

<P>'I haven't said anything. Flog me, since you have the power. It seems
that I alone am to suffer, and all for being in the right,
<BR>while he is allowed to do as he likes.'

<P>Gabriel wished to say something more, but his lips and his cheeks quivered,
and he turned towards the wall. Even the officials
<BR>were frightened by his looks. 'He may do some mischief to himself or
to his neighbour,' thought they.

<P>Then the old Judge said: 'Look here, my men; you'd better be reasonable
and make it up. Was it right of you, friend Gabriel, to
<BR>strike a pregnant woman? It was lucky it passed off so well, but think
what might have happened! Was it right? You had better
<BR>confess and beg his pardon, and he will forgive you, and we will alter
the sentence.'

<P>The clerk heard these words, and remarked: 'That's impossible under
Statute 117. An agreement between the parties not
<BR>having been arrived at, a decision of the Court has been pronounced
and must be executed.'

<P>But the Judge would not listen to the clerk.

<P>'Keep your tongue still, my friend,' said he. 'The first of all laws
is to obey God, Who loves peace.' And the Judge began again
<BR>to persuade the peasants, but could not succeed. Gabriel would not
listen to him.

<P>'I shall be fifty next year,' said he, 'and have a married son, and
have never been flogged in my life, and now that pockmarked
<BR>Ivan has had me condemned to be flogged, and am I to go and ask his
forgiveness? No; I've borne enough. . . . Ivan shall have
<BR>cause to remember me!'

<P>Again Gabriel's voice quivered, and he could say no more, but turned
round and went out.

<P>It was seven miles from the Court to the village, and it was getting
late when Ivan reached home. He unharnessed his horse, put
<BR>it up for the night, and entered the cottage. No one was there. The
women had already gone to drive the cattle in, and the
<BR>young fellows were not yet back from the fields. Iv&aacute;n went in,
and sat down, thinking. He remembered how Gabriel had
<BR>listened to the sentence, and how pale he had become, and how he had
turned to the wall; and Ivan's heart grew heavy. He
<BR>thought how he himself would feel if he were sentenced, and he pitied
Gabriel. Then he heard his old father up on the oven
<BR>cough, and saw him sit up, lower his legs, and scramble down. The old
man dragged himself slowly to a seat, and sat down. He
<BR>was quite tired out with the exertion, and coughed a long time till
he had cleared his throat. Then, leaning against the table, he
<BR>said: 'Well, has he been condemned?'

<P>'Yes, to twenty strokes with the rods,' answered Iv&aacute;n.

<P>The old man shook his head.

<P>'A bad business,' said he. 'You are doing wrong, Iv&aacute;n! Ah! it's
very bad -- not for him so much as for yourself! . . . Well, they'll
<BR>flog him: but will that do you any good?'

<P>'He'll not do it again,' said Iv&aacute;n.

<P>'What is it he'll not do again? What has he done worse than you?'

<P>'Why, think of the harm he has done me!' said Iv&aacute;n. 'He nearly
killed my wife, and now he's threatening to burn us up. Am I to
<BR>thank him for it?'

<P>The old man sighed, and said: 'You go about the wide world, Iv&aacute;n,
while I am lying on the oven all these years, so you think
<BR>you see everything, and that I see nothing. . . . Ah, lad! It's you
that don't see; malice blinds you. Others' sins are before your
<BR>eyes, but your own are behind your back. "He's acted badly!" What a
thing to say! If he were the only one to act badly, how
<BR>could strife exist? Is strife among men ever bred by one alone? Strife
is always between two. His badness you see, but your
<BR>own you don't. If he were bad, but you were good, there would be no
strife. Who pulled the hair out of his beard? Who spoilt
<BR>his haystack? Who dragged him to the law court? Yet you put it all
on him! You live a bad life yourself, that's what is wrong!
<BR>It's not the way I used to live, lad, and it's not the way I taught
you. Is that the way his old father and I used to live? How did
<BR>we live? Why, as neighbours should! If he happened to run out of flour,
one of the women would come across: "Uncle Trol, we
<BR>want some flour." "Go to the barn, dear," I'd say: "take what you need."
If he'd no one to take his horses to pasture, "Go, Iv&aacute;n,"
<BR>I'd say, "and look after his horses." And if I was short of anything,
I'd go to him. "Uncle Gord&eacute;y," I'd say, "I want so-and-so!"
<BR>"Take it Uncle Trol!" That's how it was between us, and we had an easy
time of it. But now? . . . That soldier the other day
<BR>was telling us about the fight at Plevna[9]. Why, there's war between
you worse than at Plevna! Is that living? . . . What a sin it
<BR>is! You are a man and master of the house; it's you who will have to
answer. What are you teaching the women and the
<BR>children? To snarl and snap? Why, the other day your Tar&aacute;ska
-- that greenhorn -- was swearing at neighbour Irena, calling her
<BR>names; and his mother listened and laughed. Is that right? It is you
will have to answer. Think of your soul. Is this all as it should
<BR>be? You throw a word at me, and I give you two in return; you give
me a blow, and I give you two. No, lad! Christ, when He
<BR>walked on earth, taught us fools something very different. . . . If
you get a hard word from any one, keep silent, and his own
<BR>conscience will accuse him. That is what our Lord taught. If you get
a slap, turn the other cheek. "Here, beat me, if that's what I
<BR>deserve!" And his own conscience will rebuke him. He will soften, and
will listen to you. That's the way He taught us, not to be
<BR>proud! . . . Why don't you speak? Isn't it as I say?'

<P>Iv&aacute;n sat silent and listened.

<P>The old man coughed, and having with difficulty cleared his throat,
began again: 'You think Christ taught us wrong? Why, it's all
<BR>for our own good. Just think of your earthly life; are you better off,
or worse, since this Plevna began among you? Just reckon
<BR>up what you've spent on all this law business -- what the driving backwards
and forwards and your food on the way have cost
<BR>you! What fine fellows your sons have grown; you might live and get
on well; but now your means are lessening. And why? All
<BR>because of this folly; because of your pride. You ought to be ploughing
with your lads, and do the sowing yourself; but the fiend
<BR>carries you off to the judge, or to some pettifogger or other. The
ploughing is not done in time, nor the sowing, and mother
<BR>earth can't bear properly. Why did the oats fail this year? When did
you sow them? When you came back from town! And
<BR>what did you gain? A burden for your own shoulders. . . . Eh, lad,
think of your own business! Work with your boys in the field
<BR>and at home, and if some one offends you, forgive him, as God wished
you to. Then life will be easy, and your heart will always
<BR>be light.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n remained silent.

<P>'Iv&aacute;n, my boy, hear your old father! Go and harness the roan,
and go at once to the Government office; put an end to all this
<BR>affair there; and in the morning go and make it up with Gabriel in
God's name, and invite him to your house for to-morrow's
<BR>holiday' (it was the eve of the Virgin's Nativity). 'Have tea ready,
and get a bottle of v&oacute;dka and put an end to this wicked
<BR>business, so that there should not be any more of it in future, and
tell the women and children to do the same.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n sighed, and thought, 'What he says is true,' and his heart
grew lighter. Only he did not know how, now, to begin to put
<BR>matters right.

<P>But again the old man began, as if he had guessed what was in Ivan's
mind.

<P>'Go, Iv&aacute;n, don't put it off! Put out the fire before it spreads,
or it will be too late.'

<P>The old man was going to say more, but before he could do so the women
came in, chattering like magpies. The news that
<BR>Gabriel was sentenced to be flogged, and of his threat to set fire
to the house, had already reached them. They had heard all
<BR>about it and added to it something of their own, and had again had
a row, in the pasture, with the women of Gabriel's
<BR>household. They began telling how Gabriel's daughter-in-law threatened
a fresh action: Gabriel had got the right side of the
<BR>examining magistrate, who would now turn the whole affair upside down;
and the schoolmaster was writing out another petition,
<BR>to the Tsar himself this time, about Iv&aacute;n; and everything was
in the petition -- all about the coupling-pin and the kitchen-garden
<BR>-- so that half of Ivan's homestead would be theirs soon. Iv&aacute;n
heard what they were saying, and his heart grew cold again, and
<BR>he gave up the thought of making peace with Gabriel.

<P>In a farmstead there is always plenty for the master to do. Iv&aacute;n
did not stop to talk to the women, but went out to the
<BR>threshing-floor and to the barn. By the time he had tidied up there,
the sun had set and the young fellows had returned from the
<BR>field. They had been ploughing the field for the winter crops with
two horses. Iv&aacute;n met them, questioned them about their work,
<BR>helped to put everything in its place, set a torn horse-collar aside
to be mended, and was going to put away some stakes under
<BR>the barn, but it had grown quite dusk, so he decided to leave them
where they were till next day. Then he gave the cattle their
<BR>food, opened the gate, let out the horses. Tar&aacute;s was to take
to pasture for the night, and again closed the gate and barred it.
<BR>'Now,' thought he, 'I'll have my supper, and then to bed.' He took
the horse-collar and entered the hut. By this time he had
<BR>forgotten about Gabriel and about what his old father had been saying
to him. But, just as he took hold of the door-handle to
<BR>enter the passage, he heard his neighbour on the other side of the
fence cursing somebody in a hoarse voice: 'What the devil is
<BR>he good for?' Gabriel was saying. 'He's only fit to be killed!' At
these words all Ivan's former bitterness towards his neighbour
<BR>re-awoke. He stood listening while Gabriel scolded, and, when he stopped,
Iv&aacute;n went into the hut.

<P>There was a light inside; his daughter-in-law sat spinning, his wife
was getting supper ready, his eldest son was making straps
<BR>for bark shoes, his second sat near the table with a book, and Tar&aacute;s
was getting ready to go out to pasture the horses for the
<BR>night. Everything in the hut would have been pleasant and bright, but
for that plague -- a bad neighbour!

<P>Iv&aacute;n entered, sullen and cross; threw the cat down from the bench,
and scolded the women for putting the slop-pail in the
<BR>wrong place. He felt despondent, and sat down, frowning, to mend the
horse-collar. Gabriel's words kept ringing in his ears: his
<BR>threat at the law court, and what he had just been shouting in a hoarse
voice about some one who was 'only fit to be killed.'

<P>His wife gave Tar&aacute;s his supper, and, having eaten it, Tar&aacute;s
put on an old sheepskin and another coat, tied a sash round his
<BR>waist, took some bread with him, and went out to the horses. His eldest
brother was going to see him off, but Iv&aacute;n himself rose
<BR>instead, and went out into the porch. It had grown quite dark outside,
clouds had gathered, and the wind had risen. Iv&aacute;n went
<BR>down the steps, helped his boy to mount, started the foal after him,
and stood listening while Tar&aacute;s rode down the village and
<BR>was there joined by other lads with their horses. Iv&aacute;n waited
until they were all out of hearing. As he stood there by the gate he
<BR>could not get Gabriel's words out of his head: 'Mind that something
of yours does not burn worse!'

<P>'He is desperate,' thought Iv&aacute;n. 'Everything is dry, and it's
windy weather besides. He'll come up at the back somewhere, set
<BR>fire to something, and be off. He'll burn the place and escape scot
free, the villain! . . . There now, if one could but catch him in
<BR>the act, he'd not get off then!' And the thought fixed itself so firmly
in his mind that he did not go up the steps but went out into
<BR>the street and round the corner. I'll just walk round the buildings;
who can tell what he's after?' And Iv&aacute;n, stepping softly,
<BR>passed out of the gate. As soon as he reached the corner, he looked
round along the fence, and seemed to see something
<BR>suddenly move at the opposite corner, as if some one had come out and
disappeared again. Iv&aacute;n stopped, and stood quietly,
<BR>listening and looking. Everything was still; only the leaves of the
willows fluttered in the wind, and the straws of the thatch
<BR>rustled. At first it seemed pitch dark, but, when his eyes had grown
used to the darkness, he could see the far corner, and a
<BR>plough that lay there, and the eaves. He looked a while, but saw no
one.

<P>'I suppose it was a mistake,' thought Iv&aacute;n; 'but still I will
go round,' and Iv&aacute;n went stealthily along by the shed. Iv&aacute;n
stepped so
<BR>softly in his bark shoes that he did not hear his own footsteps. As
he reached the far corner, something seemed to flare up for a
<BR>moment near the plough and to vanish again. Iv&aacute;n felt as if
struck to the heart; and he stopped. Hardly had he stopped, when
<BR>something flared up more brightly in the same place, and he clearly
saw a man with a cap on his head, crouching down, with his
<BR>back towards him, lighting a bunch of straw he held in his hand. Iv&aacute;n's
heart fluttered within him like a bird. Straining every
<BR>nerve, he approached with great strides, hardly feeling his legs under
him. 'Ah,' thought Iv&aacute;n, 'now he won't escape! I'll catch
<BR>him in the act!'

<P>Iv&aacute;n was still some distance off, when suddenly he saw a bright
light, but not in the same place as before, and not a small flame.
<BR>The thatch had flared up at the eaves, the flames were reaching up
to the roof, and, standing beneath it, Gabriel's whole figure
<BR>was clearly visible.

<P>Like a hawk swooping down on a lark, Iv&aacute;n rushed at Limping Gabriel.
'Now I'll have him; he shan't escape me!' thought Iv&aacute;n.
<BR>But Gabriel must have heard his steps, and (however he managed it)
glancing round, he scuttled away past the barn like a hare.

<P>'You shan't escape!' shouted Iv&aacute;n, darting after him.

<P>Just as he was going to seize Gabriel, the latter dodged him; but Iv&aacute;n
managed to catch the skirt of Gabriel's coat. It tore right
<BR>off, and Iv&aacute;n fell down. He recovered his feet, and shouting,
'Help! Seize him! Thieves! Murder!' ran on again. But meanwhile
<BR>Gabriel had reached his own gate. There Iv&aacute;n overtook him and
was about to seize him, when something struck Iv&aacute;n a stunning
<BR>blow, as though a stone had hit his temple, quite deafening him. It
was Gabriel who, seizing an oak wedge that lay near the gate,
<BR>had struck out with all his might.

<P>Iv&aacute;n was stunned; sparks flew before his eyes, then all grew
dark and he staggered. When he came to his senses Gabriel was
<BR>no longer there: it was as light as day, and from the side where his
homestead was something roared and crackled like an
<BR>engine at work. Iv&aacute;n turned round and saw that his back shed
was all ablaze, and the side shed had also caught fire, and flames
<BR>and smoke and bits of burning straw mixed with the smoke, were being
driven towards his hut.

<P>'What is this, friends? . . .' cried Iv&aacute;n, lifting his arms and
striking his thighs.' Why, all I had to do was just to snatch it out from
<BR>under the eaves and trample on it! What is this, friends? . . .' he
kept repeating. He wished to shout, but his breath failed him;
<BR>his voice was gone. He wanted to run, but his legs would not obey him,
and got in each other's way. He moved slowly, but
<BR>again staggered and again his breath failed. He stood still till he
had regained breath, and then went on. Before he had got round
<BR>the back shed to reach the fire, the side shed was also all ablaze;
and the corner of the hut and the covered gateway had caught
<BR>fire as well. The flames were leaping out of the hut, and it was impossible
to get into the yard. A large crowd had collected, but
<BR>nothing could be done. The neighbours were carrying their belongings
out of their own houses, and driving the cattle out of their
<BR>own sheds. After Ivan's house, Gabriel's also caught fire, then, the
wind rising, the flames spread to the other side of the street
<BR>and half the village was burnt down.

<P>At Ivan's house they barely managed to save his old father; and the
family escaped in what they had on; everything else, except
<BR>the horses that had been driven out to pasture for the night, was lost;
all the cattle, the fowls on their perches, the carts, ploughs,
<BR>and harrows, the women's trunks with their clothes, and the grain in
the granaries -- all were burnt up!

<P>At Gabriel's, the cattle were driven out, and a few things saved from
his house.

<P>The fire lasted all night. Iv&aacute;n stood in front of his homestead
and kept repeating, 'What is this? . . . Friends! . . . One need only
<BR>have pulled it out and trampled on it!' But when the roof fell in,
Iv&aacute;n rushed into the burning place, and seizing a charred beam,
<BR>tried to drag it out. The women saw him, and called him back; but he
pulled out the beam, and was going in again for another
<BR>when he lost his footing and fell among the flames. Then his son made
his way in after him and dragged him out. Iv&aacute;n had singed
<BR>his hair and beard and burnt his clothes and scorched his hands, but
he felt nothing. 'His grief has stupefied him,' said the
<BR>people. The fire was burning itself out, but Iv&aacute;n still stood
repeating: 'Friends! . . . What is this? . . . One need only have pulled
<BR>it out!'

<P>In the morning the village Elder's son came to fetch Iv&aacute;n.

<P>'Daddy Iv&aacute;n, your father is dying! He has sent for you to say
good-bye.'

<P>Iv&aacute;n had forgotten about his father, and did not understand what
was being said to him.

<P>'What father?' he said. 'Whom has he sent for?'

<P>'He sent for you, to say good-bye; he is dying in our cottage! Come
along, daddy Iv&aacute;n,' said the Elder's son, pulling him by the
<BR>arm; and Iv&aacute;n followed the lad.

<P>When he was being carried out of the hut, some burning straw had fallen
on to the old man and burnt him, and he had been
<BR>taken to the village Elder's in the farther part of the village, which
the fire did not reach.

<P>When Iv&aacute;n came to his father, there was only the Elder's wife
in the hut, besides some little children on the top of the oven. All
<BR>the rest were still at the fire. The old man, who was lying on a bench
holding a wax candle[10] in his hand, kept turning his eyes
<BR>towards the door. When his son entered, he moved a little. The old
woman went up to him and told him that his son had come.
<BR>He asked to have him brought nearer. Iv&aacute;n came closer.

<P>'What did I tell you, Iv&aacute;n?' began the old man 'Who has burnt
down the village?'

<P>'It was he, father!' Iv&aacute;n answered. 'I caught him in the act.
I saw him shove the firebrand into the thatch. I might have pulled
<BR>away the burning straw and stamped it out, and then nothing would have
happened.'

<P>'Iv&aacute;n,' said the old man, 'I am dying, and you in your turn will
have to face death. Whose is the sin?'

<P>Iv&aacute;n gazed at his father in silence, unable to utter a word.

<P>'Now, before God, say whose is the sin? What did I tell you?'

<P>Only then Iv&aacute;n came to his senses and understood it all. He sniffed
and said, 'Mine, father!' And he fell on his knees before his
<BR>father, saying, 'Forgive me, father; I am guilty before you and before
God.'

<P>The old man moved his hands, changed the candle from his right hand
to his left, and tried to lift his right hand to his forehead to
<BR>cross himself, but could not do it, and stopped.

<P>'Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!' said he, and again he turned his
eyes towards his son.

<P>'Iv&aacute;n! I say, Iv&aacute;n!'

<P>'What, father?'

<P>'What must you do now?'

<P>Iv&aacute;n was weeping.

<P>'I don't know how we are to live now, father!' he said.

<P>The old man closed his eyes, moved his lips as if to gather strength,
and opening his eyes again, said: 'You'll manage. If you
<BR>obey God's will, you'll manage!' He paused, then smiled, and said:
'Mind, Iv&aacute;n! Don't tell who started the fire! Hide another
<BR>man's sin, and God will forgive two of yours!' And the old man took
the candle in both hands and, folding them on his breast,
<BR>sighed, stretched out, and died.

<P>Iv&aacute;n did not say anything against Gabriel, and no one knew what
had caused the fire.

<P>And Ivan's anger against Gabriel passed away, and Gabriel wondered that
Iv&aacute;n did not tell anybody. At first Gabriel felt afraid,
<BR>but after awhile he got used to it. The men left off quarrelling, and
then their families left off also. While rebuilding their huts,
<BR>both families lived in one house; and when the village was rebuilt
and they might have moved farther apart, Iv&aacute;n and Gabriel
<BR>built next to each other, and remained neighbours as before.

<P>They lived as good neighbours should. Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f
remembered his old father's command to obey God's law, and quench
<BR>a fire at the first spark; and if any one does him an injury he now
tries not to revenge himself, but rather to set matters right
<BR>again; and if any one gives him a bad word, instead of giving a worse
in return, he tries to teach the other not to use evil words;
<BR>and so he teaches his womenfolk and children. And Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f
has got on his feet again, and now lives better even than
<BR>he did before.
