<P>[The adventure here narrated is one that happened to Tolstoy himself
in 1858. More than twenty years later he gave up hunting,
<BR>on humanitarian grounds.]

<P>WE were out on a bear-hunting expedition. My comrade had shot at a bear,
but only gave him a flesh-wound. There were
<BR>traces of blood on the snow, but the bear had got away.

<P>We all collected in a group in the forest, to decide whether we ought
to go after the bear at once, or wait two or three days till
<BR>he should settle down again. We asked the peasant bear-drivers whether
it would be possible to get round the bear that day.

<P>'No. It's impossible,' said an old bear-driver. 'You must let the bear
quiet down. In five days' time it will be possible to surround
<BR>him; but if you followed him now, you would only frighten him away,
and he would not settle down.'

<P>But a young bear-driver began disputing with the old man, saying that
it was quite possible to get round the bear now.

<P>'On such snow as this,' said he, 'he won't go far, for he is a fat bear.
He will settle down before evening; or, if not, I can
<BR>overtake him on snowshoes.'

<P>The comrade I was with was against following up the bear, and advised
waiting. But I said:

<P>'We need not argue. You do as you like, but I will follow up the track
with Damian. If we get round the bear, all right. If not,
<BR>we lose nothing. It is still early, and there is nothing else for us
to do to-day.'

<P>So it was arranged.

<P>The others went back to the sledges, and returned to the village. Damian
and I took some bread, and remained behind in the
<BR>forest.

<P>When they had all left us, Damian and I examined our guns, and after
tucking the skirts of our warm coats into our belts, we
<BR>started off, following the bear's tracks.

<P>The weather was fine, frosty and calm; but it was hard work snow-shoeing.
The snow was deep and soft: it had not caked
<BR>together at all in the forest, and fresh snow had fallen the day before,
so that our snow-shoes sank six inches deep in the snow,
<BR>and sometimes more.

<P>The bear's tracks were visible from a distance, and we could see how
he had been going; sometimes sinking in up to his belly
<BR>and ploughing up the snow as he went. At first, while under large trees,
we kept in sight of his track; but when it turned into a
<BR>thicket of small firs, Damian stopped.

<P>'We must leave the trail now,' said he. 'He has probably settled somewhere
here. You can see by the snow that he has been
<BR>squatting down. Let us leave the track and go round; but we must go
quietly. Don't shout or cough, or we shall frighten him
<BR>away.'

<P>Leaving the track, therefore, we turned off to the left. But when we
had gone about five hundred yards, there were the bear's
<BR>traces again right before us. We followed them, and they brought us
out on to the road. There we stopped, examining the road
<BR>to see which way the bear had gone. Here and there in the snow were
prints of the bear's paw, claws and all, and here and
<BR>there the marks of a peasant's bark shoes. The bear had evidently gone
towards the village.

<P>As we followed the road, Damian said:

<P>'It's no use watching the road now. We shall see where he has turned
off, to right or left, by the marks in the soft snow at the
<BR>side. He must have turned off somewhere; for he won't have gone on
to the village.'

<P>We went along the road for nearly a mile, and then saw, ahead of us,
the bear's track turning off the road. We examined it.
<BR>How strange! It was a bear's track right enough, only not going from
the road into the forest, but from the forest on to the road!
<BR>The toes were pointing towards the road.

<P>'This must be another bear,' I said.

<P>Damian looked at it, and considered a while.

<P>'No,' said he. 'It's the same one. He's been playing tricks, and walked
backwards when he left the road.'

<P>We followed the track, and found it really was so! The bear had gone
some ten steps backwards, and then, behind a fir tree,
<BR>had turned round and gone straight ahead. Damian stopped and said:

<P>'Now, we are sure to get round him. There is a marsh ahead of us, and
he must have settled down there. Let us go round it.'

<P>We began to make our way round, through a fir thicket. I was tired out
by this time, and it had become still more difficult to get
<BR>along. Now I glided on to juniper bushes and caught my snow-shoes in
them, now a tiny fir tree appeared between my feet, or,
<BR>from want of practise, my snow-shoes slipped off; and now I came upon
a stump or a log hidden by the snow. I was getting
<BR>very tired, and was drenched with perspiration; and I took off my fur
cloak. And there was Damian all the time, gliding along as
<BR>if in a boat, his snowshoes moving as if of their own accord, never
catching against anything, nor slipping off. He even took my
<BR>fur and slung it over his shoulder, and still kept urging me on.

<P>We went on for two more miles, and came out on the other side of the
marsh. I was lagging behind. My snow-shoes kept
<BR>slipping off, and my feet stumbled. Suddenly Damian, who was ahead
of me, stopped and waved his arm. When I came up to
<BR>him, he bent down, pointing with his hand, and whispered:

<P>'Do you see the magpie chattering above that undergrowth? It scents
the bear from afar. That is where he must be.'

<P>We turned off and went on for more than another half-mile, and presently
we came on to the old track again. We had,
<BR>therefore, been right round the bear who was now within the track we
had left. We stopped, and I took off my cap and
<BR>loosened all my clothes. I was as hot as in a steam bath, and as wet
as a drowned rat. Damian too was flushed, and wiped his
<BR>face with his sleeve.

<P>'Well, sir,' he said, 'we have done our job, and now we must have a
rest.'

<P>The evening glow already showed red through the forest. We took off
our snow-shoes and sat down on them, and got some
<BR>bread and salt out of our bags. First I ate some snow, and then some
bread; and the bread tasted so good, that I thought I had
<BR>never in my life had any like it before. We sat there resting until
it began to grow dusk, and then I asked Damian if it was far to
<BR>the village.

<P>'Yes,' he said. 'It must be about eight miles. We will go on there to-night,
but now we must rest. Put on your fur coat, sir, or
<BR>you'll be catching cold.'

<P>Damian flattened down the snow, and breaking off some fir branches made
a bed of them. We lay down side by side, resting
<BR>our heads on our arms. I do not remember how I fell asleep. Two hours
later I woke up, hearing something crack.

<P>I had slept so soundly that I did not know where I was. I looked around
me. How wonderful! I was in some sort of a hall, all
<BR>glittering and white with gleaming pillars, and when I looked up I
saw, through delicate white tracery, a vault, raven black and
<BR>studded with coloured lights. After a good look, I remembered that
we were in the forest, and that what I took for a hall and
<BR>pillars, were trees covered with snow and hoar-frost, and the coloured
lights were stars twinkling between the branches.

<P>Hoar-frost had settled in the night; all the twigs were thick with it,
Damian was covered with it, it was on my fur coat, and it
<BR>dropped down from the trees. I woke Damian, and we put on our snowshoes
and started. It was very quiet in the forest. No
<BR>sound was heard but that of our snow-shoes pushing through the soft
snow; except when now and then a tree, cracked by the
<BR>frost, made the forest resound. Only once we heard the sound of a living
creature. Something rustled close to us, and then
<BR>rushed away. I felt sure it was the bear, but when we went to the spot
whence the sound had come, we found the footmarks of
<BR>hares, and saw several young aspen trees with their bark gnawed. We
had startled some hares while they were feeding.

<P>We came out on the road, and followed it, dragging our snow-shoes behind
us. It was easy walking now. Our snow-shoes
<BR>clattered as they slid behind us from side to side of the hard-trodden
road. The snow creaked under our boots, and the cold
<BR>hoar-frost settled on our faces like down. Seen through the branches,
the stars seemed to be running to meet us, now twinkling,
<BR>now vanishing, as if the whole sky were on the move.

<P>I found my comrade sleeping, but woke him up, and related how we had
got round the bear. After telling our peasant host to
<BR>collect beaters for the morning, we had supper and lay down to sleep.

<P>I was so tired that I could have slept on till midday, if my comrade
had not roused me. I jumped up, and saw that he was
<BR>already dressed, and busy doing something to his gun.

<P>'Where is Damian?' said I.

<P>'In the forest, long ago. He has already been over the tracks you made,
and been back here, and now he has gone to look after
<BR>the beaters.'

<P>I washed and dressed, and loaded my guns; and then we got into a sledge,
and started.

<P>The sharp frost still continued. It was quiet, and the sun could not
be seen. There was a thick mist above us, and hoar-frost still
<BR>covered everything.

<P>After driving about two miles along the road, as we came near the forest,
we saw a cloud of smoke rising from a hollow, and
<BR>presently reached a group of peasants, both men and women, armed with
cudgels.

<P>We got out and went up to them. The men sat roasting potatoes, and laughing
and talking with the women.

<P>Damian was there too; and when we arrived the people got up, and Damian
led them away to place them in the circle we had
<BR>made the day before. They went along in single file, men and women,
thirty in all. The snow was so deep that we could only see
<BR>them from their waists upwards. They turned into the forest, and my
friend and I followed in their track.

<P>Though they had trodden a path, walking was difficult, but, on the other
hand, it was impossible to fall: it was like walking
<BR>between two walls of snow.

<P>We went on in this way for nearly half a mile, when all at once we saw
Damian coming from another direction -- running
<BR>towards us on his snowshoes, and beckoning us to join him. We went
towards him, and he showed us where to stand. I took
<BR>my place, and looked round me.

<P>To my left were tall fir trees, between the trunks of which I could
see a good way, and, like a black patch just visible behind the
<BR>trees, I could see a beater. In front of me was a thicket of young
firs, about as high as a man, their branches weighed down and
<BR>stuck together with snow. Through this copse ran a path thickly covered
with snow, and leading straight up to where I stood.
<BR>The thicket stretched away to the right of me, and ended in a small
glade, where I could see Damian placing my comrade.

<P>I examined both my guns, and considered where I had better stand. Three
steps behind me was a tall fir.

<P>'That's where I'll stand,' thought I, 'and then I can lean my second
gun against the tree'; and I moved towards the tree, sinking
<BR>up to my knees in the snow at each step. I trod the snow down, and
made a clearance about a yard square, to stand on. One
<BR>gun I kept in my hand; the other, ready cocked, I placed leaning up
against the tree. Then I unsheathed and replaced my
<BR>dagger, to make sure that I could draw it easily in case of need.

<P>Just as I had finished these preparations, I heard Damian shouting in
the forest:

<P>'He's up! He's up!'

<P>And as soon as Damian shouted, the peasants round the circle all replied
in their different voices.

<P>'Up, up, up! Ou! Ou! Ou!' shouted the men.

<P>'Ay! Ay! Ay!' screamed the women in high. pitched tones.

<P>The bear was inside the circle, and as Damian drove him on, the people
all round kept shouting. Only my friend and I stood
<BR>silent and motionless, waiting for the bear to come towards us. As
I stood gazing and listening, my heart beat violently. I
<BR>trembled, holding my gun fast.

<P>'Now now,' I thought. 'He will come suddenly. I shall aim, fire, and
he will drop -- '

<P>Suddenly, to my left, but at a distance, I heard something falling on
the snow. I looked between the tall fir trees, and, some fifty
<BR>paces off, behind the trunks, saw something big and black. I took aim
and waited, thinking:

<P>'Won't he come any nearer?'

<P>As I waited I saw him move his ears, turn, and go back; and then I caught
a glimpse of the whole of him in profile. He was an
<BR>immense brute. In my excitement, I fired, and heard my bullet go 'flop'
against a tree. Peering through the smoke, I saw my bear
<BR>scampering back into the circle, and disappearing among the trees.

<P>'Well,' thought I. 'My chance is lost. He won't come back to me. Either
my comrade will shoot him, or he will escape through
<BR>the line of beaters. In any case he won't give me another chance.'

<P>I reloaded my gun, however, and again stood listening. The peasants
were shouting all round, but to the right, not far from
<BR>where my comrade stood, I heard a woman screaming in a frenzied voice:
'Here he is! Here he is! Come here, come here! Oh!
<BR>Oh! Ay! Ay!'

<P>Evidently she could see the bear. I had given up expecting him, and
was looking to the right at my comrade. All at once I saw
<BR>Damian with a stick in his hand, and without his snow-shoes, running
along a footpath towards my friend. He crouched down
<BR>beside him, pointing his stick as if aiming at something, and then
I saw my friend raise his gun and aim in the same direction.
<BR>Crack! He fired.

<P>'There,' thought I. 'He has killed him.'

<P>But I saw that my comrade did not run towards the bear. Evidently he
had missed him, or the shot had not taken full effect.

<P>'The bear will get away,' I thought. 'He will go back, but he won't
come a second time towards me. -- But what is that?'

<P>Something was coming towards me like a whirlwind, snorting as it came;
and I saw the snow flying up quite near me. I glanced
<BR>straight before me, and there was the bear, rushing along the path
through the thicket right at me, evidently beside himself with
<BR>fear. He was hardly half a dozen paces off, and I could see the whole
of him -- his black chest and enormous head with a
<BR>reddish patch. There he was, blundering straight at me, and scattering
the snow about as he came. I could see by his eyes that
<BR>he did not see me, but, mad with fear, was rushing blindly along; and
his path led him straight at the tree under which I was
<BR>standing. I raised my gun and fired. He was almost upon me now, and
I saw that I had missed. My bullet had gone past him,
<BR>and he did not even hear me fire, but still came headlong towards me.
I lowered my gun, and fired again, almost touching his
<BR>head. Crack! I had hit, but not killed him!

<P>He raised his head, and laying his ears back, came at me, showing his
teeth.

<P>I snatched at my other gun, but almost before I had touched it, he had
down at me and, knocking me over into the snow, had
<BR>passed right over me.

<P>'Thank goodness, he has left me,' thought I.

<P>I tried to rise, but something pressed me down, and prevented my getting
up. The bear's rush had carried him past me, but he
<BR>had turned back, and had fallen on me with the whole weight of his
body. I felt something heavy weighing me down, and
<BR>something warm above my face, and I realized that he was drawing my
whole face into his mouth. My nose was already in it,
<BR>and I felt the heat of it, and smelt his blood. He was pressing my
shoulders down with his paws so that I could not move: all I
<BR>could do was to draw my head down towards my chest away from his mouth,
trying to free my nose and eyes, while he tried to
<BR>get his teeth into them. Then I felt that he had seized my forehead
just under the hair with the teeth of his lower jaw, and the
<BR>flesh below my eyes with his upper jaw, and was closing his teeth.
It was as if my face were being cut with knives. I struggled
<BR>to get away, while he made haste to close his jaws like a dog gnawing.
I managed to twist my face away, but he began drawing
<BR>it again into his mouth.

<P>'Now,' thought I, 'my end has come!'

<P>Then I felt the weight lifted, and looking up, I saw that he was no
longer there. He had jumped off me and run away.

<P>When my comrade and Damian had seen the bear knock me down and begin
worrying me, they rushed to the rescue. My
<BR>comrade, in his haste, blundered, and instead of following the trodden
path, ran into the deep snow and fell down. While he
<BR>was struggling out of the snow, the bear was gnawing at me. But Damian
just as he was, without a gun, and with only a stick in
<BR>his hand, rushed along the path shouting:

<P>'He's eating the master! He's eating the master!'

<P>And as he ran, he called to the bear:

<P>'Oh you idiot! What are you doing? Leave off! Leave off!'

<P>The bear obeyed him, and leaving me ran away. When I rose, there was
as much blood on the snow as if a sheep had been
<BR>killed, and the flesh hung in rags above my eyes, though in my excitement
I felt no pain.

<P>My comrade had come up by this time, and the other people collected
round: they looked at my wound, and put snow on it.
<BR>But I, forgetting about my wounds, only asked:

<P>'Where's the bear? Which way has he gone?'

<P>Suddenly I heard:

<P>'Here he is! Here he is!'

<P>And we saw the bear again running at us. We seized our guns, but before
any one had time to fire he had run past. He had
<BR>grown ferocious, and wanted to gnaw me again, but seeing so many people
he took fright. We saw by his track that his head
<BR>was bleeding and we wanted to follow him up; but, as my wounds had
become very painful, we went, instead, to the town to
<BR>find a doctor.

<P>The doctor stitched up my wounds with silk, and they soon began to heal.

<P>A month later we went to hunt that bear again, but I did not get a chance
of finishing him. He would not come out of the circle,
<BR>but went round and round growling in a terrible voice.

<P>Damian killed him. The bear's lower jaw had been broken, and one of
his teeth knocked out by my bullet.

<P>He was a huge creature, and had splendid black fur.

<P>I had him stuffed, and he now lies in my room. The wounds on my forehead
healed up so that the scars can scarcely be seen.
