<P><B>(A FOLK-TALE LONG CURRENT IN THE REGION OF THE VOLGA)</B>

<P>EMELY&Aacute;N was a labourer and worked for a master. Crossing the
meadows one day on his way to work, he nearly trod on a
<BR>frog that jumped right in front of him, but he just managed to avoid
it. Suddenly he heard some one calling to him from behind.

<P>Emely&aacute;n looked round and saw a lovely lassie, who said to him:
'Why don't you get married, Emely&aacute;n?'

<P>'How can I marry, my lass?' said he. 'I have but the clothes I stand
up in, nothing more, and no one would have me for a husband.'

<P>'Take me for a wife,' said she.

<P>Emely&aacute;n liked the maid. 'I should be glad to,' said he, 'but
where and how could we live?'

<P>'Why trouble about that?' said the girl. 'One only has to work more
and sleep less, and one can clothe and feed oneself anywhere.'

<P>'Very well then, let us marry,' said Emely&aacute;n. 'Where shall we
go to?'

<P>'Let us go to town.'

<P>So Emely&aacute;n and the lass went to town, and she took him to a small
hut on the very edge of the town, and they married and began
<BR>housekeeping.

<P>One day the King, driving through the town, passed by Emely&aacute;n's
hut. Emely&aacute;n's wife came out to see the King. The King noticed
<BR>her and was quite surprised.

<P>'Where did such a beauty come from?' said he and stopping his carriage
he called Emely&aacute;n's wife and asked her: 'Who are you?'

<P>'The peasant Emely&aacute;n's wife,' said she.

<P>'Why did you, who are such a beauty, marry a peasant?' said the King.
'You ought to be a queen!'

<P>'Thank you for your kind words,' said she, 'but a peasant husband is
good enough for me.'

<P>The King talked to her awhile and then drove on. He returned to the
palace, but could not get Emely&aacute;n's wife out of his head. All
<BR>night he did not sleep, but kept thinking how to get her for himself.
He could think of no way of doing it, so he called his servants
<BR>and told them they must find a way.

<P>The King's servants said: 'Command Emely&aacute;n to come to the palace
to work, and we will work him so hard that he will die. His
<BR>wife will be left a widow, and then you can take her for yourself.'

<P>The King followed their advice. He sent an order that Emely&aacute;n
should come to the palace as a workman and that he should live at
<BR>the palace, and his wife with him.

<P>The messengers came to Emely&aacute;n and gave him the King's message.
His wife said, 'Go, Emely&aacute;n; work all day, but come back
<BR>home at night.'

<P>So Emely&aacute;n went, and when he got to the palace the King's steward
asked him, 'Why have you come alone, without your wife?'

<P>'Why should I drag her about?' said Emely&aacute;n. 'She has a house
to live in.'

<P>At the King's palace they gave Emely&aacute;n work enough for two. He
began the job not hoping to finish it; but when evening came, lo
<BR>and behold! it was all done. The steward saw that it was finished,
and set him four times as much for next day.

<P>Emely&aacute;n went home. Everything there was swept and tidy; the oven
was heated, his supper was cooked and ready, and his wife
<BR>sat by the table sewing and waiting for his return. She greeted him,
laid the table, gave him to eat and drink, and then began to ask
<BR>him about his work.

<P>'Ah!' said he, 'it's a bad business: they give me tasks beyond my strength,
and want to kill me with work.'

<P>'Don't fret about the work,' said she, 'don't look either before or
behind to see how much you have done or how much there is left
<BR>to do; only keep on working and all will be right.'

<P>So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. Next morning he went to work again
and worked without once looking round. And, lo and behold!
<BR>by the evening it was all done, and before dark he came home for the
night.

<P>Again and again they increased Emely&aacute;n's work, but he always
got through it in good time and went back to his hut to sleep. A
<BR>week passed, and the King's servants saw they could not crush him with
rough work so they tried giving him work that required
<BR>skill. But this, also, was of no avail. Carpentering, and masonry,
and roofing, whatever they set him to do, Emely&aacute;n had it ready in
<BR>time, and went home to his wife at night. So a second week passed.

<P>Then the King called his servants and said: 'Am I to feed you for nothing?
Two weeks have gone, and I don't see that you have
<BR>done anything. You were going to tire Emely&aacute;n out with work,
but I see from my windows how he goes home every evening --
<BR>singing cheerfully! Do you mean to make a fool of me?'

<P>The King's servants began to excuse themselves. 'We tried our best to
wear him out with rough work,' they said, 'but nothing was
<BR>too hard for him; he cleared it all off as though he had swept it away
with a broom. There was no tiring him out. Then we set him
<BR>to tasks needing skill, which we did not think he was clever enough
to do, but he managed them all. No matter what one sets him,
<BR>he does it all, no one knows how. Either he or his wife must know some
spell that helps them. We ourselves are sick of him, and
<BR>wish to find a task he cannot master. We have now thought of setting
him to build a cathedral in a single day. Send for Emely&aacute;n,
<BR>and order him to build a cathedral in front of the palace in a single
day. Then, if he does not do it, let his head be cut off for
<BR>disobedience.'

<P>The King sent for Emely&aacute;n. 'Listen to my command,' said he: 'build
me a new cathedral on the square in front of my palace, and
<BR>have it ready by to-morrow evening. If you have it ready I will reward
you, but if not I will have your head cut off.'

<P>When Emely&aacute;n heard the King's command he turned away and went
home. 'My end is near,' thought he. And coming to his wife,
<BR>he said: 'Get ready, wife we must fly from here, or I shall be lost
by no fault of my own.'

<P>'What has frightened you so?' said she, 'and why should we run away?'

<P>'How can I help being frightened? The King has ordered me, to-morrow,
in a single day, to build him a cathedral. If I fail he will
<BR>cut my head off. There is only one thing to be done: we must fly while
there is yet time.'

<P>But his wife would not hear of it. 'The King has many soldiers,' said
she. 'They would catch us anywhere. We cannot escape from
<BR>him, but must obey him as long as strength holds out.'

<P>'How can I obey him when the task is beyond my strength?'

<P>'Eh, goodman, don't be downhearted. Eat your supper now, and go to sleep.
Rise early in the morning and all will get done.'

<P>So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. His wife roused him early next
day. 'Go quickly,' said she, 'and finish the cathedral. Here are nails
<BR>and a hammer; there is still enough work there for a day.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n went into the town, reached the palace square, and there
stood a large cathedral not quite finished. Emely&aacute;n set to work
<BR>to do what was needed, and by the evening all was ready.

<P>When the King awoke he looked out from his palace, and saw the cathedral,
and Emely&aacute;n going about driving in nails here and
<BR>there. And the King was not pleased to have the cathedral -- he was
annoyed at not being able to condemn Emely&aacute;n and take his
<BR>wife. Again he called his servants. 'Emely&aacute;n has done this task
also,' said the King, 'and there is no excuse for putting him to
<BR>death. Even this work was not too hard for him. You must find a more
cunning plan, or I will cut off your heads as well as his.'

<P>So his servants planned that Emely&aacute;n should be ordered to make
a river round the palace, with ships sailing on it. And the King
<BR>sent for Emely&aacute;n and set him this new task.

<P>'If,' said he, 'you could build a cathedral in one night, you can also
do this. To-morrow all must be ready. If not, I will have your
<BR>head off.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n was more downcast than before, and returned to his wife
sad at heart.

<P>'Why are you so sad?' said his wife. 'Has the King set you a fresh task?'

<P>Emely&aacute;n told her about it. 'We must fly,' said he.

<P>But his wife replied: 'There is no escaping the soldiers; they will
catch us wherever we go. There is nothing for it but to obey.'

<P>'How can I do it?' groaned Emely&aacute;n.

<P>'Eh! eh! goodman,' said she, 'don't be downhearted. Eat your supper
now, and go to sleep. Rise early, and all will get done in good
<BR>time.'

<P>So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. In the morning his wife woke him.
'Go,' said she 'to the palace -- all is ready. Only, near the
<BR>wharf in front of the palace, there is a mound left; take a spade and
level it.

<P>When the King awoke he saw a river where there had not been one; ships
were sailing up and down, and Emely&aacute;n was levelling a
<BR>mound with a spade. The King wondered, but was pleased neither with
the river nor with the ships, so vexed was he at not being
<BR>able to condemn Emely&aacute;n. 'There is no task,' thought he, 'that
he cannot manage. What is to be done?' And he called his servants
<BR>and again asked their advice.

<P>'Find some task,' said he, 'which Emely&aacute;n cannot compass. For
whatever we plan he fulfils, and I cannot take his wife from him.'

<P>The King's servants thought and thought, and at last devised a plan.
They came to the King and said: 'Send for Emely&aacute;n and say to
<BR>him: "Go to there, don't know where," and bring back "that, don't know
what." Then he will not be able to escape you. No matter
<BR>where he goes, you can say that he has not gone to the right place,
and no matter what he brings, you can say it is not the right
<BR>thing. Then you can have him beheaded and can take his wife.'

<P>The King was pleased. 'That is well thought of,' said he. So the King
sent for Emely&aacute;n and said to him: 'Go to "there, don't know
<BR>where," and bring back "that, don't know what." If you fail to bring
it, I will have you beheaded.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n returned to his wife and told her what the King had said.
His wife became thoughtful.

<P>'Well,' said she, 'they have taught the King how to catch you. Now we
must act warily.' So she sat and thought, and at last said to
<BR>her husband: 'You must go far, to our Grandam -- the old peasant woman,
the mother of soldiers -- and you must ask her aid. If
<BR>she helps you to anything, go straight to the palace with it, I shall
be there: I cannot escape them now. They will take me by force,
<BR>but it will not be for long. If you do everything as Grandam directs,
you will soon save me.'

<P>So the wife got her husband ready for the journey. She gave him a wallet,
and also a spindle. 'Give her this,' said she. 'By this
<BR>token she will know that you are my husband.' And his wife showed him
his road.

<P>Emely&aacute;n set off. He left the town behind, and came to where some
soldiers were being drilled. Emely&aacute;n stood and watched them.
<BR>After drill the soldiers sat down to rest. Then Emely&aacute;n went
up to them and asked: 'Do you know, brothers, the way to "there,
<BR>don't know where?" and how I can get "that, don't know what?"'

<P>The soldiers listened to him with surprise. 'Who sent you on this errand?'
said they

<P>'The King,' said he.

<P>'We ourselves,' said they, 'from the day we became soldiers, go we "don't
know where," and never yet have we got there; and we
<BR>seek we "don't know what," and cannot find it. We cannot help you.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n sat a while with the soldiers and then went on again.
He trudged many a mile, and at last came to a wood. In the wood
<BR>was a hut, and in the hut sat an old, old woman, the mother of peasant
soldiers, spinning flax and weeping. And as she spun she
<BR>did not put her fingers to her mouth to wet them with spittle, but
to her eyes to wet them with tears. When the old woman saw
<BR>Emely&aacute;n she cried out at him: 'Why have you come here?' Then
Emely&aacute;n gave her the spindle, and said his wife had sent it.

<P>The old woman softened at once, and began to question him. And Emely&aacute;n
told her his whole life: how he married the lass; how
<BR>they went to live in the town; how he had worked, and what he had done
at the palace; how he built the cathedral, and made a
<BR>river with ships on it, and how the King had now told him to go to
'there, don't know where, and bring back 'that, don't know what.'

<P>The Grandam listened to the end, and ceased weeping. She muttered to
herself: 'The time has surely come,' and said to him: 'All
<BR>right, my lad. Sit down now, and I will give you something to eat.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n ate, and then the Grandam told him what to do. 'Here,'
said she, 'is a ball of thread; roll it before you, and follow where it
<BR>goes. You must go far till you come right to the sea. When you get
there you will see a great city. Enter the city and ask for a
<BR>night's lodging at the furthest house. There look out for what you
are seeking.'

<P>'How shall I know it when I see it, Granny?' said he.

<P>'When you see something men obey more than father or mother, that is
it. Seize that, and take it to the King. When you bring it to
<BR>the King, he will say it is not right, and you must answer: "If it
is not the right thing it must be smashed," and you must beat it, and
<BR>carry it to the river, break it in pieces, and throw it into the water.
Then you will get your wife back and my tears will be dried.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n bade farewell to the Grandam and began rolling his ball
before him. It rolled and rolled until at last it reached the sea. By
<BR>the sea stood a great city, and at the further end of the city was
a big house. There Emely&aacute;n begged for a night's lodging, and was
<BR>granted it. He lay down to sleep, and in the morning awoke and heard
a father rousing his son to go and cut wood for the fire. But
<BR>the son did not obey. 'It is too early,' said he, 'there is time enough.'
Then Emely&aacute;n heard the mother say, 'Go, my son, your
<BR>father's bones ache; would you have him go himself? It is time to be
up!'

<P>But the son only murmured some words and fell asleep again. Hardly was
he asleep when something thundered and rattled in the
<BR>street. Up jumped the son and quickly putting on his clothes ran out
into the street. Up jumped Emely&aacute;n, too, and ran after him to
<BR>see what it was that a son obeys more than father or mother. What he
saw was a man walking along the street carrying, tied to
<BR>his stomach, a thing which he beat with sticks, and that it was that
rattled and thundered so, and that the son had obeyed. Emely&aacute;n
<BR>ran up and had a look at it. He saw it was round, like a small tub,
with a skin stretched over both ends, and he asked what it was
<BR>called.

<P>He was told, 'A drum.'

<P>'And is it empty?'

<P>'Yes, it is empty.'

<P>Emely&aacute;n was surprised. He asked them to give the thing to him,
but they would not. So Emely&aacute;n left off asking, and followed the
<BR>drummer. All day he followed, and when the drummer at last lay down
to sleep, Emely&aacute;n snatched the drum from him and ran
<BR>away with it.

<P>He ran and ran, till at last he got back to his own town. He went to
see his wife, but she was not at home. The day after he went
<BR>away, the King had taken her. So Emely&aacute;n went to the palace,
and sent in a message to the King: 'He has returned who went to
<BR>"there, don't know where," and he has brought with him "that, don't
know what."'

<P>They told the King, and the King said he was to come again next day.

<P>But Emely&aacute;n said, 'Tell the King I am here to-day, and have brought
what the King wanted. Let him come out to me, or I will go
<BR>in to him!'

<P>The King came out. 'Where have you been?' said he.

<P>Emely&aacute;n told him.

<P>'That's not the right place,' said the King. 'What have you brought?'

<P>Emely&aacute;n pointed to the drum, but the King did not look at it.

<P>'That is not it.'

<P>'If it is not the right thing,' said Emely&aacute;n, 'it must be smashed,
and may the devil take it!'

<P>And Emely&aacute;n left the palace, carrying the drum and beating it.
And as he beat it all the King's army ran out to follow Emely&aacute;n,
<BR>and they saluted him and waited his commands.

<P>The King, from his window, began to shout at his army telling them not
to follow Emely&aacute;n. They did not listen to what he said, but
<BR>all followed Emely&aacute;n.

<P>When the King saw that, he gave orders that Emely&aacute;n's wife should
be taken back to him, and he sent to ask Emely&aacute;n to give him
<BR>the drum.

<P>'It can't be done,' said Emely&aacute;n. 'I was told to smash it and
to throw the splinters into the river.'

<P>So Emely&aacute;n went down to the river carrying the drum, and the
soldiers followed him. When he reached the river bank Emely&aacute;n
<BR>smashed the drum to splinters, and threw the splinters into the stream.
And then all the soldiers ran away.

<P>Emely&aacute;n took his wife and went home with her. And after that
the King ceased to trouble him; and so they lived happily ever
<BR>after.
