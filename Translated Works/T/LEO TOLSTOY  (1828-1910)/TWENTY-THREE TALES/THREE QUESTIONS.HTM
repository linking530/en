<P>IT once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right
time to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people
<BR>to listen to, and whom to avoid, and, above all, if he always knew
what was the most important thing to do, he would never fail in
<BR>anything he might undertake.

<P>And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout
his kingdom that he would give a great reward to any
<BR>one who would teach him what was the right time for every action, and
who were the most necessary people, and how he might
<BR>know what was the most important thing to do.

<P>And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions
differently.

<P>In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time
for every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days,
<BR>months and years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus,
said they, could everything be done at its proper time. Others
<BR>declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the right time
for every action; but that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle
<BR>pastimes, one should always attend to all that was going on, and then
do what was most needful. Others, again, said that however
<BR>attentive the King might be to what was going on, it was impossible
for one man to decide correctly the right time for every action,
<BR>but that he should have a Council of wise men, who would help him to
fix the proper time for everything.

<P>But then again others said there were some things which could not wait
to be laid before a Council, but about which one had at
<BR>once to decide whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide
that one must know beforehand what was going to
<BR>happen. It is only magicians who know that; and, therefore in order
to know the right time for every action, one must consult
<BR>magicians.

<P>Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said,
the people the King most needed were his councillors;
<BR>others, the priests; others, the doctors; while some said the warriors
were the most necessary.

<P>To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation:
some replied that the most important thing in the world was
<BR>science. Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that
it was religious worship.

<P>All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them,
and gave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right
<BR>answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned
for his wisdom.

<P>The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted and he received none
but common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and
<BR>before reaching the hermit's cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving
his bodyguard behind, went on alone.

<P>When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front
of his hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on
<BR>digging. The hermit was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his
spade into the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed
<BR>heavily.

<P>The King went up to him and said: 'I have come to you, wise hermit,
to ask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do
<BR>the right thing at the right time? Who are the people I most need,
and to whom should I, therefore, pay more attention than to the
<BR>rest? And, what affairs are the most important and need my first attention?'

<P>The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat
on his hand and recommenced digging.

<P>'You are tired,' said the King, 'let me take the spade and work awhile
for you.'

<P>'Thanks!' said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat
down on the ground.

<P>When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions.
The hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched
<BR>out his hand for the spade, and said:

<P>'Now rest awhile -- and let me work a bit.'

<P>But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour
passed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the
<BR>trees, and the King at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:

<P>'I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can
give me none, tell me so, and I will return home.'

<P>'Here comes some one running,' said the hermit, 'let us see who it is.'

<P>The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the
wood. The man held his hands pressed against his
<BR>stomach, and blood was flowing from under them. When he reached the
King, he fell fainting on the ground moaning feebly. The
<BR>King and the hermit unfastened the man's clothing. There was a large
wound in his stomach. The King washed it as best he could,
<BR>and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had.
But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again
<BR>and again removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and
rebandaged the wound. When at last the blood ceased
<BR>flowing, the man revived and asked for something to drink. The King
brought fresh water and gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun
<BR>had set, and it had become cool. So the King, with the hermit's help,
carried the wounded man into the hut and laid him on the bed.
<BR>Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes and was quiet; but the King
was so tired with his walk and with the work he had done,
<BR>that he crouched down on the threshold, and also fell asleep -- so
soundly that he slept all through the short summer night. When
<BR>he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where
he was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the
<BR>bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.

<P>'Forgive me!' said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that
the King was awake and was looking at him.

<P>'I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,' said the King.

<P>'You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore
to revenge himself on you, because you executed his
<BR>brother and seized his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the
hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the
<BR>day passed and you did not return. So I came out from my ambush to
find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they
<BR>recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have
bled to death had you not dressed my wound. I wished to
<BR>kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish
it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid my
<BR>sons do the same. Forgive me!'

<P>The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily,
and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only
<BR>forgave him, but said he would send his servants and his own physician
to attend him, and promised to restore his property.

<P>Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch
and looked around for the hermit. Before going away
<BR>he wished once more to beg an answer to the questions he had put. The
hermit was outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the
<BR>beds that had been dug the day before.

<P>The King approached him, and said:

<P>'For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.'

<P>'You have already been answered!' said the hermit still crouching on
his thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before
<BR>him.

<P>'How answered? What do you mean?' asked the King.

<P>'Do you not see,' replied the hermit. 'If you had not pitied my weakness
yesterday, and had not dug these beds for me, but had
<BR>gone your way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have
repented of not having stayed with me. So the most
<BR>important time was when you were digging the beds; and I was the most
important man; and to do me good was your most
<BR>important business. Afterwards, when that man ran to us, the most important
time was when you were attending to him, for if you
<BR>had not bound up his wounds he would have died without having made
peace with you. So he was the most important man, and
<BR>what you did for him was your most important business. Remember then:
there is only one time that is important -- Now! It is the
<BR>most important time because it is the only time when we have any power.
The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for
<BR>no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one else:
and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for
<BR>that purpose alone was man sent into this life!'
