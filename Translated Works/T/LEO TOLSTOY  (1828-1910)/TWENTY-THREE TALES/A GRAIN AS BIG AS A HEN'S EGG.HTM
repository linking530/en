<P>ONE day some children found, in a ravine, a thing shaped like a grain
of corn, with a groove down the middle, but as large as a
<BR>hen's egg. A traveller passing by saw the thing, bought it from the
children for a penny, and taking it to town sold it to the King as
<BR>a curiosity.

<P>The King called together his wise men, and told them to find out what
the thing was. The wise men pondered and pondered and
<BR>could not make head or tail of it, till one day, when the thing was
lying on a window-sill, a hen flew in and pecked at it till she made
<BR>a hole in it, and then every one saw that it was a grain of corn. The
wise men went to the King and said:

<P>'It is a grain of corn.'

<P>At this the King was much surprised; and he ordered the learned men
to find out when and where such corn had grown. The
<BR>learned men pondered again, and searched in their books, but could
find nothing about it. So they returned to the King and said:

<P>'We can give you no answer. There is nothing about it in our books.
You will have to ask the peasants; perhaps some of them may
<BR>have heard from their fathers when and where grain grew to such a size.'

<P>So the King gave orders that some very old peasant should be brought
before him; and his servants found such a man and brought
<BR>him to the King. Old and bent, ashy pale and toothless, he just managed
with the help of two crutches to totter into the King's
<BR>presence.

<P>The King showed him the grain, but the old man could hardly see it;
he took it, however, and felt it with his hands. The King
<BR>questioned him, saying:

<P>'Can you tell us, old man, where such grain as this grew? Have you ever
bought such corn, or sown such in your fields?'

<P>The old man was so deaf that he could hardly hear what the King said,
and only understood with great difficulty.

<P>'No!' he answered at last, 'I never sowed nor reaped any like it in
my fields, nor did I ever buy any such. When we bought corn,
<BR>the grains were always as small as they are now. But you might ask
my father. He may have heard where such grain grew.'

<P>So the King sent for the old man's father, and he was found and brought
before the King. He came walking with one crutch. The
<BR>King showed him the grain, and the old peasant, who was still able
to see, took a good look at it. And the King asked him:

<P>'Can you not tell us, old man, where corn like this used to grow? Have
you ever bought any like it, or sown any in your fields?'

<P>Though the old man was rather hard of hearing, he still heard better
than his son had done.

<P>'No,' he said, 'I never sowed nor reaped any grain like this in my field.
As to buying, I never bought any, for in my time money was
<BR>not yet in use. Every one grew his own corn, and when there was any
need we shared with one another. I do not know where
<BR>corn like this grew. Ours was larger and yielded more flour than present-day
grain, but I never saw any like this. I have, however,
<BR>heard my father say that in his time the grain grew larger and yielded
more flour than ours. You had better ask him.'

<P>So the King sent for this old man's father, and they found him too,
and brought him before the King. He entered walking easily and
<BR>without crutches: his eye was clear, his hearing good, and he spoke
distinctly. The King showed him the grain, and the old
<BR>grandfather looked at it, and turned it about in his hand.

<P>'It is long since I saw such a fine grain,' said he, and he bit a piece
off and tasted it.

<P>'It's the very same kind,' he added.

<P>'Tell me, grandfather,' said the King, 'when and where was such corn
grown? Have you ever bought any like it, or sown any in
<BR>your fields?'

<P>And the old man replied:

<P>'Corn like this used to grow everywhere in my time. I lived on corn
like this in my young days, and fed others on it. It was grain
<BR>like this that we used to sow and reap and thrash.'

<P>And the King asked:

<P>'Tell me, grandfather, did you buy it anywhere, or did you grow it all
yourself?'

<P>The old man smiled.

<P>'In my time,' he answered, 'no one ever thought of such a sin as buying
or selling bread; and we knew nothing of money. Each
<BR>man had corn enough of his own.'

<P>'Then tell me, grandfather,' asked the King, 'where was your field,
where did you grow corn like this?'

<P>And the grandfather answered:

<P>'My field was God's earth. Wherever I ploughed, there was my field.
Land was free. It was a thing no man called his own.
<BR>Labour was the only thing men called their own.'

<P>'Answer me two more questions,' said the King. 'The first is, Why did
the earth bear such grain then and has ceased to do so
<BR>now? And the second is, Why your grandson walks with two crutches,
your son with one, and you yourself with none? Your eyes
<BR>are bright, your teeth sound, and your speech clear and pleasant to
the ear. How have these things come about?'

<P>And the old man answered:

<P>'These things are so, because men have ceased to live by their own labour,
and have taken to depending on the labour of others. In
<BR>the old time, men lived according to God's law. They had what was their
own, and coveted not what others had produced.
