<P><B>(AFTER BERNARDIN DE SENT-PIERRE.)</B>

<P>IN the town of Surat, in India, was a coffee-house where many travellers
and foreigners from all parts of the world met and
<BR>conversed.

<P>One day a learned Persian theologian visited this coffee-house. He was
a man who had spent his life studying the nature of the
<BR>Deity, and reading and writing books upon the subject. He had thought,
read, and written so much about God, that eventually he
<BR>lost his wits became quite confused, and ceased even to believe in
the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing of this, had banished
<BR>him from Persia.

<P>After having argued all his life about the First Cause, this unfortunate
theologian had ended by quite perplexing himself, and instead
<BR>of understanding that he had lost his own reason, he began to think
that there was no higher Reason controlling the universe.

<P>This man had an African slave who followed him everywhere. When the
theologian entered the coffeehouse, the slave remained
<BR>outside, near the door sitting on a stone in the glare of the sun,
and driving away the flies that buzzed around him. The Persian
<BR>having settled down on a divan in the coffee-house, ordered himself
a cup of opium. When he had drunk it and the opium had
<BR>begun to quicken the workings of his brain, he addressed his slave
through the open door:

<P>'Tell me, wretched slave,' said he, 'do you think there is a God, or
not?'

<P>'Of course there is,' said the slave, and immediately drew from under
his girdle a small idol of wood.

<P>'There,' said he, 'that is the God who has guarded me from the day of
my birth. Every one in our country worships the fetish tree,
<BR>from the wood of which this God was made.'

<P>This conversation between the theologian and his slave was listened
to with surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They
<BR>were astonished at the master's question, and yet more so at the slave's
reply.

<P>One of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned
to him and said:

<P>'Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried
under a man's girdle? There is one God -- Brahma, and he is
<BR>greater than the whole world, for he created it. Brahma is the One,
the mighty God, and in His honour are built the temples on the
<BR>Ganges' banks, where his true priests, the Brahmins, worship him. They
know the true God, and none but they. A thousand score
<BR>of years have passed, and yet through revolution after revolution these
priests have held their sway, because Brahma, the one true
<BR>God, has protected them.'

<P>So spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish broker
who was present replied to him, and said:

<P>'No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God protect
the Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the
<BR>Brahmins, but of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but
His chosen people, the Israelites. From the
<BR>commencement of the world, our nation has been beloved of Him, and
ours alone. If we are now scattered over the whole earth it
<BR>is but to try us; for God has promised that He will one day gather
His people together in Jerusalem. Then, with the Temple of
<BR>Jerusalem -- the wonder of the ancient world -- restored to its splendour,
shall Israel be established a ruler over all nations.'

<P>So spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an
Italian missionary who was there interrupted him.

<P>'What you are saying is untrue,' said he to the Jew. 'You attribute
injustice to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay
<BR>rather, even if it be true that of old He favoured the Israelites,
it is now nineteen hundred years since they angered Him, and
<BR>caused Him to destroy their nation and scatter them over the earth,
so that their faith makes no converts and has died out except
<BR>here and there. God shows preference to no nation, but calls all who
wish to be saved to the bosom of the Catholic Church of
<BR>Rome, the one outside whose borders no salvation can be found.'

<P>So spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister who happened to be present,
growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and
<BR>exclaimed:

<P>'How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only
will be saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in
<BR>spirit and in truth, as bidden by the word of Christ.'

<P>Then a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was
sitting in the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air
<BR>of superiority to both the Christians.

<P>'Your belief in your Roman religion is vain,' said he. 'It was superseded
twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of
<BR>Mohammed! You cannot but observe how the true Mohammedan faith continues
to spread both in Europe and Asia, and even in
<BR>the enlightened country of China. You say yourselves that God has rejected
the Jews; and, as a proof, you quote the fact that the
<BR>Jews are humiliated and their faith does not spread. Confess then the
truth of Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant and spreads
<BR>far and wide. None will be saved but the followers of Mohammed, God's
latest prophet; and of them, only the followers of Omar,
<BR>and not of Ali, for the latter are false to the faith.'

<P>To this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished to
reply; but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all
<BR>the strangers of different faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian
Christians, Llamas from Thibet, Ismailians and
<BR>Fire-worshippers. They all argued about the nature of God, and how
He should be worshipped. Each of them asserted that in his
<BR>country alone was the true God known and rightly worshipped.

<P>Every one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of Confucius,
who sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not
<BR>joining in the dispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to
what the others said, but did not speak himself.

<P>The Turk noticed him sitting there, and appealed to him, saying:

<P>'You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman. You hold your peace,
but if you spoke I know you would uphold my opinion.
<BR>Traders from your country, who come to me for assistance, tell me that
though many religions have been introduced into China,
<BR>you Chinese consider Mohammedanism the best of all, and adopt it willingly.
Confirm, then, my words, and tell us your opinion of
<BR>the true God and of His prophet.'

<P>'Yes, yes,' said the rest, turning to the Chinaman, 'let us hear what
you think on the subject.'

<P>The Chinaman, the student of Confucius, closed his eyes, and thought
a while. Then he opened them again, and drawing his hands
<BR>out of the wide sleeves of his garment, and folding them on his breast,
he spoke as follows, in a calm and quiet voice.

<P>Sirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that prevents men agreeing
with one another on matters of faith. If you care to listen to
<BR>me, I will tell you a story which will explain this by an example.

<P>I came here from China on an English steamer which had been round the
world. We stopped for fresh water, and landed on the
<BR>east coast of the island of Sumatra. It was mid-day, and some of us,
having landed, sat in the shade of some coconut palms by the
<BR>seashore, not far from a native village. We were a party of men of
different nationalities.

<P>As we sat there, a blind man approached us. We learnt afterwards that
he had gone blind from gazing too long and too persistently
<BR>at the sun, trying to find out what it is, in order to seize its light.

<P>He strove a long time to accomplish this, constantly looking at the
sun; but the only result was that his eyes were injured by its
<BR>brightness, and he became blind.

<P>Then he said to himself:

<P>'The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it were a liquid it would
be possible to pour it from one vessel into another, and it would be
<BR>moved, like water, by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were
fire, water would extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is seen
<BR>by the eye, nor is it matter, for it cannot be moved. Therefore, as
the light of the sun is neither liquid, nor fire, nor spirit, nor matter,
<BR>it is -- nothing!'

<P>So he argued, and, as a result of always looking at the sun and always
thinking about it, he lost both his sight and his reason. And
<BR>when he went quite blind, he became fully convinced that the sun did
not exist.

<P>With this blind man came a slave, who after placing his master in the
shade of a coconut tree, picked up a coconut from the
<BR>ground, and began making it into a night-light. He twisted a wick from
the fibre of the coconut: squeezed oil from the nut into the
<BR>shell, and soaked the wick in it.

<P>As the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed and said to him:

<P>'Well, slave, was I not right when I told you there is no sun? Do you
not see how dark it is? Yet people say there is a sun. . . . But
<BR>if so, what is it?'

<P>'I do not know what the sun is,' said the slave 'That is no business
of mine. But I know what light is. Here, I have made a
<BR>night-light, by the help of which I can serve you and find anything
I want in the hut.'

<P>And the slave picked up the coconut shell, saying:

<P>'This is my sun.'

<P>A lame man with crutches, who was sitting near by heard these words,
and laughed:

<P>'You have evidently been blind all your life,' said he to the blind
man, 'not to know what the sun is, I will tell you what it is. The sun
<BR>is a ball of fire, which rises every morning out of the sea and goes
down again among the mountains of our island each evening.
<BR>We have all seen this, and if you had had your eyesight you too would
have seen it.'

<P>A fisherman, who had been listening to the conversation, said:

<P>'It is plain enough that you have never been beyond your own island.
If you were not lame, and if you had been out as I have in a
<BR>fishing-boat, you would know that the sun does not set among the mountains
of our island, but as it rises from the ocean every
<BR>morning so it sets again in the sea every night. What I am telling
you is true, for I see it every day with my own eyes.'

<P>Then an Indian who was of our party, interrupted him by saying:

<P>'I am astonished that a reasonable man should talk such nonsense. How
can a ball of fire possibly descend into the water and not
<BR>be extinguished? The sun is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity
named Deva who rides for ever in a chariot round the golden
<BR>mountain, Meru. Sometimes the evil serpents Ragu and Ketu attack Deva
and swallow him: and then the earth is dark. But our
<BR>priests pray that the Deity may be released, and then he is set free.
Only such ignorant men as you, who have never been beyond
<BR>their own island, can imagine that the sun shines for their country
alone.'

<P>Then the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was present, spoke in his
turn.

<P>'No,' said he, 'you also are wrong. The sun is not a Deity, and does
not move only round India and its golden mountain. I have
<BR>sailed much on the Black Sea, and along the coasts of Arabia, and have
been to Madagascar and to the Philippines. The sun lights
<BR>the whole earth, and not India alone. It does not circle round one
mountain, but rises far in the east, beyond the Isles of Japan, and
<BR>sets far, far away in the west, beyond the islands of England. That
is why the Japanese call their country "Nippon," that is "the
<BR>birth of the sun." I know this well, for I have myself seen much, and
heard more from my grandfather, who sailed to the very ends
<BR>of the sea.'

<P>He would have gone on, but an English sailor from our ship interrupted
him.

<P>'There is no country,' he said, 'where people know so much about the
sun's movements as in England. The sun, as every one in
<BR>England knows, rises nowhere and sets nowhere. It is always moving
round the earth. We can be sure of this for we have just
<BR>been round the world ourselves, and nowhere knocked up against the
sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed itself in the
<BR>morning and hid itself at night, just as it does here.'

<P>And the Englishman took a stick and, drawing circles on the sand, tried
to explain how the sun moves in the heavens and goes
<BR>round the world. But he was unable to explain it clearly, and pointing
to the ship's pilot said:

<P>'This man knows more about it than I do. He can explain it properly.'

<P>The pilot, who was an intelligent man, had listened in silence to the
talk till he was asked to speak. Now every one turned to him,
<BR>and he said:

<P>'You are all misleading one another, and are yourselves deceived. The
sun does not go round the earth, but the earth goes round
<BR>the sun, revolving as it goes and turning towards the sun in the course
of each twenty-four hours, not only Japan, and the
<BR>Philippines and Sumatra where we now are, but Africa, and Europe and
America, and many lands besides. The sun does not shine
<BR>for some one mountain, or for some one island, or for some one sea,
nor even for one earth alone, but for other planets as well as
<BR>our earth. If you would only look up at the heavens, instead of at
the ground beneath your own feet, you might all understand this,
<BR>and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines for you, or for
your country alone.'

<P>Thus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged much about the world, and
had gazed much upon the heavens above.

<P>'So on matters of faith,' continued the Chinaman the student of Confucius,
'it is pride that causes error and discord among men. As
<BR>with the sun, so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God
of his own, or at least a special God for his native land.
<BR>Each nation wishes to confine in its own temples Him, whom the world
cannot contain.

<P>'Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite
all men in one faith and one religion?

<P>'All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God's
own world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its
<BR>lamps, its pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the
law, its offerings, its altars and its priests. But in what temple is
<BR>there such a font as the ocean; such a vault as that of the heavens;
such lamps as the sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be
<BR>compared with living, loving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there
any records of God's goodness so easy to understand as the
<BR>blessings which God has strewn abroad for man's happiness? Where is
there any book of the law so clear to each man as that
<BR>written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the self-denials which
loving men and women make for one another? And what altar
<BR>can be compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself
accepts the sacrifice?

<P>'The higher a man's conception of God, the better will he know Him.
And the better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to
<BR>Him, imitating His goodness, His mercy, and His love of man.

<P>'Therefore, let him who sees the sun's whole light filling the world,
refrain from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in
<BR>his own idol sees one ray of that same light. Let him not despise even
the unbeliever who is blind and cannot see the sun at all.'

<P>So spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were present
in the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more
<BR>as to whose faith was the best.
