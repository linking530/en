<P><B>A LEGEND.</B>

<P>THIS is a legend current among the South American Indians.

<P>God, say they, at first made men so that they had no need to work: they
needed neither houses, nor clothes, nor food, and they all
<BR>lived till they were a hundred, and did not know what illness was.

<P>When, after some time, God looked to see how people were living, he
saw that instead of being happy in their life, they had
<BR>quarrelled with one another, and, each caring for himself, had brought
matters to such a pass that far from enjoying life, they
<BR>cursed it.

<P>Then God said to himself: 'This comes of their living separately, each
for himself.' And to change this state of things, God so
<BR>arranged matters that it became impossible for people to live without
working. To avoid suffering from cold and hunger, they were
<BR>now obliged to build dwellings, and to dig the ground, and to grow
and gather fruits and grain.

<P>'Work will bring them together,' thought God.

<P>'They cannot make their tools, prepare and transport their timber, build
their houses, sow and gather their harvests, spin and
<BR>weave, and make their clothes, each one alone by himself.'

<P>'It will make them understand that the more heartily they work together,
the more they will have and the better they will live; and
<BR>this will unite them.'

<P>Time passed on, and again God came to see how men were living, and whether
they were now happy.

<P>But he found them living worse than before. They worked together (that
they could not help doing), but not all together, being
<BR>broken up into little groups. And each group tried to snatch work from
other groups, and they hindered one another, wasting time
<BR>and strength in their struggles, so that things went ill with them
all.

<P>Having seen that this, too, was not well, God decided so as to arrange
things that man should not know the time of his death, but
<BR>might die at any moment; and he announced this to them.

<P>'Knowing that each of them may die at any moment,' thought God, 'they
will not, by grasping at gains that may last so short a time,
<BR>spoil the hours of life allotted to them.'

<P>But it turned out otherwise. When God returned to see how people were
living, he saw that their life was as bad as ever.

<P>Those who were strongest, availing themselves of the fact that men might
die at any time, subdued those who were weaker, killing
<BR>some and threatening others with death. And it came about that the
strongest and their descendants did no work, and suffered
<BR>from the weariness of idleness, while those who were weaker had to
work beyond their strength, and suffered from lack of rest.
<BR>Each set of men feared and hated the other. And the life of man became
yet more unhappy.

<P>Having seen all this, God, to mend matters, decided to make use of one
last means; he sent all kinds of sickness among men. God
<BR>thought that when all men were exposed to sickness they would understand
that those who are well should have pity on those who
<BR>are sick, and should help them, that when they themselves fall ill
those who are well might in turn help them.

<P>And again God went away, but when He came back to see how men lived
now that they were subject to sicknesses, he saw that
<BR>their life was worse even than before. The very sickness that in God's
purpose should have united men, had divided them more
<BR>than ever. Those men who were strong enough to make others work, forced
them also to wait on them in times of sickness; but
<BR>they did not, in their turn, look after others who were ill. And those
who were forced to work for others and to look after them
<BR>when sick, were so worn with work that they had no time to look after
their own sick, but left them without attendance. That the
<BR>sight of sick folk might not disturb the pleasures of the wealthy,
houses were arranged in which these poor people suffered and
<BR>died, far from those whose sympathy might have cheered them, and in
the arms of hired people who nursed them without
<BR>compassion, or even with disgust. Moreover, people considered many
of the illnesses infectious, and, fearing to catch them, not
<BR>only avoided the sick, but even separated themselves from those who
attended the sick.

<P>Then God said to Himself: 'If even this means will not bring men to
understand wherein their happiness lies, let them be taught by
<BR>suffering.' And God left men to themselves.

<P>And, left to themselves, men lived long before they understood that
they all ought to, and might be, happy. Only in the very latest
<BR>times have a few of them begun to understand that work ought not to
be a bugbear to some and like galley-slavery for others, but
<BR>should be a common and happy occupation, uniting all men. They have
begun to understand that with death constantly threatening
<BR>each of us, the only reasonable business of every man is to spend the
years, months, hours, and minutes, allotted him -- in unity and
<BR>love. They have begun to understand that sickness, far from dividing
men, should, on the contrary, give opportunity for loving union
<BR>with one another.
