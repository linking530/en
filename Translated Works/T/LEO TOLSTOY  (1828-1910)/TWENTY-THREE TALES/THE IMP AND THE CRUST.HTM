<P>A POOR peasant set out early one morning to plough, taking with him
for his breakfast a crust of bread. He got his plough ready,
<BR>wrapped the bread in his coat, put it under a bush, and set to work.
After a while when his horse was tired and he was hungry, the
<BR>peasant fixed the plough, let the horse loose to graze and went to
get his coat and his breakfast

<P>He lifted the coat, but the bread was gone! He looked and looked, turned
the coat over, shook it out -- but the bread was gone.
<BR>The peasant could not make this out at all.

<P>'That's strange,' thought he; 'I saw no one, but all the same some one
has been here and has taken the bread!'

<P>It was an imp who had stolen the bread while the peasant was ploughing,
and at that moment he was sitting behind the bush,
<BR>waiting to hear the peasant swear and call on the Devil.

<P>The peasant was sorry to lose his breakfast, but 'It can't be helped,'
said he. 'After all, I shan't die of hunger! No doubt whoever
<BR>took the bread needed it. May it do him good!'

<P>And he went to the well, had a drink of water, and rested a bit. Then
he caught his horse, harnessed it, and began ploughing again.

<P>The imp was crestfallen at not having made the peasant sin, and he went
to report what had happened to the Devil, his master.

<P>He came to the Devil and told how he had taken the peasant's bread,
and how the peasant instead of cursing had said, 'May it do
<BR>him good!'

<P>The Devil was angry, and replied: 'If the man got the better of you,
it was your own fault -- you don't understand your business! If
<BR>the peasants, and their wives after them, take to that sort of thing,
it will be all up with us. The matter can't be left like that! Go
<BR>back at once,' said he, 'and put things right. If in three years you
don't get the better of that peasant, I'll have you ducked in holy
<BR>water!'

<P>The imp was frightened. He scampered back to earth, thinking how he
could redeem his fault. He thought and thought, and at last
<BR>hit upon a good plan.

<P>He turned himself into a labouring man, and went and took service with
the poor peasant. The first year he advised the peasant to
<BR>sow corn in a marshy place. The peasant took his advice, and sowed
in the marsh. The year turned out a very dry one, and the
<BR>crops of the other peasants were all scorched by the sun, but the poor
peasant's corn grew thick and tall and full-eared. Not only
<BR>had he grain enough to last him for the whole year, but he had much
left over besides.

<P>The next year the imp advised the peasant to sow on the hill; and it
turned out a wet summer. Other people's corn was beaten
<BR>down and rotted and the ears did not fill; but the peasant's crop,
up on the hill, was a fine one. He had more grain left over than
<BR>before, so that he did not know what to do with it all.

<P>Then the imp showed the peasant how he could mash the grain and distil
spirit from it; and the peasant made strong drink, and
<BR>began to drink it himself and to give it to his friends.

<P>So the imp went to the Devil, his master, and boasted that he had made
up for his failure. The Devil said that he would come and
<BR>see for himself how the case stood.

<P>He came to the peasant's house, and saw that the peasant had invited
his well-to-do neighbours and was treating them to drink.
<BR>His wife was offering the drink to the guests, and as she handed it
round she tumbled against the table and spilt a glassful.

<P>The peasant was angry, and scolded his wife: 'What do you mean, you
slut? Do you think it's ditchwater, you cripple, that you
<BR>must go pouring good stuff like that over the floor?'

<P>The imp nudged the Devil, his master, with his elbow: 'See,' said he,
'that's the man who did not grudge his last crust!'

<P>The peasant, still railing at his wife, began to carry the drink round
himself. Just then a poor peasant returning from work came in
<BR>uninvited. He greeted the company, sat down, and saw that they were
drinking. Tired with his day's work he felt that he too would
<BR>like a drop. He sat and sat, and his mouth kept watering, but the host
instead of offering him any only muttered: 'I can't find drink
<BR>for every one who comes along.'

<P>This pleased the Devil; but the imp chuckled and said, 'Wait a bit,
there's more to come yet!'

<P>The rich peasants drank, and their host drank too. And they began to
make false, oily speeches to one another.

<P>The Devil listened and listened, and praised the imp.

<P>'If,' said he, 'the drink makes them so foxy that they begin to cheat
each other, they will soon all be in our hands.'

<P>'Wait for what's coming,' said the imp. 'Let them have another glass
all round. Now they are like foxes, wagging their tails and
<BR>trying to get round one another; but presently you will see them like
savage wolves.'

<P>The peasants had another glass each, and their talk became wilder and
rougher. Instead of oily speeches they began to abuse and
<BR>snarl at one another. Soon they took to fighting, and punched one another's
noses. And the host joined in the fight, and he too got
<BR>well beaten.

<P>The Devil looked on and was much pleased at all this. 'This is first-rate!'
said he.

<P>But the imp replied: 'Wait a bit -- the best is yet to come. Wait till
they have had a third glass. Now they are raging like wolves, but
<BR>let them have one more glass, and they will be like swine.'

<P>The peasants had their third glass, and became quite like brutes. They
muttered and shouted, not knowing why, and not listening to
<BR>one another.

<P>Then the party began to break up. Some went alone, some in twos, and
some in threes, all staggering down the street. The host
<BR>went out to speed his guests, but he fell on his nose into a puddle,
smeared himself from top to toe, and lay there grunting like a
<BR>hog.

<P>This pleased the Devil still more.

<P>'Well,' said he, 'you have hit on a first-rate drink, and have quite
made up for your blunder about the bread. But now tell me how
<BR>this drink is made. You must first have put in fox's blood: that was
what made the peasants sly as foxes. Then, I suppose, you
<BR>added wolf's blood: that is what made them fierce like wolves. And
you must have finished off with swine's blood, to make them
<BR>behave like swine.'

<P>'No,' said the imp, 'that was not the way I did it. All I did was to
see that the peasant had more corn than he needed. The blood of
<BR>the beasts is always in man; but as long as he has only enough corn
for his needs, it is kept in bounds. While that was the case, the
<BR>peasant did not grudge his last crust. But when he had corn left over,
he looked for ways of getting pleasure out of it. And I
<BR>showed him a pleasure -- drinking! And when he began to turn God's
good gifts into spirits for his own pleasure -- the fox's, wolf's
<BR>and swine's blood in him all came out. If only he goes on drinking,
he will always be a beast!'

<P>The Devil praised the imp, forgave him for his former blunder, and advanced
him to a post of high honour.
