<P>AN OLD LEGEND CURRENT IN THE VOLGA DISTRICT

<P>'And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they
think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not
<BR>therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have
need of, before ye ask Him.' -- Matt. vi. 7, 8.

<P>A BISHOP was sailing from Archangel to the Solov&eacute;tsk Monastery;
and on the same vessel were a number of pilgrims on their
<BR>way to visit the shrines at that place. The voyage was a smooth one.
The wind favourable, and the weather fair. The pilgrims lay
<BR>on deck, eating, or sat in groups talking to one another. The Bishop,
too, came on deck, and as he was pacing up and down, he
<BR>noticed a group of men standing near the prow and listening to a fisherman
who was pointing to the sea and telling them
<BR>something. The Bishop stopped, and looked in the direction in which
the man was pointing. He could see nothing however, but the
<BR>sea glistening in the sunshine. He drew nearer to listen, but when
the man saw him, he took off his cap and was silent. The rest of
<BR>the people also took off their caps, and bowed.

<P>'Do not let me disturb you, friends,' said the Bishop. 'I came to hear
what this good man was saying.'

<P>'The fisherman was telling us about the hermits,' replied one, a tradesman,
rather bolder than the rest.

<P>'What hermits?' asked the Bishop, going to the side of the vessel and
seating himself on a box. 'Tell me about them. I should like to
<BR>hear. What were you pointing at?'

<P>'Why, that little island you can just see over there,' answered the
man, pointing to a spot ahead and a little to the right. 'That is the
<BR>island where the hermits live for the salvation of their souls.'

<P>'Where is the island?' asked the Bishop. 'I see nothing.'

<P>'There, in the distance, if you will please look along my hand. Do you
see that little cloud? Below it and a bit to the left, there is just
<BR>a faint streak. That is the island.'

<P>The Bishop looked carefully, but his unaccustomed eyes could make out
nothing but the water shimmering in the sun.

<P>'I cannot see it,' he said. 'But who are the hermits that live there?'

<P>'They are holy men,' answered the fisherman. 'I had long heard tell
of them, but never chanced to see them myself till the year
<BR>before last.'

<P>And the fisherman related how once, when he was out fishing, he had
been stranded at night upon that island, not knowing where
<BR>he was. In the morning, as he wandered about the island, he came across
an earth hut, and met an old man standing near it.
<BR>Presently two others came out, and after having fed him, and dried
his things, they helped him mend his boat.

<P>'And what are they like?' asked the Bishop.

<P>'One is a small man and his back is bent. He wears a priest's cassock
and is very old; he must be more than a hundred, I should
<BR>say. He is so old that the white of his beard is taking a greenish
tinge, but he is always smiling, and his face is as bright as an
<BR>angel's from heaven. The second is taller, but he also is very old.
He wears tattered, peasant coat. His beard is broad, and of a
<BR>yellowish grey colour. He is a strong man. Before I had time to help
him, he turned my boat over as if it were only a pail. He too,
<BR>is kindly and cheerful. The third is tall, and has a beard as white
as snow and reaching to his knees. He is stern, with over-hanging
<BR>eyebrows; and he wears nothing but a mat tied round his waist.'

<P>'And did they speak to you?' asked the Bishop.

<P>'For the most part they did everything in silence and spoke but little
even to one another. One of them would just give a glance, and
<BR>the others would understand him. I asked the tallest whether they had
lived there long. He frowned, and muttered something as if
<BR>he were angry; but the oldest one took his hand and smiled, and then
the tall one was quiet. The oldest one only said: "Have mercy
<BR>upon us," and smiled.'

<P>While the fisherman was talking, the ship had drawn nearer to the island.

<P>'There, now you can see it plainly, if your Grace will please to look,'
said the tradesman, pointing with his hand.

<P>The Bishop looked, and now he really saw a dark streak -- which was
the island. Having looked at it a while, he left the prow of
<BR>the vessel, and going to the stern, asked the helmsman:

<P>'What island is that?'

<P>'That one,' replied the man, 'has no name. There are many such in this
sea.'

<P>'Is it true that there are hermits who live there for the salvation
of their souls?'

<P>'So it is said, your Grace, but I don't know if it's true. Fishermen
say they have seen them; but of course they may only be spinning
<BR>yarns.'

<P>'I should like to land on the island and see these men,' said the Bishop.
'How could I manage it?'

<P>'The ship cannot get close to the island,' replied the helmsman, 'but
you might be rowed there in a boat. You had better speak to
<BR>the captain.'

<P>The captain was sent for and came.

<P>'I should like to see these hermits,' said the Bishop. 'Could I not
be rowed ashore?'

<P>The captain tried to dissuade him.

<P>'Of course it could be done,' said he, 'but we should lose much time.
And if I might venture to say so to your Grace, the old men
<BR>are not worth your pains. I have heard say that they are foolish old
fellows, who understand nothing, and never speak a word, any
<BR>more than the fish in the sea.'

<P>'I wish to see them,' said the Bishop, 'and I will pay you for your
trouble and loss of time. Please let me have a boat.'

<P>There was no help for it; so the order was given. The sailors trimmed
the sails, the steersman put up the helm, and the ship's
<BR>course was set for the island. A chair was placed at the prow for the
Bishop, and he sat there, looking ahead. The passengers all
<BR>collected at the prow, and gazed at the island. Those who had the sharpest
eyes could presently make out the rocks on it, and then
<BR>a mud hut was seen. At last one man saw the hermits themselves. The
captain brought a telescope and, after looking through it,
<BR>handed it to the Bishop.

<P>'It's right enough. There are three men standing on the shore. There,
a little to the right of that big rock.'

<P>The Bishop took the telescope, got it into position, and he saw the
three men: a tall one, a shorter one, and one very small and bent,
<BR>standing on the shore and holding each other by the hand.

<P>The captain turned to the Bishop.

<P>'The vessel can get no nearer in than this, your Grace. If you wish
to go ashore, we must ask you to go in the boat, while we
<BR>anchor here.'

<P>The cable was quickly let out, the anchor cast, and the sails furled.
There was a jerk, and the vessel shook. Then a boat having
<BR>been lowered, the oarsmen jumped in, and the Bishop descended the ladder
and took his seat. The men pulled at their oars, and the
<BR>boat moved rapidly towards the island. When they came within a stone's
throw they saw three old men: a tall one with only a mat
<BR>tied round his waist: a shorter one in a tattered peasant coat, and
a very old one bent with age and wearing an old cassock -- all
<BR>three standing hand in hand.

<P>The oarsmen pulled in to the shore, and held on with the boathook while
the Bishop got out.

<P>The old men bowed to him, and he gave them his benediction, at which
they bowed still lower. Then the Bishop began to speak to
<BR>them.

<P>'I have heard,' he said, 'that you, godly men, live here saving your
own souls, and praying to our Lord Christ for your fellow men. I,
<BR>an unworthy servant of Christ, am called, by God's mercy, to keep and
teach His flock. I wished to see you, servants of God, and
<BR>to do what I can to teach you, also.'

<P>The old men looked at each other smiling, but remained silent.

<P>'Tell me,' said the Bishop, 'what you are doing to save your souls,
and how you serve God on this island.'

<P>The second hermit sighed, and looked at the oldest, the very ancient
one. The latter smiled, and said:

<P>'We do not know how to serve God. We only serve and support ourselves,
servant of God.'

<P>'But how do you pray to God?' asked the Bishop.

<P>'We pray in this way,' replied the hermit. 'Three are ye, three are
we, have mercy upon us.'

<P>And when the old man said this, all three raised their eyes to heaven,
and repeated:

<P>'Three are ye, three are we, have mercy upon us!'

<P>The Bishop smiled.

<P>'You have evidently heard something about the Holy Trinity,' said he.
'But you do not pray aright. You have won my affection,
<BR>godly men. I see you wish to please the Lord, but you do not know how
to serve Him. That is not the way to pray; but listen to me,
<BR>and I will teach you. I will teach you, not a way of my own, but the
way in which God in the Holy Scriptures has commanded all
<BR>men to pray to Him.'

<P>And the Bishop began explaining to the hermits how God had revealed
Himself to men; telling them of God the Father, and God
<BR>the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.

<P>'God the Son came down on earth,' said he, 'to save men, and this is
how He taught us all to pray. Listen and repeat after me:
<BR>"Our Father."'

<P>And the first old man repeated after him, 'Our Father,' and the second
said, 'Our Father,' and the third said, 'Our Father.'

<P>'Which art in heaven,' continued the Bishop.

<P>The first hermit repeated, 'Which art in heaven,' but the second blundered
over the words, and the tall hermit could not say them
<BR>properly. His hair had grown over his mouth so that he could not speak
plainly. The very old hermit, having no teeth, also mumbled
<BR>indistinctly.

<P>The Bishop repeated the words again, and the old men repeated them after
him. The Bishop sat down on a stone, and the old men
<BR>stood before him, watching his mouth, and repeating the words as he
uttered them. And all day long the Bishop laboured, saying a
<BR>word twenty, thirty, a hundred times over, and the old men repeated
it after him. They blundered, and he corrected them, and
<BR>made them begin again.

<P>The Bishop did not leave off till he had taught them the whole of the
Lord's prayer so that they could not only repeat it after him,
<BR>but could say it by themselves. The middle one was the first to know
it, and to repeat the whole of it alone. The Bishop made him
<BR>say it again and again, and at last the others could say it too.

<P>It was getting dark, and the moon was appearing over the water, before
the Bishop rose to return to the vessel. When he took
<BR>leave of the old men, they all bowed down to the ground before him.
He raised them, and kissed each of them, telling them to pray
<BR>as he had taught them. Then he got into the boat and returned to the
ship.

<P>And as he sat in the boat and was rowed to the ship he could hear the
three voices of the hermits loudly repeating the Lord's
<BR>prayer. As the boat drew near the vessel their voices could no longer
be heard, but they could still be seen in the moonlight,
<BR>standing as he had left them on the shore, the shortest in the middle,
the tallest on the right, the middle one on the left. As soon as
<BR>the Bishop had reached the vessel and got on board, the anchor was
weighed and the sails unfurled. The wind filled them, and the
<BR>ship sailed away, and the Bishop took a seat in the stern and watched
the island they had left. For a time he could still see the
<BR>hermits, but presently they disappeared from sight, though the island
was still visible. At last it too vanished, and only the sea was
<BR>to be seen, rippling in the moonlight.

<P>The pilgrims lay down to sleep, and all was quiet on deck. The Bishop
did not wish to sleep, but sat alone at the stern, gazing at the
<BR>sea where the island was no longer visible, and thinking of the good
old men. He thought how pleased they had been to learn the
<BR>Lord's prayer; and he thanked God for having sent him to teach and
help such godly men.

<P>So the Bishop sat, thinking, and gazing at the sea where the island
had disappeared. And the moonlight flickered before his eyes,
<BR>sparkling, now here, now there, upon the waves. Suddenly he saw something
white and shining, on the bright path which the moon
<BR>cast across the sea. Was it a seagull, or the little gleaming sail
of some small boat? The Bishop fixed his eyes on it, wondering.

<P>'It must be a boat sailing after us,' thought he 'but it is overtaking
us very rapidly. It was far, far away a minute ago, but now it is
<BR>much nearer. It cannot be a boat, for I can see no sail; but whatever
it may be, it is following us, and catching us up.'

<P>And he could not make out what it was. Not a boat, nor a bird, nor a
fish! It was too large for a man, and besides a man could not
<BR>be out there in the midst of the sea. The Bishop rose, and said to
the helmsman:

<P>'Look there, what is that, my friend? What is it?' the Bishop repeated,
though he could now see plainly what it was -- the three
<BR>hermits running upon the water, all gleaming white, their grey beards
shining, and approaching the ship as quickly as though it were
<BR>not morning.

<P>The steersman looked and let go the helm in terror.

<P>'Oh Lord! The hermits are running after us on the water as though it
were dry land!'

<P>The passengers hearing him, jumped up, and crowded to the stern. They
saw the hermits coming along hand in hand, and the two
<BR>outer ones beckoning the ship to stop. All three were gliding along
upon the water without moving their feet. Before the ship could
<BR>be stopped, the hermits had reached it, and raising their heads, all
three as with one voice, began to say:

<P>'We have forgotten your teaching, servant of God. As long as we kept
repeating it we remembered, but when we stopped saying it
<BR>for a time, a word dropped out, and now it has all gone to pieces.
We can remember nothing of it. Teach us again.'

<P>The Bishop crossed himself, and leaning over the ship's side, said:

<P>'Your own prayer will reach the Lord, men of God. It is not for me to
teach you. Pray for us sinners.

<P>And the Bishop bowed low before the old men; and they turned and went
back across the sea. And a light shone until daybreak on
<BR>the spot where they were lost to sight.
