<P>IN a certain town there lived a cobbler, Martin Avd&eacute;iteh by name.
He had a tiny room in a basement, the one window of which
<BR>looked out on to the street. Through it one could only see the feet
of those who passed by, but Martin recognized the people by
<BR>their boots. He had lived long in the place and had many acquaintances.
There was hardly a pair of boots in the neighbourhood
<BR>that had not been once or twice through his hands, so he often saw
his own handiwork through the window. Some he had re-soled,
<BR>some patched, some stitched up, and to some he had even put fresh uppers.
He had plenty to do, for he worked well, used good
<BR>material, did not charge too much, and could be relied on. If he could
do a job by the day required, he undertook it; if not, he told
<BR>the truth and gave no false promises; so he was well known and never
short of work.

<P>Martin had always been a good man; but in his old age he began to think
more about his soul and to draw nearer to God. While he
<BR>still worked for a master, before he set up on his own account, his
wife had died, leaving him with a three-year old son. None of
<BR>his elder children had lived, they had all died in infancy. At first
Martin thought of sending his little son to his sister's in the country,
<BR>but then he felt sorry to part with the boy, thinking: 'It would be
hard for my little Kapit&oacute;n to have to grow up in a strange family;
I
<BR>will keep him with me.'

<P>Martin left his master and went into lodgings with his little son. But
he had no luck with his children. No sooner had the boy
<BR>reached an age when he could help his father and be a support as well
as a joy to him, than he fell ill and, after being laid up for a
<BR>week with a burning fever, died. Martin buried his son, and gave way
to despair so great and overwhelming that he murmured
<BR>against God. In his sorrow he prayed again and again that he too might
die, reproaching God for having taken the son he loved, his
<BR>only son while he, old as he was, remained alive. After that Martin
left off going to church.

<P>One day an old man from Martin's native village who had been a pilgrim
for the last eight years, called in on his way from Tr&oacute;itsa
<BR>Monastery. Martin opened his heart to him, and told him of his sorrow.

<P>'I no longer even wish to live, holy man,' he said. 'All I ask of God
is that I soon may die. I am now quite without hope in the
<BR>world.'

<P>The old man replied: 'You have no right to say such things, Martin.
We cannot judge God's ways. Not our reasoning, but God's
<BR>will, decides. If God willed that your son should die and you should
live, it must be best so. As to your despair -- that comes
<BR>because you wish to live for your own happiness.'

<P>'What else should one live for?' asked Martin.

<P>'For God, Martin,' said the old man. 'He gives you life, and you must
live for Him. When you have learnt to live for Him, you will
<BR>grieve no more, and all will seem easy to you.'

<P>Martin was silent awhile, and then asked: 'But how is one to live for
God?'

<P>The old man answered: 'How one may live for God has been shown us by
Christ. Can you read? Then buy the Gospels, and read
<BR>them: there you will see how God would have you live. You have it all
there.'

<P>These words sank deep into Martin's heart, and that same day he went
and bought himself a Testament in large print, and began
<BR>to read.

<P>At first he meant only to read on holidays, but having once begun he
found it made his heart so light that he read every day.
<BR>Sometimes he was so absorbed in his reading that the oil in his lamp
burnt out before he could tear himself away from the book.
<BR>He continued to read every night, and the more he read the more clearly
he understood what God required of him, and how he
<BR>might live for God. And his heart grew lighter and lighter. Before,
when he went to bed he used to lie with a heavy heart, moaning
<BR>as he thought of his little Kapit&oacute;n; but now he only repeated
again and again: 'Glory to Thee, glory to Thee, O Lord! Thy will be
<BR>done!'

<P>From that time Martin's whole life changed. Formerly, on holidays he
used to go and have tea at the public house, and did not even
<BR>refuse a glass or two of v&oacute;dka. Sometimes, after having had
a drop with a friend, he left the public house not drunk, but rather
<BR>merry, and would say foolish things: shout at a man, or abuse him.
Now, all that sort of thing passed away from him. His life
<BR>became peaceful and joyful. He sat down to his work in the morning,
and when he had finished his day's work he took the lamp
<BR>down from the wall, stood it on the table, fetched his book from the
shelf, opened it, and sat down to read. The more he read the
<BR>better he understood, and the clearer and happier he felt in his mind.

<P>It happened once that Martin sat up late, absorbed in his book. He was
reading Luke's Gospel; and in the sixth chapter he came
<BR>upon the verses:

<P>'To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and
from him that taketh away thy cloke withhold not thy coat
<BR>also. Give to every man that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away
thy goods ask them not again. And as ye would that men
<BR>should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.'

<P>He also read the verses where our Lord says:

<P>'And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
<BR>them, I will shew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built
an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock:
<BR>and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,
and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. But
<BR>he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation
built an house upon the earth, against which the stream did
<BR>beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house
was great.'

<P>When Martin read these words his soul was glad within him. He took off
his spectacles and laid them on the book, and leaning his
<BR>elbows on the table pondered over what he had read. He tried his own
life by the standard of those words, asking himself:

<P>'Is my house built on the rock, or on sand? If it stands on the rock,
it is well. It seems easy enough while one sits here alone, and
<BR>one thinks one has done all that God commands; but as soon as I cease
to be on my guard, I sin again. Still I will persevere. It
<BR>brings such joy. Help me, O Lord!'

<P>He thought all this, and was about to go to bed, but was loth to leave
his book. So he went on reading the seventh chapter -- about
<BR>the centurion, the widow's son, and the answer to John's disciples
-- and he came to the part where a rich Pharisee invited the
<BR>Lord to his house; and he read how the woman who was a sinner, anointed
his feet and washed them with her tears, and how he
<BR>justified her. Coming to the forty-fourth verse, he read:

<P>'And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?
I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my
<BR>feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with
her hair. Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since the time I
<BR>came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst
not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.'

<P>He read these verses and thought: 'He gave no water for his feet, gave
no kiss, his head with oil he did not anoint. . . .' And Martin
<BR>took off his spectacles once more, laid them on his book, and pondered.

<P>'He must have been like me, that Pharisee. He too thought only of himself
-- how to get a cup of tea, how to keep warm and
<BR>comfortable; never a thought of his guest. He took care of himself,
but for his guest he cared nothing at all. Yet who was the
<BR>guest? The Lord himself! If he came to me, should I behave like that?'

<P>Then Martin laid his head upon both his arms and, before he was aware
of it, he fell asleep.

<P>'Martin!' he suddenly heard a voice, as if some one had breathed the
word above his ear.

<P>He started from his sleep. 'Who's there?' he asked.

<P>He turned round and looked at the door; no one was there. He called
again. Then he heard quite distinctly: 'Martin, Martin! Look
<BR>out into the street to-morrow, for I shall come.'

<P>Martin roused himself, rose from his chair and rubbed his eyes, but
did not know whether he had heard these words in a dream or
<BR>awake. He put out the lamp and lay down to sleep.

<P>Next morning he rose before daylight, and after saying his prayers he
lit the fire and prepared his cabbage soup and buckwheat
<BR>porridge. Then he lit the samov&aacute;r, put on his apron, and sat
down by the window to his work. As he sat working Martin thought
<BR>over what had happened the night before. At times it seemed to him
like a dream, and at times he thought that he had really heard
<BR>the voice. 'Such things have happened before now,' thought he.

<P>So he sat by the window, looking out into the street more than he worked,
and whenever any one passed in unfamiliar boots he
<BR>would stoop and look up, so as to see not the feet only but the face
of the passer-by as well. A house-porter passed in new felt
<BR>boots; then a water-carrier. Presently an old soldier of Nicholas'
reign came near the window spade in hand. Martin knew him by
<BR>his boots, which were shabby old felt ones, goloshed with leather.
The old man was called Step&aacute;niteh: a neighbouring tradesman
<BR>kept him in his house for charity, and his duty was to help the house-porter.
He began to clear away the snow before Martin's
<BR>window. Martin glanced at him and then went on with his work.

<P>'I must be growing crazy with age,' said Martin, laughing at his fancy.
'Step&aacute;nitch comes to clear away the snow, and I must needs
<BR>imagine it's Christ coming to visit me. Old dotard that I am!'

<P>Yet after he had made a dozen stitches he felt drawn to look out of
the window again. He saw that Step&aacute;nitch had leaned his
<BR>spade against the wall, and was either resting himself or trying to
get warm. The man was old and broken down, and had evidently
<BR>not enough strength even to clear away the snow.

<P>'What if I called him in and gave him some tea?' thought Martin. 'The
samov&aacute;r is just on the boil.'

<P>He stuck his awl in its place, and rose; and putting the samov&aacute;r
on the table, made tea. Then he tapped the window with his
<BR>fingers. Step&aacute;nitch turned and came to the window. Martin beckoned
to him to come in, and went himself to open the door.

<P>'Come in,' he said, 'and warm yourself a bit. I'm sure you must be cold.'

<P>'May God bless you!' Step&aacute;nitch answered. 'My bones do ache to
be sure.' He came in, first shaking off the snow, and lest he
<BR>should leave marks on the floor he began wiping his feet; but as he
did so he tottered and nearly fell.

<P>'Don't trouble to wipe your feet,' said Martin 'I'll wipe up the floor
-- it's all in the day's work. Come, friend, sit down and have
<BR>some tea.'

<P>Filling two tumblers, he passed one to his visitor, and pouring his
own out into the saucer, began to blow on it.

<P>Step&aacute;niteh emptied his glass, and, turning it upside down, put
the remains of his piece of sugar on the top. He began to express his
<BR>thanks, but it was plain that he would be glad of some more.

<P>'Have another glass,' said Martin, refilling the visitor's tumbler and
his own. But while he drank his tea Martin kept looking out into
<BR>the street.

<P>'Are you expecting any one?' asked the visitor.

<P>'Am I expecting any one? Well, now, I'm ashamed to tell you. It isn't
that I really expect any one; but I heard something last night
<BR>which I can't get out of my mind Whether it was a vision, or only a
fancy, I can't tell. You see, friend, last night I was reading the
<BR>Gospel, about Christ the Lord, how he suffered, and how he walked on
earth. You have heard tell of it, I dare say.'

<P>'I have heard tell of it,' answered Step&aacute;nitch; 'but I'm an ignorant
man and not able to read.'

<P>'Well, you see, I was reading of how he walked on earth. I came to that
part, you know, where he went to a Pharisee who did not
<BR>receive him well. Well, friend, as I read about it, I thought now that
man did not receive Christ the Lord with proper honour.
<BR>Suppose such a thing could happen to such a man as myself, I thought,
what would I not do to receive him! But that man gave him
<BR>no reception at all. Well, friend, as I was thinking of this, I began
to doze, and as I dozed I heard some one call me by name. I got
<BR>up, and thought I heard some one whispering, "Expect me; I will come
to-morrow." This happened twice over. And to tell you the
<BR>truth, it sank so into my mind that, though I am ashamed of it myself,
I keep on expecting him, the dear Lord!'

<P>Step&aacute;nitch shook his head in silence, finished his tumbler and
laid it on its side; but Martin stood it up again and refilled it for him.

<P>'Here drink another glass, bless you! And I was thinking too, how he
walked on earth and despised no one, but went mostly among
<BR>common folk. He went with plain people, and chose his disciples from
among the likes of us, from workmen like us, sinners that
<BR>we are. "He who raises himself," he said, "shall be humbled and he
who humbles himself shall be raised." "You call me Lord," he
<BR>said, "and I will wash your feet." "He who would be first," he said,
"let him be the servant of all; because," he said, "blessed are the
<BR>poor, the humble, the meek, and the merciful."'

<P>Step&aacute;nitch forgot his tea. He was an old man easily moved to
tears, and as he sat and listened the tears ran down his cheeks.

<P>'Come, drink some more,' said Martin. But Step&aacute;nitch crossed
himself, thanked him, moved away his tumbler, and rose.

<P>'Thank you, Martin Avd&eacute;itch,' he said, 'you have given me food
and comfort both for soul and body.'

<P>'You're very welcome. Come again another time. I am glad to have a guest,'
said Martin.

<P>Step&aacute;nitch went away; and Martin poured out the last of the tea
and drank it up. Then he put away the tea things and sat down to
<BR>his work, stitching the back seam of a boot. And as he stitched he
kept looking out of the window, waiting for Christ, and thinking
<BR>about him and his doings. And his head was full of Christ's sayings.

<P>Two soldiers went by: one in Government boots the other in boots of
his own; then the master of a neighbouring house, in shining
<BR>goloshes; then a baker carrying a basket. All these passed on. Then
a woman came up in worsted stockings and peasant-made
<BR>shoes. She passed the window, but stopped by the wall. Martin glanced
up at her through the window, and saw that she was a
<BR>stranger, poorly dressed, and with a baby in her arms. She stopped
by the wall with her back to the wind, trying to wrap the baby
<BR>up though she had hardly anything to wrap it in. The woman had only
summer clothes on, and even they were shabby and worn.
<BR>Through the window Martin heard the baby crying, and the woman trying
to soothe it, but unable to do so. Martin rose and going
<BR>out of the door and up the steps he called to her.

<P>'My dear, I say, my dear!'

<P>The woman heard, and turned round.

<P>'Why do you stand out there with the baby in the cold? Come inside.
You can wrap him up better in a warm place. Come this
<BR>way!'

<P>The woman was surprised to see an old man in an apron, with spectacles
on his nose, calling to her, but she followed him in.

<P>They went down the steps, entered the little room, and the old man led
her to the bed.

<P>'There, sit down, my dear, near the stove. Warm yourself, and feed the
baby.'

<P>'Haven't any milk. I have eaten nothing myself since early morning,'
said the woman, but still she took the baby to her breast.

<P>Martin shook his head. He brought out a basin and some bread. Then he
opened the oven door and poured some cabbage soup
<BR>into the basin. He took out the porridge pot also but the porridge
was not yet ready, so he spread a cloth on the table and served
<BR>only the soup and bread.

<P>'Sit down and eat, my dear, and I'll mind the baby. Why, bless me, I've
had children of my own; I know how to manage them.'

<P>The woman crossed herself, and sitting down at the table began to eat,
while Martin put the baby on the bed and sat down by it.
<BR>He chucked and chucked, but having no teeth he could not do it well
and the baby continued to cry. Then Martin tried poking at
<BR>him with his finger; he drove his finger straight at the baby's mouth
and then quickly drew it back, and did this again and again. He
<BR>did not let the baby take his finger in its mouth, because it was all
black with cobbler's wax. But the baby first grew quiet watching
<BR>the finger, and then began to laugh. And Martin felt quite pleased.

<P>The woman sat eating and talking, and told him who she was, and where
she had been.

<P>'I'm a soldier's wife,' said she. 'They sent my husband somewhere, far
away, eight months ago, and I have heard nothing of him
<BR>since. I had a place as cook till my baby was born, but then they would
not keep me with a child. For three months now I have
<BR>been struggling, unable to find a place, and I've had to sell all I
had for food. I tried to go as a wet-nurse, but no one would have
<BR>me; they said I was too starved-looking and thin. Now I have just been
to see a tradesman's wife (a woman from our village is in
<BR>service with her) and she has promised to take me. I thought it was
all settled at last, but she tells me not to come till next week. It
<BR>is far to her place, and I am fagged out, and baby is quite starved,
poor mite. Fortunately our landlady has pity on us, and lets us
<BR>lodge free, else I don't know what we should do.'

<P>Martin sighed. 'Haven't you any warmer clothing?' he asked.

<P>'How could I get warm clothing?' said she. 'Why I pawned my last shawl
for sixpence yesterday.'

<P>Then the woman came and took the child, and Martin got up. He went and
looked among some things that were hanging on the
<BR>wall, and brought back an old cloak.

<P>'Here,' he said, 'though it's a worn-out old thing, it will do to wrap
him up in.'

<P>The woman looked at the cloak, then at the old man, and taking it, burst
into tears. Martin turned away, and groping under the bed
<BR>brought out a small trunk. He fumbled about in it, and again sat down
opposite the woman. And the woman said:

<P>'The Lord bless you, friend. Surely Christ must have sent me to your
window, else the child would have frozen. It was mild when I
<BR>started, but now see how cold it has turned. Surely it must have been
Christ who made you look out of your window and take pity
<BR>on me, poor wretch!'

<P>Martin smiled and said; 'It is quite true; it was he made me do it.
It was no mere chance made me look out.'

<P>And he told the woman his dream, and how he had heard the Lord's voice
promising to visit him that day.

<P>'Who knows? All things are possible,' said the woman. And she got up
and threw the cloak over her shoulders, wrapping it round
<BR>herself and round the baby. Then she bowed, and thanked Martin once
more.

<P>'Take this for Christ's sake,' said Martin, and gave her sixpence to
get her shawl out of pawn. The woman crossed herself, and
<BR>Martin did the same, and then he saw her out.

<P>After the woman had gone, Martin ate some cabbage soup, cleared the
things away, and sat down to work again. He sat and
<BR>worked, but did not forget the window, and every time a shadow fell
on it he looked up at once to see who was passing. People he
<BR>knew and strangers passed by, but no one remarkable.

<P>After a while Martin saw an apple-woman stop just in front of his window.
She had a large basket, but there did not seem to be
<BR>many apples left in it; she had evidently sold most of her stock. On
her back she had a sack full of chips, which she was taking
<BR>home. No doubt she had gathered them at some place where building was
going on. The sack evidently hurt her, and she wanted
<BR>to shift it from one shoulder to the other, so she put it down on the
footpath and, placing her basket on a post, began to shake down
<BR>the chips in the sack. While she was doing this a boy in a tattered
cap ran up, snatched an apple out of the basket, and tried to slip
<BR>away; but the old woman noticed it, and turning, caught the boy by
his sleeve. He began to struggle, trying to free himself, but the
<BR>old woman held on with both hands, knocked his cap off his head, and
seized hold of his hair. The boy screamed and the old
<BR>woman scolded. Martin dropped his awl, not waiting to stick it in its
place, and rushed out of the door. Stumbling up the steps, and
<BR>dropping his spectacles in his hurry, he ran out into the street. The
old woman was pulling the boy's hair and scolding him, and
<BR>threatening to take him to the police. The lad was struggling and protesting,
saying, 'I did not take it. What are you beating me for?
<BR>Let me go!'

<P>Martin separated them. He took the boy by the hand and said, 'Let him
go, Granny. Forgive him for Christ's sake.'

<P>'I'll pay him out, so that he won't forget it for a year! I'll take
the rascal to the police!'

<P>Martin began entreating the old woman.

<P>'Let him go, Granny. He won't do it again. Let him go for Christ's sake!'

<P>The old woman let go, and the boy wished to run away, but Martin stopped
him

<P>'Ask the Granny's forgiveness!' said he. 'And don't do it another time.
I saw you take the apple.'

<P>The boy began to cry and to beg pardon.

<P>'That's right. And now here's an apple for you, and Martin took an apple
from the basket and gave it to the boy, saying, 'I will pay
<BR>you, Granny.'

<P>'You will spoil them that way, the young rascals,' said the old woman.
'He ought to be whipped so that he should remember it for a
<BR>week.'

<P>'Oh, Granny, Granny,' said Martin, 'that's our way -- but it's not God's
way. If he should be whipped for stealing an apple, what
<BR>should be done to us for our sins?'

<P>The old woman was silent.

<P>And Martin told her the parable of the lord who forgave his servant
a large debt, and how the servant went out and seized his
<BR>debtor by the throat. The old woman listened to it all, and the boy,
too, stood by and listened.

<P>'God bids us forgive,' said Martin, 'or else we shall not be forgiven.
Forgive every one; and a thoughtless youngster most of all.'

<P>The old woman wagged her head and sighed.

<P>'It's true enough,' said she, 'but they are getting terribly spoilt.'

<P>'Then we old ones must show them better ways,' Martin replied.

<P>'That's just what I say,' said the old woman. 'I have had seven of them
myself, and only one daughter is left.' And the old woman
<BR>began to tell how and where she was living with her daughter, and how
many grandchildren she had. 'There now,' she said, 'I have
<BR>but little strength left, yet I work hard for the sake of my grandchildren;
and nice children they are, too. No one comes out to meet
<BR>me but the children. Little Annie, now, won't leave me for any one.
"It's grandmother, dear grandmother, darling grandmother."'
<BR>And the old woman completely softened at the thought.

<P>'Of course, it was only his childishness, God help him,' said she, referring
to the boy.

<P>As the old woman was about to hoist her sack on her back, the lad sprang
forward to her, saying, 'Let me carry it for you, Granny.
<BR>I'm going that way.'

<P>The old woman nodded her head, and put the sack on the boy's back, and
they went down the street together, the old woman quite
<BR>forgetting to ask Martin to pay for the apple. Martin stood and watched
them as they went along talking to each other.

<P>When they were out of sight Martin went back to the house. Having found
his spectacles unbroken on the steps, he picked up his
<BR>awl and sat down again to work. He worked a little, but could soon
not see to pass the bristle through the holes in the leather; and
<BR>presently he noticed the lamplighter passing on his way to light the
street lamps.

<P>'Seems it's time to light up,' thought he. So he trimmed his lamp, hung
it up, and sat down again to work. He finished off one boot
<BR>and, turning it about, examined it. It was all right. Then he gathered
his tools together, swept up the cuttings, put away the bristles
<BR>and the thread and the awls, and, taking down the lamp, placed it on
the table. Then he took the Gospels from the shelf. He meant
<BR>to open them at the place he had marked the day before with a bit of
morocco, but the book opened at another place. As Martin
<BR>opened it, his yesterday's dream came back to his mind, and no sooner
had he thought of it than he seemed to hear footsteps, as
<BR>though some one were moving behind him. Martin turned round, and it
seemed to him as if people were standing in the dark
<BR>corner, but he could not make out who they were. And a voice whispered
in his ear: 'Martin, Martin, don't you know me?'

<P>'Who is it?' muttered Martin.

<P>'It is I,' said the voice. And out of the dark corner stepped Step&aacute;nitch,
who smiled and vanishing like a cloud was seen no more.

<P>'It is I,' said the voice again. And out of the darkness stepped the
woman with the baby in her arms and the woman smiled and the
<BR>baby laughed, and they too vanished.

<P>'It is I,' said the voice once more. And the old woman and the boy with
the apple stepped out and both smiled, and then they too
<BR>vanished.

<P>And Martin's soul grew glad. He crossed himself put on his spectacles,
and began reading the Gospel just where it had opened;
<BR>and at the top of the page he read

<P>'I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me
drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in.'

<P>And at the bottom of the page he read

<P>'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren even these least,
ye did it unto me' (Matt. xxv).

<P>And Martin understood that his dream had come true; and that the Saviour
had really come to him that day, and he had welcomed
<BR>him.
