<P>IT was an early Easter. Sledging was only just over; snow still lay
in the yards; and water ran in streams down the village street.

<P>Two little girls from different houses happened to meet in a lane between
two homesteads, where the dirty water after running
<BR>through the farm-yards had formed a large puddle. One girl was very
small, the other a little bigger. Their mothers had dressed
<BR>them both in new frocks. The little one wore a blue frock the other
a yellow print, and both had red kerchiefs on their heads. They
<BR>had just come from church when they met, and first they showed each
other their finery, and then they began to play. Soon the
<BR>fancy took them to splash about in the water, and the smaller one was
going to step into the puddle, shoes and all, when the elder
<BR>checked her:

<P>'Don't go in so, Mal&aacute;sha,' said she, 'your mother will scold
you. I will take off my shoes and stockings, and you take off yours.'

<P>They did so, and then, picking up their skirts, began walking towards
each other through the puddle. The water came up to
<BR>Mal&aacute;sha's ankles, and she said:

<P>'It is deep, Ako&uacute;lya, I'm afraid!'

<P>'Come on,' replied the other. 'Don't be frightened. It won't get any
deeper.'

<P>When they got near one another, Ako&uacute;lya said:

<P>'Mind, Mal&aacute;sha, don't splash. Walk carefully!'

<P>She had hardly said this, when Mal&aacute;sha plumped down her foot
so that the water splashed right on to Ako&uacute;lya's frock. The frock
<BR>was splashed, and so were Ako&uacute;lya's eyes and nose. When she
saw the stains on her frock, she was angry and ran after Mal&aacute;sha
<BR>to strike her. Mal&aacute;sha was frightened, and seeing that she had
got herself into trouble, she scrambled out of the puddle, and
<BR>prepared to run home. Just then Ako&uacute;lya's mother happened to
be passing, and seeing that her daughter's skirt was splashed, and
<BR>her sleeves dirty, she said:

<P>'You naughty, dirty girl, what have you been doing?'

<P>'Mal&aacute;sha did it on purpose,' replied the girl.

<P>At this Ako&uacute;lya's mother seized Mal&aacute;sha, and struck her
on the back of her neck. Mal&aacute;sha began to howl so that she could
be
<BR>heard all down the street. Her mother came out.

<P>'What are you beating my girl for?' said she; and began scolding her
neighbour. One word led to another and they had an angry
<BR>quarrel. The men came out and a crowd collected in the street, every
one shouting and no one listening. They all went on
<BR>quarrelling, till one gave another a push, and the affair had very
nearly come to blows, when Ako&uacute;lya's old grandmother, stepping
<BR>in among them, tried to calm them.

<P>'What are you thinking of, friends? Is it right to behave so? On a day
like this, too! It is a time for rejoicing, and not for such folly
<BR>as this.'

<P>They would not listen to the old woman and nearly knocked her off her
feet. And she would not have been able to quiet the
<BR>crowd, if it had not been for Ako&uacute;lya and Mal&aacute;sha themselves.
While the women were abusing each other, Ako&uacute;lya had wiped
<BR>the mud off her frock, and gone back to the puddle. She took a stone
and began scraping away the earth in front of the puddle to
<BR>make a channel through which the water could run out into the street.
Presently Mal&aacute;sha joined her, and with a chip of wood
<BR>helped her dig the channel. Just as the men were beginning to fight,
the water from the little girls' channel ran streaming into the
<BR>street towards the very place where the old woman was trying to pacify
the men. The girls followed it; one running each side of
<BR>the little stream.

<P>'Catch it, Mal&aacute;sha! Catch it!' shouted Ako&uacute;lya; while
Mal&aacute;sha could not speak for laughing.

<P>Highly delighted, and watching the chip float along on their stream,
the little girls ran straight into the group of men; and the old
<BR>woman, seeing them, said to the men:

<P>'Are you not ashamed of yourselves? To go fighting on account of these
lassies, when they themselves have forgotten all about it,
<BR>and are playing happily together. Dear little souls! They are wiser
than you!'

<P>The men looked at the little girls, and were ashamed, and, laughing
at themselves, went back each to his own home.

<P>'Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise
enter into the kingdom of heaven.'
