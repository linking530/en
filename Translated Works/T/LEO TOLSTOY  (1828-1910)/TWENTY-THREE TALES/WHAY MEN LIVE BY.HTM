<P>'We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love
the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.' -- I
<BR>Epistle St. John iii. 14.

<P>'Whoso hath the world's goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and
shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love
<BR>of God abide in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither
with the tongue; but in deed and truth.' -- iii. 17-18.

<P>'Love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth
God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for
<BR>God is love.' -- iv. 7-8.

<P>'No man hath beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abideth
in us.' -- iv. 12.

<P>'God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth
in him.' -- iv. 16.

<P>'If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he
<BR>love God whom he hath not seen?' -- iv. 20.

<P>I

<P>A SHOEMAKER named Simon, who had neither house nor land of his own,
lived with his wife and children in a peasant's hut,
<BR>and earned his living by his work. Work was cheap but bread was dear,
and what he earned he spent for food. The man and
<BR>his wife had but one sheepskin coat between them for winter wear, and
even that was worn to tatters, and this was the second
<BR>year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins for a new coat. Before
winter Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble note
<BR>lay hidden in his wife's box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks[6]
were owed him by customers in the village.

<P>So one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins.
He put on over his shirt his wife's wadded nankeen
<BR>jacket, and over that he put his own cloth coat. He took the three-rouble
note in his pocket, cut himself a stick to serve as a
<BR>staff, and started off after breakfast. 'I'll collect the five roubles
that are due to me,' thought he, 'add the three I have got, and
<BR>that will be enough to buy sheep-skins for the winter coat.'

<P>He came to the village and called at a peasant's hut, but the man was
not at home. The peasant's wife promised that the money
<BR>should be paid next week, but she would not pay it herself. Then Simon
called on another peasant, but this one swore he had
<BR>no money, and would only pay twenty kopeks which he owed for a pair
of boots Simon had mended. Simon then tried to buy
<BR>the sheep-skins on credit, but the deader would not trust him.

<P>'Bring your money,' said he, 'then you may have your pick of the skins.
We know what debt-collecting is like.'

<P>So all the business the shoemaker did was to get the twenty kopeks for
boots he had mended, and to take a pair of felt boots a
<BR>peasant gave him to sole with leather.

<P>Simon felt downhearted. He spent the twenty kopeks on v&oacute;dka,
and started homewards without having bought any skins. In
<BR>the morning he had felt the frost; but now, after drinking the v&oacute;dka,
he felt warm even without a sheep-skin coat. He trudged
<BR>along, striking his stick on the frozen earth with one hand, swinging
the felt boots with the other, and talking to himself.

<P>'I'm quite warm,' said he, 'though I have no sheepskin coat. I've had
a drop, and it runs through all my veins. I need no
<BR>sheepskins. I go along and don't worry about anything. That's the sort
of man I am! What do I care? I can live without sheep
<BR>skins. I don't need them. My wife will fret, to be sure. And, true
enough, it's a shame; one works all day long, and then does
<BR>not get paid. Stop a bit! If you don't bring that money along, sure
enough I'll skin you, blessed if I don't. How's that? He pays
<BR>twenty kopeks at a time! What can I do with twenty kopeks: Drink it
-- that's all one can do! Hard up, he says he is! So he
<BR>may be -- but what about me? You have house, and cattle, and everything;
I've only what I stand up in! You have corn of your
<BR>own growing; I have to buy every grain. Do what I will, I must spend
three roubles every week for bread alone. I come home
<BR>and find the bread all used up, and I have to fork out another rouble
and a half. So just you pay up what you owe, and no
<BR>nonsense about it!'

<P>By this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road.
Looking up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine.
<BR>The daylight was fading, and the shoemaker peered at the thing without
being able to make out what it was. 'There was no
<BR>white stone here before. Can it be an ox? It's not like an ox. It has
a head like a man, but it's too white; and what could a man
<BR>be doing there?'

<P>He came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it really
was a man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless
<BR>against the shrine. Terror seized the shoemaker, and he thought, 'Some
one has killed him, stripped him, and left him here. If I
<BR>meddle I shall surely get into trouble.'

<P>So the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he
could not see the man. When he had gone some way, he
<BR>looked back, and saw that the man was no longer leaning against the
shrine, but was moving as if looking towards him. The
<BR>shoemaker felt more frightened than before, and thought, 'Shall I go
back to him, or shall I go on? If I go near him something
<BR>dreadful may happen. Who knows who the fellow is? He has not come here
for any good. If I go near him he may jump up and
<BR>throttle me, and there will be no getting away. Or if not, he'd still
be a burden on one's hands. What could I do with a naked
<BR>man? I couldn't give him my last clothes. Heaven only help me to get
away!'

<P>So the shoemaker hurried on, leaving the shrine behind him -- when suddenly
his conscience smote him and he stopped in the
<BR>road.

<P>'What are you doing, Simon?' said he to himself. 'The man may be dying
of want, and you slip past afraid. Have you grown so
<BR>rich as to be afraid of robbers? Ah, Simon, shame on you!'

<P>So he turned back and went up to the man.

<P>II

<P>Simon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was a
young man, fit, with no bruises on his body, only
<BR>evidently freezing and frightened, and he sat there leaning back without
looking up at Simon, as if too faint to lift his eyes. Simon
<BR>went close to him, and then the man seemed to wake up. Turning his
head, he opened his eyes and looked into Simon's face.
<BR>That one look was enough to make Simon fond of the man. He threw the
felt boots on the ground undid his sash, laid it on the
<BR>boots, and took off his cloth coat.

<P>'It's not a time for talking,' said he. 'Come, put this coat on at once!'
And Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to
<BR>rise. As he stood there, Simon saw that his body was clean and in good
condition, his hands and feet shapely, and his face
<BR>good and kind. He threw his coat over the man's shoulders but the latter
could not find the sleeves. Simon guided his arms into
<BR>them, and drawing the coat well on trapped it closely about him, tying
the sash round the man's waist.

<P>Simon even took off his torn cap to put it on the man's head, but then
his own head felt cold, and he thought: 'I'm quite bald,
<BR>while he has long curly hair.' So he put his cap on his own head again.
'It will be better to give him something for his feet,'
<BR>thought he; and he made the man sit down, and helped him to put on
the felt boots, saying, 'There, friend, now move about and
<BR>warm yourself. Other matters can be settled later on. Can you walk?'

<P>The man stood up and looked kindly at Simon, but could not say a word.

<P>'Why don't you speak?' said Simon. 'It's too cold to stay here; we must
be getting home. There now, take my stick, and if
<BR>you're feeling weak, lean on that. Now step out!'

<P>The man started walking, and moved easily, not lagging behind.

<P>As they went along, Simon asked him, 'And where do you belong to?'

<P>'I'm not from these parts.'

<P>'I thought as much. I know the folks hereabouts. But how did you come
to be there by the shrine?'

<P>'I cannot tell.'

<P>'Has some one been ill-treating you?'

<P>'No one has ill-treated me. God has punished me.

<P>'Of course God rules all. Still, you'll have to find food and shelter
somewhere. Where do you want to go to?'

<P>'It is all the same to me.'

<P>Simon was amazed. The man did not look like a rogue, and he spoke gently,
but yet he gave no account of himself. Still Simon
<BR>thought, 'Who knows what may have happened?' And he said to the stranger:
'Well then, come home with me, and at least
<BR>warm yourself awhile.'

<P>So Simon walked towards his home, and the stranger kept up with him,
walking at his side. The wind had risen and Simon felt
<BR>it cold under his shirt. He was getting over his tipsiness by now,
and began to feel the frost. He went along sniffling and
<BR>wrapping his wife's coat round him, and he thought to himself: 'There
now -- talk about sheepskins! I went out for sheepskins
<BR>and come home without even a coat to my back and what is more, I'm
bringing a naked man along with me. Matry&oacute;na won't
<BR>be pleased!' And when he thought of his wife he felt sad; but when
he looked at the stranger and remembered how he had
<BR>looked up at him at the shrine, his heart was glad.

<P>III

<P>Simon's wife had everything ready early that day. She had cut wood,
brought water, fed the children eaten her own meal, and
<BR>now she sat thinking. She wondered when she ought to make bread: now
or to-morrow? There was still a large piece left.

<P>'If Simon has had some dinner in town,' thought she, and does not eat
much for supper, the bread will last out another day.'

<P>She weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought:
'I won't make any more to-day. We have only
<BR>enough flour left to bake one batch. We can manage to make this last
out till Friday.'

<P>So Matry&oacute;na put away the bread, and sat down at the table to
patch her husband's shirt. While she worked she thought how
<BR>her husband was buying skins for a winter coat.

<P>'If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple;
he cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight
<BR>roubles is a lot of money -- he should get a good coat at that price.
Not tanned skins, but still a proper winter coat. How
<BR>difficult it was last winter to get on without a warm coat. I could
neither get down to the river, nor go out anywhere. When he
<BR>went out he put on all we had, and there was nothing left for me. He
did not start very early to-day, but still it's time he was
<BR>back. I only hope he has not gone on the spree!'

<P>Hardly had Matry&oacute;na thought this, when steps were heard on the
threshold, and some one entered. Matry&oacute;na stuck her needle
<BR>into her work and went out into the passage. There she saw two men:
Simon, and with him a man without a hat, and wearing
<BR>felt boots.

<P>Matry&oacute;na noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. 'There
now, he has been drinking,' thought she. And when she saw
<BR>that he was coatless, had only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood
there silent, and seemed ashamed, her heart was ready
<BR>to break with disappointment. 'He has drunk the money,' thought she,
'and has been on the spree with some good-for-nothing
<BR>fellow whom he has brought home with him.'

<P>Matry&oacute;na let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw
that the stranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband's
<BR>coat. There was no shirt to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having
entered, he stood neither moving, nor raising his eyes,
<BR>and Matry&oacute;na thought: 'He must be a bad man -- he's afraid.'

<P>Matry&oacute;na frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what
they would do.

<P>Simon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all
right.

<P>'Come, Matry&oacute;na; if supper is ready, let us have some.'

<P>Matry&oacute;na muttered something to herself and did not move, but
stayed where she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one
<BR>and then at the other of them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that
his wife was annoyed, but tried to pass it off.
<BR>Pretending not to notice anything, he took the stranger by the arm.

<P>'Sit down, friend,' said he, 'and let us have some supper.'

<P>The stranger sat down on the bench.

<P>'Haven't you cooked anything for us?' said Simon.

<P>Matry&oacute;na's anger boiled over. 'I've cooked, but not for you.
It seems to me you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy
<BR>a sheep-skin coat, but come home without so much as the coat you had
on, and bring a naked vagabond home with you. I
<BR>have no supper for drunkards like you.'

<P>'That's enough, Matry&oacute;na. Don't wag your tongue without reason!
You had better ask what sort of man --'

<P>'And you tell me what you've done with the money?'

<P>Simon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-rouble note,
and unfolded it.

<P>'Here is the money. Tr&iacute;fonof did not pay, but promises to pay
soon.'

<P>Matry&oacute;na got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins,
but had put his only coat on some naked fellow and had even
<BR>brought him to their house.

<P>She snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety,
and said: 'I have no supper for you. We can't feed all the
<BR>naked drunkards in the world.'

<P>'There now, Matry&oacute;na, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what
a man has to say!'

<P>'Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool. I was right in not wanting
to marry you -- a drunkard. The linen my mother
<BR>gave me you drank; and now you've been to buy a coat -- and have drunk
it too!'

<P>Simon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks;
tried to tell how he had found the man -- but Matry&oacute;na
<BR>would not let him get a word in. She talked nineteen to the dozen,
and dragged in things that had happened ten years before.

<P>Matry&oacute;na talked and talked, and at last she flew at Simon and
seized him by the sleeve.

<P>'Give me my jacket. It is the only one I have and you must needs take
it from me and wear it yourself. Give it here, you mangy
<BR>dog, and may the devil take you.'

<P>Simon began to pull off the jacket, and turned a sleeve of it inside
out; Matry&oacute;na seized the jacket and it burst its seams. She
<BR>snatched it up, threw it over her head and went to the door. She meant
to go out, but stopped undecided -- she wanted to
<BR>work off her anger, but she also wanted to learn what sort of a man
the stranger was.

<P>IV

<P>Matry&oacute;na stopped and said: 'If he were a good man he would not
be naked. Why, he hasn't even a shirt on him. If he were all
<BR>right, you would say where you came across the fellow.'

<P>'That's just what I am trying to tell you,' said Simon. 'As I came to
the shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn't quite
<BR>the weather to sit about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have
perished. What was I to do? How do we know what
<BR>may have happened to him? So I took him, clothed him, and brought him
along. Don't be so angry, Matry&oacute;na. It is a sin.
<BR>Remember, we all must die one day.'

<P>Angry words rose to Matry&oacute;na's lips, but she looked at the stranger
and was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench,
<BR>motionless, his hands folded on his knees, his head drooping on his
breast, his eyes closed, and his brows knit as if in pain.
<BR>Matry&oacute;na was silent, and Simon said: 'Matry&oacute;na, have
you no love of God?'

<P>Matry&oacute;na heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger,
suddenly her heart softened towards him. She came back from
<BR>the door, and going to the oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup
on the table, she poured out some kvas[7]. Then she
<BR>brought out the last piece of bread, and set out a knife and spoons.

<P>'Eat, if you want to,' said she.

<P>Simon drew the stranger to the table.

<P>'Take your place, young man,' said he.

<P>Simon cut the bread, crumbled it into the broth, and they began to eat.
Matry&oacute;na sat at the corner of the table, resting her head
<BR>on her hand and looking at the stranger.

<P>And Matry&oacute;na was touched with pity for the stranger, and began
to feel fond of him. And at once the stranger's face lit up; his
<BR>brows were no longer bent, he raised his eyes and smiled at Matry&oacute;na.

<P>When they had finished supper, the woman cleared away the things and
began questioning the stranger. 'Where are you from?'
<BR>said she.

<P>'I am not from these parts.'

<P>'But how did you come to be on the road?'

<P>'I may not tell.'

<P>'Did some one rob you?'

<P>'God punished me.'

<P>'And you were lying there naked?'

<P>'Yes, naked and freezing. Simon saw me and had pity on me. He took off
his coat, put it on me and brought me here. And you
<BR>have fed me, given me drink, and shown pity on me. God will reward
you!'

<P>Matry&oacute;na rose, took from the window Simon's old shirt she had
been patching, and gave it to the stranger. She also brought
<BR>out a pair of trousers for him.

<P>'There,' said she, 'I see you have no shirt. Put this on, and lie down
where you please, in the loft or on the oven[8].'

<P>The stranger took off the coat, put on the shirt, and lay down in the
loft. Matry&oacute;na put out the candle, took the coat, and
<BR>climbed to where her husband lay.

<P>Matry&oacute;na drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down, but
could not sleep; she could not get the stranger out of her mind.

<P>When she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and
that there was none for to-morrow and thought of the
<BR>shirt and trousers she had given away, she felt grieved; but when she
remembered how he had smiled, her heart was glad.

<P>Long did Matry&oacute;na lie awake, and she noticed that Simon also
was awake -- he drew the coat towards him.

<P>'Simon!'

<P>'Well?'

<P>'You have had the last of the bread, and I have not put any to rise.
I don't know what we shall do tomorrow. Perhaps I can
<BR>borrow some of neighbour Martha.'

<P>'If we're alive we shall find something to eat.'

<P>The woman lay still awhile, and then said, 'He seems a good man, but
why does he not tell us who he is?'

<P>'I suppose he has his reasons.'

<P>'Simon!'

<P>'Well?'

<P>'We give; but why does nobody give us anything?'

<P>Simon did not know what to say; so he only said, 'Let us stop talking,'
and turned over and went to sleep.

<P>V

<P>In the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife
had gone to the neighbour's to borrow some bread. The
<BR>stranger alone was sitting on the bench, dressed in the old shirt and
trousers, and looking upwards. His face was brighter than it
<BR>had been the day before.

<P>Simon said to him, 'Well, friend; the belly wants bread and the naked
body clothes. One has to work for a living. What work
<BR>do you know?'

<P>'I do not know any.'

<P>This surprised Simon, but he said, 'Men who want to learn can learn
anything.'

<P>'Men work, and I will work also.'

<P>'What is your name?'

<P>'Michael.'

<P>'Well Michael, if you don't wish to talk about yourself that is your
own affair; but you'll have to earn a living for yourself. If you
<BR>will work as I tell you, I will give you food and shelter.'

<P>'May God reward you! I will learn. Show me what to do.'

<P>Simon took yarn, put it round his thumb and began to twist it.

<P>'It is easy enough -- see!'

<P>Michael watched him, put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way,
caught the knack, and twisted the yarn also.

<P>Then Simon showed him how to wax the thread. This also Michael mastered.
Next Simon showed him how to twist the bristle
<BR>in, and how to sew, and this, too, Michael learned at once.

<P>Whatever Simon showed him he understood at once, and after three days
he worked as if he had sewn boots all his life. He
<BR>worked without stopping, and ate little. When work was over he sat
silently, looking upwards. He hardly went into the street,
<BR>spoke only when necessary, and neither joked nor laughed. They never
saw him smile, except that first evening when Matry&oacute;na
<BR>gave them supper.

<P>VI

<P>Day by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and worked
with Simon. His fame spread till people said
<BR>that no one sewed boots so neatly and strongly as Simon's workman,
Michael; and from all the district round people came to
<BR>Simon for their boots, and he began to be well off.

<P>One winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working a carriage on sledge-runners,
with three horses and with bells, drove up to
<BR>the hut. They looked out of the window; the carriage stopped at their
door, a fine servant jumped down from the box and
<BR>opened the door. A gentleman in a fur coat got out and walked up to
Simon's hut. Up jumped Matry&oacute;na and opened the door
<BR>wide. The gentleman stooped to enter the hut, and when he drew himself
up again his head nearly reached the ceiling, and he
<BR>seemed quite to fill his end of the room.

<P>Simon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He
had never seen any one like him. Simon himself was
<BR>lean, Michael was thin, and Matry&oacute;na was dry as a bone, but
this man was like some one from another world: red-faced, burly,
<BR>with a neck like a bull's, and looking altogether as if he were cast
in iron.

<P>The gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench,
and said, 'Which of you is the master bootmaker?'

<P>'I am, your Excellency,' said Simon, coming forward.

<P>Then the gentleman shouted to his lad, 'Hey, F&eacute;dka, bring the
leather!'

<P>The servant ran in, bringing a parcel. The gentleman took the parcel
and put it on the table.

<P>'Untie it' said he. The lad untied it.

<P>The gentleman pointed to the leather.

<P>'Look here, shoemaker,' said he, 'do you see this leather?'

<P>'Yes, your honour.'

<P>'But do you know what sort of leather it is?'

<P>Simon felt the leather and said, 'It is good leather.'

<P>'Good, indeed! Why, you fool, you never saw such leather before in your
life. It's German, and cost twenty roubles.'

<P>Simon was frightened, and said, 'Where should I ever see leather like
that?'

<P>'Just so! Now, can you make it into boots for me?'

<P>'Yes, your Excellency, I can.'

<P>Then the gentleman shouted at him: 'You can, can you? Well, remember
whom you are to make them for, and what the leather
<BR>is. You must make me boots that will wear for a year, neither losing
shape nor coming unsewn. If you can do it, take the leather
<BR>and cut it up; but if you can't, say so. I warn you now, if your boots
come unsewn or lose shape within a year, I will have you
<BR>put in prison. If they don't burst or lose shape for a year, I will
pay you ten roubles for your work.'

<P>Simon was frightened, and did not know what to say. He glanced at Michael
and nudging him with his elbow, whispered: 'Shall
<BR>I take the work?'

<P>Michael nodded his head as if to say, 'Yes, take it.'

<P>Simon did as Michael advised, and undertook to make boots that would
not lose shape or split for a whole year.

<P>Calling his servant, the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his
left leg, which he stretched out.

<P>'Take my measure!' said he.

<P>Simon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long, smoothed it out,
knelt down, wiped his hands well on his apron so as
<BR>not to soil the gentleman's sock, and began to measure. He measured
the sole, and round the instep, and began to measure the
<BR>calf of the leg, but the paper was too short. The calf of the leg was
as thick as a beam.

<P>'Mind you don't make it too tight in the leg.'

<P>Simon stitched on another strip of paper. The gentleman twitched his
toes about in his sock, looking round at those in the hut,
<BR>and as he did so he noticed Michael.

<P>'Whom have you there?' asked he

<P>'That is my workman. He will sew the boots.'

<P>'Mind,' said the gentleman to Michael, 'remember to make them so that
they will last me a year.'

<P>Simon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at
the gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind
<BR>the gentleman, as if he saw some one there. Michael looked and looked,
and suddenly he smiled, and his face became brighter.

<P>'What are you grinning at, you fool?' thundered the gentleman. 'You
had better look to it that the boots are ready in time.'

<P>'They shall be ready in good time,' said Michael.

<P>'Mind it is so,' said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his
fur coat, wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door.
<BR>But he forgot to stoop and struck his head against the lintel.

<P>He swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage
and drove away.

<P>When he had gone, Simon said: 'There's a figure of a man for you! You
could not kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out
<BR>the lintel, but little harm it did him.'

<P>And Matry&oacute;na said: 'Living as he does, how should he not grow
strong? Death itself can't touch such a rock as that.'

<P>VII

<P>Then Simon said to Michael: 'Well, we have taken the work, but we must
see we don't get into trouble over it. The leather is
<BR>dear, and the gentleman hot-tempered. We must make no mistakes. Come,
your eye is truer and your hands have become
<BR>nimbler than mine, so you take this measure and cut out the boots.
I will finish off the sewing of the vamps.'

<P>Michael did as he was told. He took the leather spread it out on the
table, folded it in two, took a knife and began to cut out.

<P>Matry&oacute;na came and watched him cutting, and was surprised to see
how he was doing it. Matry&oacute;na was accustomed to seeing
<BR>boots made, and she looked and saw that Michael was not cutting the
leather for boots, but was cutting it round.

<P>She wished to say something, but she thought to herself: 'Perhaps I
do not understand how gentlemen's boots should be made.
<BR>I suppose Michael knows more about it -- and I won't interfere.'

<P>When Michael had cut up the leather, he took a thread and began to sew
not with two ends, as boots are sewn, but with a
<BR>single end, as for soft slippers.

<P>Again Matry&oacute;na wondered, but again she did not interfere. Michael
sewed on steadily till noon. Then Simon rose for dinner,
<BR>looked around, and saw that Michael had made slippers out of the gentleman's
leather.

<P>'Ah!' groaned Simon, and he thought, 'How is it that Michael, who has
been with me a whole year and never made a mistake
<BR>before, should do such a dreadful thing? The gentleman ordered high
boots, welted, with whole fronts, and Michael has made
<BR>soft slippers with single soles, and has wasted the leather. What am
I to say to the gentleman? I can never replace leather such
<BR>as this.'

<P>And he said to Michael, 'What are you doing friend? You have ruined
me! You know the gentleman ordered high booth but
<BR>see what you have made!'

<P>Hardly had he begun to rebuke Michael, when 'rat-tat , went the iron
ring that hung at the door. Some one was knocking. They
<BR>looked out of the window; a man had come on horseback, and was fastening
his horse. They opened the door, and the servant
<BR>who had been with the gentleman came in.

<P>'Good day,' said he.

<P>'Good day,' replied Simon. 'What can we do for you?'

<P>'My mistress has sent me about the boots.'

<P>'What about the boots?'

<P>'Why, my master no longer needs them. He is dead.'

<P>'Is it possible?'

<P>'He did not live to get home after leaving you, but died in the carriage.
When we reached home and the servants came to help
<BR>him alight he rolled over like a sack. He was dead already, and so
stiff that he could hardly be got out of the carriage. My
<BR>mistress sent me here, saying: "Tell the bootmaker that the gentleman
who ordered boots of him and left the leather for them no
<BR>longer needs the boots, but that he must quickly make soft slippers
for the corpse. Wait till they are ready, and bring them back
<BR>with you." That is why I have come.'

<P>Michael gathered up the remnants of the leather; rolled them up, took
the soft slippers he had made, slapped them together,
<BR>wiped them down with his apron, and handed them and the roll of leather
to the servant, who took them and said: 'Good-bye,
<BR>masters and good day to you!'

<P>VIII

<P>Another year passed, and another, and Michael was now living his sixth
year with Simon. He lived as before. He went
<BR>nowhere, only spoke when necessary, and had only smiled twice in all
those years -- once when Matry&oacute;na gave him food, and
<BR>a second time when the gentleman was in their hut. Simon was more than
pleased with his workman. He never now asked him
<BR>where he came from, and only feared lest Michael should go away.

<P>They were all at home one day. Matry&oacute;na was putting iron pots
in the oven, the children were running along the benches and
<BR>looking out of the window; Simon was sewing at one window, and Michael
was fastening on a heel at the other.

<P>One of the boys ran along the bench to Michael, leant on his shoulder,
and looked out of the window.

<P>'Look, Uncle Michael! There is a lady with little girls! She seems to
be coming here. And one of the girls is lame.'

<P>When the boy said that, Michael dropped his work, turned to the window,
and looked out into the street.

<P>Simon was surprised. Michael never used to look out into the street,
but now he pressed against the window, staring at
<BR>something. Simon also looked out, and saw that a well-dressed woman
was really coming to his hut, leading by the hand two
<BR>little girls in fur coats and woollen shawls. The girls could hardly
be told one from the other, except that one of them was
<BR>crippled in her left leg and walked with a limp.

<P>The woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage. Feeling about
for the entrance she found the latch, which she
<BR>lifted, and opened the door. She let the two girls go in first, and
followed them into the hut.

<P>'Good day, good folk!'

<P>'Pray come in,' said Simon. 'What can we do for you?'

<P>The woman sat down by the table. The two little girls pressed close
to her knees, afraid of the people in the hut.

<P>'I want leather shoes made for these two little girls, for spring.'

<P>'We can do that. We never have made such small shoes, but we can make
them; either welted or turnover shoes, linen lined.
<BR>My man, Michael, is a master at the work.'

<P>Simon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was sitting
with his eyes fixed on the little girls. Simon was
<BR>surprised. It was true the girls were pretty, with black eyes, plump,
and rosy-cheeked, and they wore nice kerchiefs and fur
<BR>coats, but still Simon could not understand why Michael should look
at them like that -- just as if he had known them before.
<BR>He was puzzled, but went on talking with the woman, and arranging the
price. Having fixed it, he prepared the measure. The
<BR>woman lifted the lame girl on to her lap and said: 'Take two measures
from this little girl. Make one shoe for the lame foot and
<BR>three for the sound one. They both have the same sized feet. They are
twins.'

<P>Simon took the measure and, speaking of the lame girl, said: 'How did
it happen to her? She is such a pretty girl. Was she born
<BR>so?'

<P>'No, her mother crushed her leg.'

<P>Then Matry&oacute;na joined in. She wondered who this woman was, and
whose the children were, so she said: 'Are not you their
<BR>mother, then?'

<P>'No, my good woman, I am neither their mother nor any relation to them.
They were quite strangers to me, but I adopted them.'

<P>'They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them?'

<P>'How can I help being fond of them? I fed them both at my own breasts.
I had a child of my own, but God took him. I was not
<BR>so fond of him as I now am of them.'

<P>'Then whose children are they?'

<P>IX

<P>The woman, having begun talking, told them the whole story.

<P>'It is about six years since their parents died, both in one week: their
father was buried on the Tuesday, and their mother died
<BR>on the Friday. These orphans were born three days after their father's
death, and their mother did not live another day. My
<BR>husband and I were then living as peasants in the village. We were
neighbours of theirs, our yard being next to theirs. Their
<BR>father was a lonely man; a wood-cutter in the forest. When felling
trees one day, they let one fall on him. It fell across his body
<BR>and crushed his bowels out. They hardly got him home before his soul
went to God; and that same week his wife gave birth to
<BR>twins -- these little girls. She was poor and alone; she had no one,
young or old, with her. Alone she gave them birth, and alone
<BR>she met her death.

<P>'The next morning I went to see her, but when I entered the hut, she,
poor thing, was already stark and cold. In dying she had
<BR>rolled on to this child and crushed her leg. The village folk came
to the hut washed the body, laid her out, made a coffin, and
<BR>buried her. They were good folk. The babies were left alone. What was
to be done with them? I was the only woman there
<BR>who had a baby at the time. I was nursing my first-born -- eight weeks
old. So I took them for a time. The peasants came
<BR>together, and thought and thought what to do with them, and at last
they said to me: "For the present, Mary, you had better
<BR>keep the girls, and later on we will arrange what to do for them."
So I nursed the sound one at my breast, but at first I did not
<BR>feed this crippled one. I did not suppose she would live. But then
I thought to myself, why should the poor innocent suffer? I
<BR>pitied her, and began to feed her. And so I fed my own boy and these
two -- the three of them -- at my own breast. I was
<BR>young and strong, and had good food, and God gave me so much milk that
at times it even overflowed. I used sometimes to
<BR>feed two at a time, while the third was waiting. When one had had enough
I nursed the third. And God so ordered it that these
<BR>grew up, while my own was buried before he was two years old. And I
had no more children, though we prospered. Now my
<BR>husband is working for the corn merchant at the mill. The pay is good
and we are well off. But I have no children of my own,
<BR>and how lonely I should be without these little girls! How can I help
loving them! They are the joy of my life!'

<P>She pressed the lame little girl to her with one hand while with the
other she wiped the tears from her cheeks.

<P>And Matry&oacute;na sighed, and said: 'The proverb is true that says,
"One may live without father or mother, but one cannot live
<BR>without God."'

<P>So they talked together, when suddenly the whole hut was lighted up
as though by summer lightning from the corner where
<BR>Michael sat. They all looked towards him and saw him sitting, his hands
folded on his knees, gazing upwards and smiling.

<P>X

<P>The woman went away with the girls. Michael rose from the bench, put
down his work, and took off his apron. Then, bowing
<BR>low to Simon and his wife, he said: 'Farewell, masters. God has forgiven
me. I ask your forgiveness, too, for anything done
<BR>amiss.'

<P>And they saw that a light shone from Michael. And Simon rose, bowed
down to Michael, and said: 'I see, Michael, that you
<BR>are no common man, and I can neither keep you nor question you. Only
tell me this: how is it that when I found you and
<BR>brought you home, you were gloomy, and when my wife gave you food you
smiled at her and became brighter? Then when the
<BR>gentleman came to order the boots, you smiled again and became brighter
still? And now, when this woman brought the little
<BR>girls, you smiled a third time, and have become as bright as day? Tell
me, Michael, why does your face shine so, and why did
<BR>you smile those three times?'

<P>And Michael answered: 'Light shines from me because I have been punished,
but now God has pardoned me. And I smiled
<BR>three times, because God sent me to learn three truths, and I have
learnt them. One I learnt when your wife pitied me and that is
<BR>why I smiled the first time. The second I learnt when the rich man
ordered the boots and then I smiled again. And now, when I
<BR>saw those little girls, I learnt the third and last truth, and I smiled
the third time.'

<P>And Simon said, 'Tell me, Michael, what did God punish you for? and
what were the three truths? that I, too, may know them.'

<P>And Michael answered: 'God punished me for disobeying Him. I was an
angel in heaven and disobeyed God. God sent me to
<BR>fetch a woman's soul. I flew to earth, and saw a sick woman lying alone,
who had just given birth to twin girls. They moved
<BR>feebly at their mother's side, but she could not lift them to her breast.
When she saw me, she understood that God had sent me
<BR>for her soul, and she wept and said: "Angel of God! My husband has
just been buried, killed by a falling tree. I have neither
<BR>sister, nor aunt, nor mother: no one to care for my orphans. Do not
take my soul! Let me nurse my babes, feed them, and set
<BR>them on their feet before I die. Children cannot live without father
or mother." And I hearkened to her. I placed one child at her
<BR>breast and gave the other into her arms, and returned to the Lord in
heaven. I flew to the Lord, and said: "I could not take the
<BR>soul of the mother. Her husband was killed by a tree; the woman has
twins, and prays that her soul may not be taken. She says:
<BR>'Let me nurse and feed my children, and set them on their feet. Children
cannot live without father or mother.' I have not taken
<BR>her soul." And God said: "Go -- take the mother's soul, and learn three
truths: Learn What dwells in man, What is not given
<BR>to man, and What men live by. When thou hast learnt these things, thou
shalt return to heaven." So I flew again to earth and
<BR>took the mother's soul. The babes dropped from her breasts. Her body
rolled over on the bed and crushed one babe, twisting
<BR>its leg. I rose above the village, wishing to take her soul to God;
but a wind seized me, and my wings drooped and dropped off.
<BR>Her soul rose alone to God, while I fell to earth by the roadside.'

<P>XI

<P>And Simon and Matry&oacute;na understood who it was that had lived with
them, and whom they had clothed and fed. And they wept
<BR>with awe and with joy. And the angel said: 'I was alone in the field,
naked. I had never known human needs, cold and hunger,
<BR>till I became a man. I was famished, frozen, and did not know what
to do. I saw, near the field I was in, a shrine built for God,
<BR>and I went to it hoping to find shelter. But the shrine was locked,
and I could not enter. So I sat down behind the shrine to
<BR>shelter myself at least from the wind. Evening drew on. I was hungry,
frozen, and in pain. Suddenly I heard a man coming along
<BR>the road. He carried a pair of boots, and was talking to himself. For
the first time since I became a man I saw the mortal face of
<BR>a man, and his face seemed terrible to me and I turned from it. And
I heard the man talking to himself of how to cover his body
<BR>from the cold in winter, and how to feed wife and children. And I thought:
"I am perishing of cold and hunger, and here is a man
<BR>thinking only of how to clothe himself and his wife, and how to get
bread for themselves. He cannot help me. When the man
<BR>saw me he frowned and became still more terrible, and passed me by
on the other side. I despaired, but suddenly I heard him
<BR>coming back. I looked up, and did not recognize the same man: before,
I had seen death in his face; but now he was alive, and
<BR>I recognized in him the presence of God. He came up to me, clothed
me, took me with him and brought me to his home. I
<BR>entered the house a woman came to meet us and began to speak. The woman
was still more terrible than the man had been;
<BR>the spirit of death came from her mouth; I could not breathe for the
stench of death that spread around her. She wished to drive
<BR>me out into the cold, and I knew that if she did so she would die.
Suddenly her husband spoke to her of God, and the woman
<BR>changed at once. And when she brought me food and looked at me, I glanced
at her and saw that death no longer dwelt in her;
<BR>she had become alive, and in her too I saw God.

<P>'Then I remembered the first lesson God had set me: "Learn what dwells
in man." And I understood that in man dwells Love!
<BR>I was glad that God had already begun to show me what He had promised,
and I smiled for the first time. But I had not yet
<BR>learnt all. I did not yet know What is not given to man, and What men
live by.

<P>'I lived with you, and a year passed. A man came to order boots that
should wear for a year without losing shape or cracking. I
<BR>looked at him, and suddenly, behind his shoulder, I saw my comrade
-- the angel of death. None but me saw that angel; but I
<BR>knew him, and knew that before the sun set he would take that rich
man's soul. And I thought to myself, "The man is making
<BR>preparations for a year, and does not know that he will die before
evening." And I remembered God's second saying, "Learn
<BR>what is not given to man."

<P>'What dwells in man I already knew. Now I learnt what is not given him.
It is not given to man to know his own needs. And I
<BR>smiled for the second time. I was glad to have seen my comrade angel
-- glad also that God had revealed to me the second
<BR>saying.

<P>'But I still did not know all. I did not know What men live by. And
I lived on, waiting till God should reveal to me the last
<BR>lesson. In the sixth year came the girl-twins with the woman; and I
recognized the girls, and heard how they had been kept
<BR>alive. Having heard the story, I thought, "Their mother besought me
for the children's sake, and I believed her when she said
<BR>that children cannot live without father or mother; but a stranger
has nursed them, and has brought them up." And when the
<BR>woman showed her love for the children that were not her own, and wept
over them, I saw in her the living God, and
<BR>understood What men live by. And I knew that God had revealed to me
the last lesson, and had forgiven my sin. And then I
<BR>smiled for the third time.'

<P>XII

<P>And the angel's body was bared, and he was clothed in light so that
eye could not look on him; and his voice grew louder, as
<BR>though it came not from him but from heaven above. And the angel said:

<P>'I have learnt that all men live not by care for themselves, but by
love.

<P>'It was not given to the mother to know what her children needed for
their life. Nor was it given to the rich man to know what
<BR>he himself needed. Nor is it given to any man to know whether, when
evening comes, he will need boots for his body or
<BR>slippers for his corpse.

<P>'I remained alive when I was a man, not by care of myself, but because
love was present in a passer-by, and because he and
<BR>his wife pitied and loved me. The orphans remained alive, not because
of their mother's care, but because there was love in the
<BR>heart of a woman a stranger to them, who pitied and loved them. And
all men live not by the thought they spend on their own
<BR>welfare, but because love exists in man.

<P>'I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should
live; now I understood more than that.

<P>'I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore
he does not reveal to them what each one needs for
<BR>himself; but he wishes them to live united, and therefore reveals to
each of them what is necessary for all.

<P>'I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by
care for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they
<BR>live. He who has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love.'

<P>And the angel sang praise to God, so that the hut trembled at his voice.
The roof opened, and a column of fire rose from earth
<BR>to heaven. Simon and his wife and children fell to the ground. Wings
appeared upon the angel's shoulders, and he rose into the
<BR>heavens.

<P>And when Simon came to himself the hut stood as before, and there was
no one in it but his own family.
