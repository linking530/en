<P>I

<P>AN officer named Zh&iacute;lin was serving in the army in the Caucasus.

<P>One day he received a letter from home. It was from his mother, who
wrote: 'I am getting old, and should like to see my dear
<BR>son once more before I die. Come and say good-bye to me and bury me,
and then, if God pleases, return to service again with
<BR>my blessing. But I have found a girl for you, who is sensible and good
and has some property. If you can love her, you might
<BR>marry her and remain at home.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin thought it over. It was quite true, the old lady was failing
fast and he might not have another chance to see her alive. He
<BR>had better go, and, if the girl was nice, why not marry her?

<P>So he went to his Colonel, obtained leave of absence, said good-bye
to his comrades, stood the soldiers four pailfuls of
<BR>v&oacute;dka[4] as a farewell treat, and got ready to go.

<P>It was a time of war in the Caucasus. The roads were not safe by night
or day. If ever a Russian ventured to ride or walk any
<BR>distance away from his fort, the Tartars killed him or carried him
off to the hills. So it had been arranged that twice every week
<BR>a body of soldiers should march from one fortress to the next to convoy
travellers from point to point.

<P>It was summer. At daybreak the baggage-train got ready under shelter
of the fortress; the soldiers marched out; and all started
<BR>along the road. Zh&iacute;lin was on horseback, and a cart with his
things went with the baggage-train. They had sixteen miles to go.
<BR>The baggage-train moved slowly; sometimes the soldiers stopped, or
perhaps a wheel would come off one of the carts, or a
<BR>horse refuse to go on, and then everybody had to wait.

<P>When by the sun it was already past noon, they had not gone half the
way. It was dusty and hot, the sun was scorching and
<BR>there was no shelter anywhere: a bare plain all round -- not a tree,
not a bush, by the road.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin rode on in front, and stopped, waiting for the baggage
to overtake him. Then he heard the signal-horn sounded behind
<BR>him: the company had again stopped. So he began to think: 'Hadn't I
better ride on by myself? My horse is a good one: if the
<BR>Tartars do attack me, I can gallop away. Perhaps, however, it would
be wiser to wait.'

<P>As he sat considering, Kost&iacute;lin, an officer carrying a gun, rode
up to him and said:

<P>'Come along, Zh&iacute;lin, let's go on by ourselves. It's dreadful;
I am famished, and the heat is terrible. My shirt is wringing wet.'

<P>Kost&iacute;lin was a stout, heavy man, and the perspiration was running
down his red face. Zh&iacute;lin thought awhile, and then asked: 'Is
<BR>your gun loaded?'

<P>'Yes it is.'

<P>'Well, then, let's go, but on condition that we keep together.'

<P>So they rode forward along the road across the plain, talking, but keeping
a look-out on both sides. They could see afar all
<BR>round. But after crossing the plain the road ran through a valley between
two hills, and Zh&iacute;lin said: 'We had better climb that hill
<BR>and have a look round, or the Tartars may be on us before we know it.'

<P>But Kost&iacute;lin answered: 'What's the use? Let us go on.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin, however, would not agree.

<P>'No,' he said; 'you can wait here if you like, but I'll go and look
round.' And he turned his horse to the left, up the hill. Zh&iacute;lin's
<BR>horse was a hunter, and carried him up the hillside as if it had wings.
(He had bought it for a hundred roubles as a colt out of a
<BR>herd, and had broken it in himself.) Hardly had he reached the top
of the hill, when he saw some thirty Tartars not much more
<BR>than a hundred yards ahead of him. As soon as he caught sight of them
he turned round but the Tartars had also seen him, and
<BR>rushed after him at full gallop, getting their guns out as they went.
Down galloped Zh&iacute;lin as fast as the horse's legs could go,
<BR>shouting to Kost&iacute;lin: 'Get your gun ready!'

<P>And, in thought, he said to his horse: 'Get me well out of this, my
pet; don't stumble, for if you do it's all up. Once I reach the
<BR>gun, they shan't take me prisoner.'

<P>But, instead of waiting, Kost&iacute;lin, as soon as he caught sight
of the Tartars, turned back towards the fortress at full speed,
<BR>whipping his horse now on one side now on the other, and its switching
tail was all that could be seen of him in the dust.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin saw it was a bad look-out; the gun was gone, and what
could he do with nothing but his sword? He turned his horse
<BR>towards the escort, thinking to escape, but there were six Tartars
rushing to cut him off. His horse was a good one, but theirs
<BR>were still better; and besides, they were across his path. He tried
to rein in his horse and to turn another way, but it was going
<BR>so fast it could not stop, and dashed on straight towards the Tartars.
He saw a red-bearded Tartar on a grey horse, with his
<BR>gun raised, come at him, yelling and showing his teeth.

<P>'Ah,' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'I know you, devils that you are. If you
take me alive, you'll put me in a pit and flog me. I will not be taken
<BR>alive!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin, though not a big fellow, was brave. He drew his sword
and dashed at the red-bearded Tartar thinking: 'Either I'll ride
<BR>him down, or disable him with my sword.'

<P>He was still a horse's length away from him, when he was fired at from
behind, and his horse was hit. It fell to the ground with
<BR>all its weight, pinning Zh&iacute;lin to the earth.

<P>He tried to rise, but two ill-savoured Tartars were already sitting
on him and binding his hands behind his back. He made an
<BR>effort and flung them off, but three others jumped from their horses
and began beating his head with the butts of their guns. His
<BR>eyes grew dim, and he fell back. The Tartars seized him, and, taking
spare girths from their saddles, twisted his hands behind
<BR>him and tied them with a Tartar knot. They knocked his cap off, pulled
off his boots, searched him all over, tore his clothes, and
<BR>took his money and his watch.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin looked round at his horse. There it lay on its side, poor
thing, just as it had fallen; struggling, its legs in the air, unable to
<BR>touch the ground. There was a hole in its head, and black blood was
pouring out, turning the dust to mud for a couple of feet
<BR>around.

<P>One of the Tartars went up to the horse and began taking the saddle
off, it still kicked, so he drew a dagger and cut its
<BR>windpipe. A whistling sound came from its throat, the horse gave one
plunge, and all was over.

<P>The Tartars took the saddle and trappings. The red-bearded Tartar mounted
his horse, and the others lifted Zh&iacute;lin into the
<BR>saddle behind him. To prevent his falling off, they strapped him to
the Tartar's girdle; and then they all rode away to the hills.

<P>So there sat Zh&iacute;lin, swaying from side to side, his head striking
against the Tartar's stinking back. He could see nothing but that
<BR>muscular back and sinewy neck, with its closely shaven, bluish nape.
Zh&iacute;lin's head was wounded: the blood had dried over his
<BR>eyes, and he could neither shift his position on the saddle nor wipe
the blood off. His arms were bound so tightly that his
<BR>collar-bones ached.

<P>They rode up and down hills for a long way. Then they reached a river
which they forded, and came to a hard road leading
<BR>across a valley.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to see where they were going, but his eyelids were
stuck together with blood, and he could not turn.

<P>Twilight began to fall; they crossed another river and rode up a stony
hillside. There was a smell of smoke here, and dogs were
<BR>barking. They had reached an Aoul (a Tartar village). The Tartars got
off their horses; Tartar children came and stood round
<BR>Zh&iacute;lin, shrieking with pleasure and throwing stones at him.

<P>The Tartar drove the children away, took Zh&iacute;lin off the horse,
and called his man. A Nog&aacute;y[5] with high cheek-bones, and
<BR>nothing on but a shirt (and that so torn that his breast was all bare),
answered the call. The Tartar gave him an order. He went
<BR>and fetched shackles: two blocks of oak with iron rings attached, and
a clasp and lock fixed to one of the rings.

<P>They untied Zh&iacute;lin's arms, fastened the shackles on his leg,
and dragged him to a barn, where they pushed him in and locked the
<BR>door.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin fell on a heap of manure. He lay still awhile then groped
about to find a soft place, and settled down.

<P>II

<P>That night Zh&iacute;lin hardly slept at all. It was the time of year
when the nights are short, and daylight soon showed itself through a
<BR>chink in the wall. He rose, scratched to make the chink bigger, and
peeped out.

<P>Through the hole he saw a road leading down-hill; to the right was a
Tartar hut with two trees near it, a black dog lay on the
<BR>threshold, and a goat and kids were moving about wagging their tails.
Then he saw a young Tartar woman in a long, loose,
<BR>bright-coloured gown, with trousers and high boots showing from under
it. She had a coat thrown over her head, on which she
<BR>carried a large metal jug filled with water. She was leading by the
hand a small, closely-shaven Tartar boy, who wore nothing
<BR>but a shirt; and as she went along balancing herself, the muscles of
her back quivered. This woman carried the water into the
<BR>hut, and, soon after, the red-bearded Tartar of yesterday came out
dressed in a silk tunic, with a silver-hilted dagger hanging by
<BR>his side, shoes on his bare feet, and a tall black sheepskin cap set
far back on his head. He came out, stretched himself, and
<BR>stroked his red beard. He stood awhile, gave an order to his servant,
and went away.

<P>Then two lads rode past from watering their horses. The horses' noses
were wet. Some other closely-shaven boys ran out,
<BR>without any trousers, and wearing nothing but their shirts. They crowded
together, came to the barn, picked up a twig, and
<BR>began pushing it in at the chink. Zh&iacute;lin gave a shout, and the
boys shrieked and scampered off, their little bare knees gleaming as
<BR>they ran.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin was very thirsty: his throat was parched, and he thought:
'If only they would come and so much as look at me!'

<P>Then he heard some one unlocking the barn. The red-bearded Tartar entered,
and with him was another a smaller man, dark,
<BR>with bright black eyes, red cheeks and a short beard. He had a merry
face, and was always laughing. This man was even more
<BR>richly dressed than the other. He wore a blue silk tunic trimmed with
gold, a large silver dagger in his belt, red morocco slippers
<BR>worked with silver, and over these a pair of thick shoes, and he had
a white sheepskin cap on his head.

<P>The red-bearded Tartar entered, muttered something as if he were annoyed,
and stood leaning against the doorpost, playing
<BR>with his dagger, and glaring askance at Zh&iacute;lin, like a wolf.
The dark one, quick and lively and moving as if on springs, came
<BR>straight up to Zh&iacute;lin, squatted down in front of him, slapped
him on the shoulder, and began to talk very fast in his own
<BR>language. His teeth showed, and he kept winking, clicking his tongue,
and repeating, 'Good Russ, good Russ.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin could not understand a word, but said, 'Drink! give me
water to drink!'

<P>The dark man only laughed. 'Good Russ,' he said, and went on talking
in his own tongue.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin made signs with lips and hands that he wanted something
to drink.

<P>The dark man understood, and laughed. Then he looked out of the door,
and called to some one: 'Dina!'

<P>A little girl came running in: she was about thirteen, slight, thin,
and like the dark Tartar in face. Evidently she was his daughter.
<BR>She, too, had clear black eyes, and her face was good-looking. She
had on a long blue gown with wide sleeves, and no girdle.
<BR>The hem of her gown, the front, and the sleeves, were trimmed with
red. She wore trousers and slippers, and over the slippers
<BR>stouter shoes with high heels. Round her neck she had a necklace made
of Russian silver coins. She was bareheaded, and her
<BR>black hair was plaited with a ribbon and ornamented with gilt braid
and silver coins.

<P>Her father gave an order, and she ran away and returned with a metal
jug. She handed the water to Zh&iacute;lin and sat down,
<BR>crouching so that her knees were as high as her head, and there she
sat with wide open eyes watching Zh&iacute;lin drink, as though he
<BR>were a wild animal.

<P>When Zh&iacute;lin handed the empty jug back to her, she gave such a
sudden jump back, like a wild goat, that it made her father
<BR>laugh. He sent her away for something else. She took the jug, ran out,
and brought back some unleavened bread on a round
<BR>board, and once more sat down, crouching, and looking on with staring
eves.

<P>Then the Tartars went away and again locked the door.

<P>After a while the Nog&aacute;y came and said: 'Ayda, the master, Ayda!'

<P>He, too, knew no Russian. All Zh&iacute;lin could make out was that
he was told to go somewhere.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin followed the N&oacute;gay, but limped, for the shackles
dragged his feet so that he could hardly step at all. On getting out of
the
<BR>barn he saw a Tartar village of about ten houses, and a Tartar church
with a small tower. Three horses stood saddled before
<BR>one of the houses; little boys were holding them by the reins. The
dark Tartar came out of this house, beckoning with his hand
<BR>for Zh&iacute;lin to follow him. Then he laughed, said something in
his own language, and returned into the house.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin entered. The room was a good one: the walls smoothly plastered
with clay. Near the front wall lay a pile of
<BR>bright-coloured feather beds; the side walls were covered with rich
carpets used as hangings, and on these were fastened guns,
<BR>pistols and swords, all inlaid with silver. Close to one of the walls
was a small stove on a level with the earthen floor. The floor
<BR>itself was as clean as a thrashing-ground. A large space in one corner
was spread over with felt, on which were rugs, and on
<BR>these rugs were cushions stuffed with down. And on these cushions sat
five Tartars, the dark one, the red-haired one, and three
<BR>guests. They were wearing their indoor slippers, and each had a cushion
behind his back. Before them were standing millet
<BR>cakes on a round board, melted butter in a bowl and a jug of buza,
or Tartar beer. They ate both cakes and butter with their
<BR>hands.

<P>The dark man jumped up and ordered Zh&iacute;lin to be placed on one
side, not on the carpet but on the bare ground, then he sat
<BR>down on the carpet again, and offered millet cakes and buza to his
guests. The servant made Zh&iacute;lin sit down, after which he
<BR>took off his own overshoes, put them by the door where the other shoes
were standing, and sat down nearer to his masters on
<BR>the felt, watching them as they ate, and licking his lips.

<P>The Tartars ate as much as they wanted, and a woman dressed in the same
way as the girl -- in a long gown and trousers, with
<BR>a kerchief on her head -- came and took away what was left, and brought
a handsome basin, and an ewer with a narrow spout.
<BR>The Tartars washed their hands, folded them, went down on their knees,
blew to the four quarters, and said their prayers. After
<BR>they had talked for a while, one of the guests turned to Zh&iacute;lin
and began to speak in Russian.

<P>'You were captured by Kazi-Mohammed,' he said, and pointed at the red-bearded
Tartar. 'And Kazi-Mohammed has given
<BR>you to Abdul Murat,' pointing at the dark one. 'Abdul Murat is now
your master.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin was silent. Then Abdul Murat began to talk, laughing,
pointing to Zh&iacute;lin, and repeating, 'Soldier Russ, good Russ.'

<P>The interpreter said, 'He orders you to write home and tell them to
send a ransom, and as soon as the money comes he will set
<BR>you free.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin thought for a moment, and said, 'How much ransom does
he want?'

<P>The Tartars talked awhile, and then the interpreter said, 'Three thousand
roubles.'

<P>'No,' said Zh&iacute;lin,' I can't pay so much.'

<P>Abdul jumped up and, waving his arms, talked to Zh&iacute;lin' thinking,
as before, that he would understand. The interpreter
<BR>translated: 'How much will you give?'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin considered, and said, 'Five hundred roubles.' At this
the Tartars began speaking very quickly, all together. Abdul began
<BR>to shout at the red-bearded one, and jabbered so fast that the spittle
spurted out of his mouth. The red-bearded one only
<BR>screwed up his eyes and clicked his tongue.

<P>They quietened down after a while, and the interpreter said, 'Five hundred
roubles is not enough for the master. He paid two
<BR>hundred for you himself. Kazi-Mohammed was in debt to him, and he took
you in payment. Three thousand roubles! Less than
<BR>that won't do. If you refuse to write, you will be put into a pit and
flogged with a whip!'

<P>'Eh!' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'the more one fears them the worse it will
be.'

<P>So he sprang to his feet, and said, 'You tell that dog that if he tries
to frighten me I will not write at all, and he will get nothing. I
<BR>never was afraid of you dogs, and never will be!'

<P>The interpreter translated, and again they all began to talk at once.

<P>They jabbered for a long time, and then the dark man jumped up, came
to Zh&iacute;lin, and said: 'Dzhigit Russ, dzhigit Russ!'
<BR>(Dzhigit in their language means 'brave.') And he laughed, and said
something to the interpreter, who translated: 'One thousand
<BR>roubles will satisfy him.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin stuck to it: 'I will not give more than five hundred.
And if you kill me you'll get nothing at all.'

<P>The Tartars talked awhile, then sent the servant out to fetch something,
and kept looking, now at Zh&iacute;lin, now at the door. The
<BR>servant returned, followed by a stout, bare-footed, tattered man, who
also had his leg shackled.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin gasped with surprise: it was Kost&iacute;lin. He, too,
had been taken. They were put side by side, and began to tell each other
<BR>what had occurred. While they talked, the Tartars looked on in silence.
Zh&iacute;lin related what had happened to him; and Kost&iacute;lin
<BR>told how his horse had stopped, his gun missed fire, and this same
Abdul had overtaken and captured him.

<P>Abdul jumped up, pointed to Kost&iacute;lin, and said something. The
interpreter translated that they both now belonged to one
<BR>master, and the one who first paid the ransom would be set free first.

<P>'There now,' he said to Zh&iacute;lin, 'you get angry, but your comrade
here is gentle; he has written home, and they will send five
<BR>thousand roubles. So he will be well fed and well treated.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin replied: 'My comrade can do as he likes; maybe he is rich,
I am not. It must be as I said. Kill me, if you like -- you will
<BR>gain nothing by it; but I will not write for more than five hundred
roubles.'

<P>They were silent. Suddenly up sprang Abdul, brought a little box, took
out a pen, ink, and a bit of paper, gave them to Zh&iacute;lin,
<BR>slapped him on the shoulder, and made a sign that he should write.
He had agreed to take five hundred roubles.

<P>'Wait a bit!' said Zh&iacute;lin to the interpreter; 'tell him that
he must feed us properly, give us proper clothes and boots, and let us
be
<BR>together. It will be more cheerful for us. And he must have these shackles
taken off our feet,' and Zh&iacute;lin looked at his master
<BR>and laughed.

<P>The master also laughed, heard the interpreter, and said: 'I will give
them the best of clothes: a cloak and boots fit to be married
<BR>in. I will feed them like princes; and if they like they can live together
in the barn. But I can't take off the shackles, or they will
<BR>run away. They shall be taken off, however, at night.' And he jumped
up and slapped Zh&iacute;lin on the shoulder, exclaiming: 'You
<BR>good, I good!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin wrote the letter, but addressed it wrongly, so that it
should not reach its destination, thinking to himself: 'I'll run away!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin and Kost&iacute;lin were taken back to the barn and given
some maize straw, a jug of water, some bread, two old cloaks, and
<BR>some worn-out military boots -- evidently taken from the corpses of
Russian soldiers, At night their shackles were taken off
<BR>their feet, and they were locked up in the barn.

<P>III

<P>Zh&iacute;lin and his friend lived in this way for a whole month. The
master always laughed and said: 'You, Iv&aacute;n, good! I, Abdul,
<BR>good!' But he fed them badly giving them nothing but unleavened bread
of millet-flour baked into flat cakes, or sometimes only
<BR>unbaked dough.

<P>Kost&iacute;lin wrote home a second time, and did nothing but mope and
wait for the money to arrive. He would sit for days together
<BR>in the barn sleeping, or counting the days till a letter could come.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin knew his letter would reach no one, and he did not write
another. He thought: 'Where could my mother get enough
<BR>money to ransom me? As it is she lived chiefly on what I sent her.
If she had to raise five hundred roubles, she would be quite
<BR>ruined. With God's help I'll manage to escape!'

<P>So he kept on the look-out, planning how to run away.

<P>He would walk about the Aoul whistling; or would sit working, modelling
dolls of clay, or weaving baskets out of twigs: for
<BR>Zh&iacute;lin was clever with his hands.

<P>Once he modelled a doll with a nose and hands and feet and with a Tartar
gown on, and put it up on the roof. When the Tartar
<BR>women came out to fetch water, the master's daughter, Dina, saw the
doll and called the women, who put down their jugs and
<BR>stood looking and laughing. Zh&iacute;lin took down the doll and held
it out to them. They laughed, but dared not take it. He put down
<BR>the doll and went into the barn, waiting to see what would happen.

<P>Dina ran up to the doll, looked round, seized it, and ran away.

<P>In the morning, at daybreak, he looked out. Dina came out of the house
and sat down on the threshold with the doll, which she
<BR>had dressed up in bits of red stuff, and she rocked it like a baby,
singing a Tartar lullaby. An old woman came out and scolded
<BR>her, and snatching the doll away she broke it to bits, and sent Dina
about her business.

<P>But Zh&iacute;lin made another doll, better than the first, and gave
it to Dina. Once Dina brought a little jug, put it on the ground, sat
<BR>down gazing at him, and laughed, pointing to the jug.

<P>'What pleases her so?' wondered Zh&iacute;lin. He took the jug thinking
it was water, but it turned out to be milk. He drank the milk
<BR>and said: 'That's good!'

<P>How pleased Dina was! 'Good, Iv&aacute;n, good!' said she, and she jumped
up and clapped her hands. Then, seizing the jug, she ran
<BR>away. After that, she stealthily brought him some milk every day.

<P>The Tartars make a kind of cheese out of goat's milk, which they dry
on the roofs of their houses; and sometimes, on the sly,
<BR>she brought him some of this cheese. And once, when Abdul had killed
a sheep she brought Zh&iacute;lin a bit of mutton in her sleeve.
<BR>She would just throw the things down and run away.

<P>One day there was a heavy storm, and the rain fell in torrents for a
whole hour. All the streams became turbid. At the ford, the
<BR>water rose till it was seven feet high, and the current was so strong
that it rolled the stones about. Rivulets flowed everywhere,
<BR>and the rumbling in the hills never ceased. When the storm was over,
the water ran in streams down the village street. Zh&iacute;lin got
<BR>his master to lend him a knife, and with it he shaped a small cylinder,
and cutting some little boards, he made a wheel to which
<BR>he fixed two dolls, one on each side. The little girls brought him
some bits of stuff, and he dressed the dolls, one as a peasant,
<BR>the other as a peasant woman. Then he fastened them in their places,
and set the wheel so that the stream should work it. The
<BR>wheel began to turn and the dolls danced.

<P>The whole village collected round. Little boys and girls, Tartar men
and women, all came and clicked their tongues.

<P>'Ah, Russ! Ah, Iv&aacute;n!'

<P>Abdul had a Russian clock, which was broken. He called Zh&iacute;lin
and showed it to him, clicking his tongue.

<P>'Give it me, I'll mend it for you,' said Zh&iacute;lin.

<P>He took it to pieces with the knife, sorted the pieces, and put them
together again, so that the clock went all right.

<P>The master was delighted, and made him a present of one of his old tunics
which was all in holes. Zh&iacute;lin had to accept it. He
<BR>could, at any rate, use it as a coverlet at night.

<P>After that Zh&iacute;lin's fame spread; and Tartars came from distant
villages, bringing him now the lock of a gun or of a pistol, now a
<BR>watch, to mend. His master gave him some tools -- pincers, gimlets,
and a file.

<P>One day a Tartar fell ill, and they came to Zh&iacute;lin saying, 'Come
and heal him!' Zh&iacute;lin knew nothing about doctoring, but he went
<BR>to look, and thought to himself, 'Perhaps he will get well anyway.'

<P>He returned to the barn, mixed some water with sand, and then in the
presence of the Tartars whispered some words over it
<BR>and gave it to the sick man to drink. Luckily for him, the Tartar recovered.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin began to pick up their language a little, and some of
the Tartars grew familiar with him. When they wanted him, they
<BR>would call: 'Iv&aacute;n! Iv&aacute;n!' Others, however, still looked
at him askance, as at a wild beast.

<P>The red-bearded Tartar disliked Zh&iacute;lin. Whenever he saw him he
frowned and turned away, or swore at him. There was also
<BR>an old man there who did not live in the Aoul, but used to come up
from the foot of the hill. Zh&iacute;lin only saw him when he passed
<BR>on his way to the Mosque. He was short, and had a white cloth wound
round his hat. His beard and moustaches were clipped,
<BR>and white as snow; and his face was wrinkled and brick-red. His nose
was hooked like a hawk's, his grey eyes looked cruel,
<BR>and he had no teeth except two tusks. He would pass, with his turban
on his head, leaning on his staff, and glaring round him
<BR>like a wolf. If he saw Zh&iacute;lin he would snort with anger and
turn away.

<P>Once Zh&iacute;lin descended the hill to see where the old man lived.
He went down along the pathway and came to a little garden
<BR>surrounded by a stone wall; and behind the wall he saw cherry and apricot
trees, and a hut with a flat roof. He came closer,
<BR>and saw hives made of plaited straw, and bees flying about and humming.
The old man was kneeling, busy doing something
<BR>with a hive. Zh&iacute;lin stretched to look, and his shackles rattled.
The old man turned round, and, giving a yell, snatched a pistol
<BR>from his belt and shot at Zh&iacute;lin, who just managed to shelter
himself behind the stone wall.

<P>The old man went to Zh&iacute;lin's master to complain. The master called
Zh&iacute;lin, and said with a laugh, 'Why did you go to the old
<BR>man's house?'

<P>'I did him no harm,' replied Zh&iacute;lin. 'I only wanted to see how
he lived.'

<P>The master repeated what Zh&iacute;lin said.

<P>But the old man was in a rage; he hissed and jabbered, showing his tusks,
and shaking his fists at Zh&iacute;lin.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin could not understand all, but he gathered that the old
man was telling Abdul he ought not to keep Russians in the Aoul,
<BR>but ought to kill them. At last the old man went away.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin asked the master who the old man was.

<P>'He is a great man!' said the master. 'He was the bravest of our fellows;
he killed many Russians and was at one time very rich.
<BR>He had three wives and eight sons, and they all lived in one village.
Then the Russians came and destroyed the village, and
<BR>killed seven of his sons. Only one son was left, and he gave himself
up to the Russians. The old man also went and gave himself
<BR>up, and lived among the Russians for three months. At the end of that
time he found his son, killed him with his own hands, and
<BR>then escaped. After that he left off fighting, and went to Mecca to
pray to God; that is why he wears a turban. One who has
<BR>been to Mecca is called "Hadji," and wears a turban. He does not like
you fellows. He tells me to kill you. But I can't kill you. I
<BR>have paid money for you and, besides, I have grown fond of you, Iv&aacute;n.
Far from killing you, I would not even let you go if I
<BR>had not promised.' And he laughed, saying in Russian, 'You, Iv&aacute;n,
good; I, Abdul, good!'

<P>IV

<P>Zh&iacute;lin lived in this way for a month. During the day he sauntered
about the Aoul or busied himself with some handicraft, but at
<BR>night, when all was silent in the Aoul, he dug at the floor of the
barn. It was no easy task digging, because of the stones; but he
<BR>worked away at them with his file, and at last had made a hole under
the wall large enough to get through.

<P>'If only I could get to know the lay of the land,' thought he, 'and
which way to go! But none of the Tartars will tell me.'

<P>So he chose a day when the master was away from home, and set off after
dinner to climb the hill beyond the village, and to
<BR>look around. But before leaving home the master always gave orders
to his son to watch Zh&iacute;lin, and not to lose sight of him. So
<BR>the lad ran after Zh&iacute;lin, shouting: 'Don't go! Father does not
allow it. I'll call the neighbours if you won't come back.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to persuade him, and said: 'I'm not going far; I
only want to climb that hill. I want to find a herb -- to cure sick
<BR>people with. You come with me if you like. How can I run away with
these shackles on? To-morrow I'll make a bow and
<BR>arrows for you.'

<P>So he persuaded the lad, and they went. To look at the hill, it did
not seem far to the top; but it was hard walking with shackles
<BR>on his leg. Zh&iacute;lin went on and on, but it was all he could do
to reach the top. There he sat down and noted how the land lay. To
<BR>the south, beyond the barn, was a valley in which a herd of horses
was pasturing and at the bottom of the valley one could see
<BR>another Aoul. Beyond that was a still steeper hill, and another hill
beyond that. Between the hills, in the blue distance, were
<BR>forests, and still further off were mountains, rising higher and higher.
The highest of them were covered with snow, white as
<BR>sugar; and one snowy peak towered above all the rest. To the east and
to the west were other such hills, and here and there
<BR>smoke rose from Aouls in the ravines. 'Ah,' thought he, 'all that is
Tartar country.' And he turned towards the Russian side. At
<BR>his feet he saw a river, and the Aoul he lived in, surrounded by little
gardens. He could see women, like tiny dolls, sitting by the
<BR>river rinsing clothes. Beyond the Aoul was a hill, lower than the one
to the south, and beyond it two other hills well wooded;
<BR>and between these, a smooth bluish plain, and far, far across the plain
something that looked like a cloud of smoke. Zh&iacute;lin tried
<BR>to remember where the sun used to rise and set when he was living in
the fort, and he saw that there was no mistake: the
<BR>Russian fort must be in that plain. Between those two hills he would
have to make his way when he escaped.

<P>The sun was beginning to set. The white, snowy mountains turned red,
and the dark hills turned darker; mists rose from the
<BR>ravine, and the valley, where he supposed the Russian fort to be, seemed
on fire with the sunset glow. Zh&iacute;lin looked carefully.
<BR>Something seemed to be quivering in the valley like smoke from a chimney,
and he felt sure the Russian fortress was there.

<P>It had grown late. The Mullah's cry was heard. The herds were being
driven home, the cows were lowing, and the lad kept
<BR>saying, 'Come home!' But Zh&iacute;lin did not feel inclined to go
away.

<P>At last, however, they went back. 'Well,' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'now
that I know the way, it is time to escape.' He thought of running
<BR>away that night. The nights were dark -- the moon had waned. But as
ill-luck would have it, the Tartars returned home that
<BR>evening. They generally came back driving cattle before them and in
good spirits. But this time they had no cattle. All they
<BR>brought home was the dead body of a Tartar -- the red one's brother
-- who had been killed. They came back looking sullen,
<BR>and they all gathered together for the burial. Zh&iacute;lin also came
out to see it.

<P>They wrapped the body in a piece of linen, without any coffin, and carried
it out of the village, and laid it on the grass under
<BR>some plane-trees. The Mullah and the old men came. They wound clothes
round their caps, took off their shoes, and squatted
<BR>on their heels, side by side, near the corpse.

<P>The Mullah was in front: behind him in a row were three old men in turbans,
and behind them again the other Tartars. All cast
<BR>down their eyes and sat in silence. This continued a long time, until
the Mullah raised his head and said: 'Allah!' (which means
<BR>God). He said that one word, and they all cast down their eyes again,
and were again silent for a long time. They sat quite still,
<BR>not moving or making any sound.

<P>Again the Mullah lifted his head and said, 'Allah!' and they all repeated:
'Allah! Allah!' and were again silent.

<P>The dead body lay immovable on the grass, and they sat as still as if
they too were dead. Not one of them moved. There was
<BR>no sound but that of the leaves of the plane-trees stirring in the
breeze. Then the Mullah repeated a prayer, and they all rose.
<BR>They lifted the body and carried it in their arms to a hole in the
ground. It was not an ordinary hole, but was hollowed out under
<BR>the ground like a vault. They took the body under the arms and by the
legs, bent it, and let it gently down, pushing it under the
<BR>earth in a sitting posture, with the hands folded in front.

<P>The Nog&aacute;y brought some green rushes, which they stuffed into
the hole, and, quickly covering it with earth, they smoothed the
<BR>ground, and set an upright stone at the head of the grave. Then they
trod the earth down, and again sat in a row before the
<BR>grave, keeping silence for a long time.

<P>At last they rose, said 'Allah! Allah! Allah!' and sighed.

<P>The red-bearded Tartar gave money to the old men; then he too rose,
took a whip, struck himself with it three times on the
<BR>forehead, and went home.

<P>The next morning Zh&iacute;lin saw the red Tartar, followed by three
others, leading a mare out of the village. When they were beyond
<BR>the village, the red-bearded Tartar took off his tunic and turned up
his sleeves, showing his stout arms. Then he drew a dagger
<BR>and sharpened it on a whetstone. The other Tartars raised the mare's
head, and he cut her throat, threw her down and began
<BR>skinning her, loosening the hide with his big hands. Women and girls
came and began to wash the entrails and the inwards. The
<BR>mare was cut up, the pieces taken into the hut, and the whole village
collected at the red Tartar's hut for a funeral feast.

<P>For three days they went on eating the flesh of the mare, drinking buza,
and praying for the dead man. All the Tartars were at
<BR>home. On the fourth day at dinner-time Zh&iacute;lin saw them preparing
to go away. Horses were brought out, they got ready, and
<BR>some ten of them (the red one among them) rode away; but Abdul stayed
at home. It was new moon, and the nights were still
<BR>dark.

<P>'Ah!' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'to-night is the time to escape.' And he
told Kost&iacute;lin; but Kost&iacute;lin's heart failed him.

<P>'How can we escape?' he said. 'We don't even know the way.'

<P>'I know the way,' said Zh&iacute;lin.

<P>'Even if you do'' said Kost&iacute;lin, 'we can't reach the fort in
one night.'

<P>'If we can't,' said Zh&iacute;lin, 'we'll sleep in the forest. See here,
I have saved some cheeses. What's the good of sitting and moping
<BR>here? If they send your ransom -- well and good; but suppose they don't
manage to collect it? The Tartars are angry now,
<BR>because the Russians have killed one of their men. They are talking
of killing us.'

<P>Kost&iacute;lin thought it over.

<P>'Well, let's go,' said he.

<P>V

<P>Zh&iacute;lin crept into the hole, widened it so that Kost&iacute;lin
might also get through, and then they both sat waiting till all should
be quiet
<BR>in the Aoul.

<P>As soon as all was quiet, Zh&iacute;lin crept under the wall, got out,
and whispered to Kost&iacute;lin, 'Come!' Kost&iacute;lin crept out, but
in so
<BR>doing he caught a stone with his foot and made a noise. The master
had a very vicious watch-dog, a spotted one called
<BR>Oulyashin. Zh&iacute;lin had been careful to feed him for some time
before. Oulyashin heard the noise and began to bark and jump,
<BR>and the other dogs did the same. Zh&iacute;lin gave a slight whistle,
and threw him a bit of cheese. Oulyashin knew Zh&iacute;lin, wagged his
<BR>tail, and stopped barking.

<P>But the master had heard the dog, and shouted to him from his hut, 'Hayt,
hayt, Oulyashin!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin, however, scratched Oulyashin behind the ears, and the
dog was quiet, and rubbed against his legs, wagging his tail

<P>They sat hidden behind a corner for awhile. All became silent again,
only a sheep coughed inside a shed, and the water rippled
<BR>over the stones in the hollow. It was dark, the stars were high overhead,
and the new moon showed red as it set, horns
<BR>upward, behind the hill. In the valleys the fog was white as milk.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin rose and said to his companion, 'Well, friend, come along!'

<P>They started; but they had only gone a few steps when they heard the
Mullah crying from the roof, 'Allah, Beshmillah!
<BR>Ilrahman!' That meant that the people would be going to the Mosque.
So they sat down again, hiding behind a wall, and waited
<BR>a long time till the people had passed. At last all was quiet again.

<P>'Now then! May God be with us!' They crossed themselves, and started
once more. They passed through a yard and went
<BR>down the hillside to the river, crossed the river, and went along the
valley.

<P>The mist was thick, but only near the ground; overhead the stars shone
quite brightly. Zh&iacute;lin directed their course by the stars. It
<BR>was cool in the mist, and easy walking, only their boots were uncomfortable,
being worn out and trodden down. Zh&iacute;lin took his
<BR>off, threw them away, and went barefoot, jumping from stone to stone,
and guiding his course by the stars. Kost&iacute;lin began to lag
<BR>behind.

<P>'Walk slower,' he said, 'these confounded boots have quite blistered
my feet.'

<P>'Take them off!' said Zh&iacute;lin. 'It will be easier walking without
them.'

<P>Kost&iacute;lin went barefoot, but got on still worse. The stones cut
his feet and he kept lagging behind. Zh&iacute;lin said: 'If your feet
get cut,
<BR>they'll heal again; but if the Tartars catch us and kill us, it will
be worse!'

<P>Kost&iacute;lin did not reply, but went on, groaning all the time.

<P>Their way lay through the valley for a long time. Then, to the right,
they heard dogs barking. Zh&iacute;lin stopped, looked about, and
<BR>began climbing the hill feeling with his hands.

<P>'Ah!' said he, 'we have gone wrong, and have come too far to the right.
Here is another Aoul, one I saw from the hill. We must
<BR>turn back and go up that hill to the left. There must be a wood there.'

<P>But Kost&iacute;lin said: 'Wait a minute! Let me get breath. My feet
are all cut and bleeding.'

<P>'Never mind, friend! They'll heal again. You should spring more lightly.
Like this!'

<P>And Zh&iacute;lin ran back and turned to the left up the hill towards
the wood.

<P>Kost&iacute;lin still lagged behind, and groaned. Zh&iacute;lin only
said 'Hush!' and went on and on.

<P>They went up the hill and found a wood as Zh&iacute;lin had said. They
entered the wood and forced their way through the brambles,
<BR>which tore their clothes. At last they came to a path and followed
it.

<P>'Stop!' They heard the tramp of hoofs on the path, and waited, listening.
It sounded like the tramping of a horse's feet, but then
<BR>ceased. They moved on, and again they heard the tramping. When they
paused, it also stopped. Zh&iacute;lin crept nearer to it, and
<BR>saw something standing on the path where it was not quite so dark.
It looked like a horse, and yet not quite like one, and on it
<BR>was something queer, not like a man. He heard it snorting. 'What can
it be?' Zh&iacute;lin gave a low whistle, and off it dashed from
<BR>the path into the thicket, and the woods were filled with the noise
of crackling, as if a hurricane were sweeping through,
<BR>breaking the branches.

<P>Kost&iacute;lin was so frightened that he sank to the ground. But Zh&iacute;lin
laughed and said: 'It's a stag. Don't you hear him breaking the
<BR>branches with his antlers? We were afraid of him, and he is afraid
of us.'

<P>They went on. The Great Bear was already setting. It was near morning,
and they did not know whether they were going the
<BR>right way or not. Zh&iacute;lin thought it was the way he had been
brought by the Tartars, and that they were still some seven miles
<BR>from the Russian fort; but he had nothing certain to go by, and at
night one easily mistakes the way. After a time they came to a
<BR>clearing. Kost&iacute;lin sat down and said: 'Do as you like, I can
go no farther! My feet won't carry me.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to persuade him.

<P>'No I shall never get there, I can't!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin grew angry, and spoke roughly to him.

<P>'Well, then, I shall go on alone. Good-bye!'

<P>Kost&iacute;lin jumped up and followed. They went another three miles.
The mist in the wood had settled down still more densely;
<BR>they could not see a yard before them, and the stars had grown dim.

<P>Suddenly they heard the sound of a horse's hoofs in front of them. They
heard its shoes strike the stones. Zh&iacute;lin lay down flat,
<BR>and listened with his ear to the ground.

<P>'Yes, so it is! A horseman is coming towards us.'

<P>They ran off the path, crouched among the bushes and waited. Zh&iacute;lin
crept to the road, looked, and saw a Tartar on horseback
<BR>driving a cow and humming to himself. The Tartar rode past. Zh&iacute;lin
returned to Kost&iacute;lin.

<P>'God has led him past us; get up and let's go on!'

<P>Kost&iacute;lin tried to rise, but fell back again.

<P>'I can't; on my word I can't! I have no strength left.'

<P>He was heavy and stout, and had been perspiring freely. Chilled by the
mist, and with his feet all bleeding, he had grown quite
<BR>limp.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to lift him, when suddenly Kost&iacute;lin screamed
out: 'Oh, how it hurts!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin's heart sank.

<P>'What are you shouting for? The Tartar is still near; he'll have heard
you!' And he thought to himself, 'He is really quite done up.
<BR>What am I to do with him? It won't do to desert a comrade.'

<P>'Well, then, get up, and climb up on my back. I'll carry you if you
really can't walk.'

<P>He helped Kost&iacute;lin up, and put his arms under his thighs. Then
he went out on to the path, carrying him.

<P>'Only, for the love of heaven,' said Zh&iacute;lin, 'don't throttle
me with your hands! Hold on to my shoulders.'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin found his load heavy; his feet, too, were bleeding, and
he was tired out. Now and then he stooped to balance Kost&iacute;lin
<BR>better, jerking him up so that he should sit higher, and then went
on again.

<P>The Tartar must, however, really have heard Kost&iacute;lin scream.
Zh&iacute;lin suddenly heard some one galloping behind and shouting in
<BR>the Tartar tongue. He darted in among the bushes. The Tartar seized
his gun and fired, but did not hit them, shouted in his own
<BR>language, and galloped off along the road.

<P>'Well, now we are lost, friend!' said Zh&iacute;lin. 'That dog will
gather the Tartars together to hunt us down. Unless we can get a
<BR>couple of miles away from here we are lost!' And he thought to himself,
'Why the devil did I saddle myself with this block? I
<BR>should have got away long ago had I been alone.'

<P>'Go on alone,' said Kost&iacute;lin. 'Why should you perish because
of me?'

<P>'No I won't go. It won't do to desert a comrade.'

<P>Again he took Kost&iacute;lin on his shoulders and staggered on. They
went on in that way for another half-mile or more. They were
<BR>still in the forest, and could not see the end of it. But the mist
was already dispersing, and clouds seemed to be gathering, the
<BR>stars were no longer to be seen. Zh&iacute;lin was quite done up. They
came to a spring walled in with stones by the side of the path.
<BR>Zh&iacute;lin stopped and set Kost&iacute;lin down.

<P>'Let me have a rest and a drink,' said he, 'and let us eat some of the
cheese. It can't be much farther now.'

<P>But hardly had he lain down to get a drink, when he heard the sound
of horses' feet behind him. Again they darted to the right
<BR>among the bushes, and lay down under a steep slope.

<P>They heard Tartar voices. The Tartars stopped at the very spot where
they had turned off the path. The Tartars talked a bit,
<BR>and then seemed to be setting a dog on the scent. There was a sound
of crackling twigs, and a strange dog appeared from
<BR>behind the bushes. It stopped, and began to bark.

<P>Then the Tartars, also strangers, came climbing down, seized Zh&iacute;lin
and Kost&iacute;lin, bound them, put them on horses, and rode
<BR>away with them.

<P>When they had ridden about two miles, they met Abdul, their owner, with
two other Tartars following him. After talking with
<BR>the strangers, he put Zh&iacute;lin and Kost&iacute;lin on two of his
own horses and took them back to the Aoul.

<P>Abdul did not laugh now, and did not say a word to them.

<P>They were back at the Aoul by daybreak, and were set down in the street.
The children came crowding round, throwing
<BR>stones, shrieking, and beating them with whips.

<P>The Tartars gathered together in a circle, and the old man from the
foot of the hill was also there. They began discussing, and
<BR>Zh&iacute;lin heard them considering what should be done with him and
Kost&iacute;lin. Some said they ought to be sent farther into the
<BR>mountains; but the old man said: 'They must be killed!'

<P>Abdul disputed with him, saying: 'I gave money for them, and I must
get ransom for them.' But the old man said: 'They will pay
<BR>you nothing, but will only bring misfortune. It is a sin to feed Russians.
Kill them, and have done with it!'

<P>They dispersed. When they had gone, the master came up to Zh&iacute;lin
and said: 'If the money for your ransom is not sent within a
<BR>fortnight, I will flog you; and if you try to run away again, I'll
kill you like a dog! Write a letter, and write properly!'

<P>Paper was brought to them, and they wrote the letters. Shackles were
put on their feet, and they were taken behind the
<BR>Mosque to a deep pit about twelve feet square, into which they were
let down.

<P>VI

<P>Life was now very hard for them. Their shackles were never taken off,
and they were not let out into the fresh air. Unbaked
<BR>dough was thrown to them as if they were dogs, and water was let down
in a can.

<P>It was wet and close in the pit, and there was a horrible stench. Kost&iacute;lin
grew quite ill, his body became swollen and he ached
<BR>all over, and moaned or slept all the time. Zh&iacute;lin, too, grew
downcast; he saw it was a bad look-out, and could think of no way
<BR>of escape.

<P>He tried to make a tunnel, but there was nowhere to put the earth. His
master noticed it, and threatened to kill him.

<P>He was sitting on the floor of the pit one day, thinking of freedom
and feeling very downhearted, when suddenly a cake fell into
<BR>his lap, then another, and then a shower of cherries. He looked up,
and there was Dina. She looked at him, laughed, and ran
<BR>away. And Zh&iacute;lin thought: 'Might not Dina help me?'

<P>He cleared out a little place in the pit, scraped up some clay, and
began modelling toys. He made men, horses, and dogs,
<BR>thinking, 'When Dina comes I'll throw them up to her.'

<P>But Dina did not come next day. Zh&iacute;lin heard the tramp of horses;
some men rode past, and the Tartars gathered in council near
<BR>the Mosque. They shouted and argued; the word 'Russians' was repeated
several times. He could hear the voice of the old
<BR>man. Though he could not distinguish what was said, he guessed that
Russian troops were somewhere near, and that the
<BR>Tartars, afraid they might come into the Aoul, did not know what to
do with their prisoners.

<P>After talking awhile, they went away. Suddenly he heard a rustling overhead,
and saw Dina crouching at the edge of the pit, her
<BR>knees higher than her head, and bending over so that the coins of her
plait dangled above the pit. Her eyes gleamed like stars.
<BR>She drew two cheeses out of her sleeve and threw them to him. Zh&iacute;lin
took them and said, 'Why did you not come before? I
<BR>have made some toys for you. Here, catch!' And he began throwing the
toys up, one by one.

<P>But she shook her head and would not look at them.

<P>'I don't want any,' she said. She sat silent for awhile, and then went
on, 'Iv&aacute;n, they want to kill you!' And she pointed to her
<BR>own throat.

<P>'Who wants to kill me?'

<P>'Father; the old men say he must. But I am sorry for you!'

<P>Zh&iacute;lin answered: 'Well, if you are sorry for me, bring me a long
pole.'

<P>She shook her head, as much as to say, 'I can't!'

<P>He clasped his hands and prayed her: 'Dina, please do! Dear Dina, I
beg of you!'

<P>'I can't!' she said, 'they would see me bringing it. They're all at
home.' And she went away.

<P>So when evening came Zh&iacute;lin still sat looking up now and then,
and wondering what would happen. The stars were there, but
<BR>the moon had not yet risen. The Mullah's voice was heard; then all
was silent. Zh&iacute;lin was beginning to doze, thinking: 'The girl
<BR>will be afraid to do it!'

<P>Suddenly he felt clay falling on his head. He looked up, and saw a long
pole poking into the opposite wall of the pit. It kept
<BR>poking about for a time, and then it came down, sliding into the pit.
Zh&iacute;lin was glad indeed. He took hold of it and lowered it. It
<BR>was a strong pole, one that he had seen before on the roof of his master's
hut.

<P>He looked up. The stars were shining high in the sky, and just above
the pit Dina's eyes gleamed in the dark like a cat's. She
<BR>stooped with her face close to the edge of the pit, and whispered,
'Iv&aacute;n! Iv&aacute;n!' waving her hand in front of her face to show
that
<BR>he should speak low.

<P>'What?' said Zh&iacute;lin.

<P>'All but two have gone away.'

<P>Then Zh&iacute;lin said, 'Well, Kost&iacute;lin, come; let us have one
last try; I'll help you up.'

<P>But Kost&iacute;lin would not hear of it.

<P>'No,' said he, 'It's clear I can't get away from here. How can I go,
when I have hardly strength to turn round?'

<P>'Well, good-bye, then! Don't think ill of me!' and they kissed each
other. Zh&iacute;lin seized the pole, told Dina to hold on, and began
<BR>to climb. He slipped once or twice; the shackles hindered him. Kost&iacute;lin
helped him, and he managed to get to the top. Dina with
<BR>her little hands, pulled with all her might at his shirt, laughing.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin drew out the pole and said, 'Put it back in its place,
Dina, or they'll notice, and you will be beaten.'

<P>She dragged the pole away, and Zh&iacute;lin went down the hill. When
he had gone down the steep incline, he took a sharp stone
<BR>and tried to wrench the lock off the shackles. But it was a strong
lock and he could not manage to break it, and besides, it was
<BR>difficult to get at. Then he heard some one running down the hill,
springing lightly. He thought: 'Surely, that's Dina again.'

<P>Dina came, took a stone and said, 'Let me try.'

<P>She knelt down and tried to wrench the lock off, but her little hands
were as slender as little twigs, and she had not the strength.
<BR>She threw the stone away and began to cry. Then Zh&iacute;lin set to
work again at the lock, and Dina squatted beside him with her
<BR>hand on his shoulder.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin looked round and saw a red light to the left behind the
hill. The moon was just rising. 'Ah!' he thought, 'before the moon
<BR>has risen I must have passed the valley and be in the forest.' So he
rose and threw away the stone. Shackles or no, he must go
<BR>on.

<P>'Good-bye, Dina dear!' he said. 'I shall never forget you!'

<P>Dina seized hold of him and felt about with her hands for a place to
put some cheeses she had brought. He took them from her.

<P>'Thank you, my little one. Who will make dolls for you when I am gone?'
And he stroked her head.

<P>Dina burst into tears hiding her face in her hands. Then she ran up
the hill like a young goat, the coins in her plait clinking against
<BR>her back.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin crossed himself took the lock of his shackles in his hand
to prevent its clattering, and went along the road, dragging his
<BR>shackled leg, and looking towards the place where the moon was about
to rise. He now knew the way. If he went straight he
<BR>would have to walk nearly six miles. If only he could reach the wood
before the moon had quite risen! He crossed the river; the
<BR>light behind the hill was growing whiter. Still looking at it, he went
along the valley. The moon was not yet visible. The light
<BR>became brighter, and one side of the valley was growing lighter and
lighter, and shadows were drawing in towards the foot of
<BR>the hill, creeping nearer and nearer to him.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin went on, keeping in the shade. He was hurrying, but the
moon was moving still faster; the tops of the hills on the right
<BR>were already lit up. As he got near the wood the white moon appeared
from behind the hills, and it became light as day. One
<BR>could see all the leaves on the trees. It was light on the hill, but
silent, as if nothing were alive; no sound could be heard but the
<BR>gurgling of the river below.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin reached the wood without meeting any one, chose a dark
spot, and sat down to rest.

<P>He rested and ate one of the cheeses. Then he found a stone and set
to work again to knock off the shackles. He knocked his
<BR>hands sore, but could not break the lock. He rose and went along the
road. After walking the greater part of a mile he was
<BR>quite done up, and his feet were aching. He had to stop every ten steps.
'There is nothing else for it,' thought he. 'I must drag on
<BR>as long as I have any strength left. If I sit down, I shan't be able
to rise again. I can't reach the fortress; but when day breaks I'll
<BR>lie down in the forest, remain there all day, and go on again at night.'

<P>He went on all night. Two Tartars on horseback passed him; but he heard
them a long way off, and hid behind a tree.

<P>The moon began to grow paler, the dew to fall. It was getting near dawn,
and Zh&iacute;lin had not reached the end of the forest.
<BR>'Well,' thought he, 'I'll walk another thirty steps, and then turn
in among the trees and sit down.'

<P>He walked another thirty steps, and saw that he was at the end of the
forest. He went to the edge; it was now quite light, and
<BR>straight before him was the plain and the fortress. To the left, quite
close at the foot of the slope, a fire was dying out, and the
<BR>smoke from it spread round. There were men gathered about the fire.

<P>He looked intently, and saw guns glistening. They were soldiers -- Cossacks!

<P>Zh&iacute;lin was filled with joy. He collected his remaining strength
and set off down the hill, saying to himself: 'God forbid that any
<BR>mounted Tartar should see me now, in the open field! Near as I am,
I could not get there in time.'

<P>Hardly had he said this when, a couple of hundred yards off, on a hillock
to the left, he saw three Tartars.

<P>They saw him also and made a rush. His heart sank. He waved his hands,
and shouted with all his might, 'Brothers, brothers!
<BR>Help!'

<P>The Cossacks heard him, and a party of them on horseback darted to cut
across the Tartars' path. The Cossacks were far and
<BR>the Tartars were near; but Zh&iacute;lin, too, made a last effort.
Lifting the shackles with his hand, he ran towards the Cossacks, hardly
<BR>knowing what he was doing, crossing himself and shouting, 'Brothers!
Brothers! Brothers!'

<P>There were some fifteen Cossacks. The Tartars were frightened, and stopped
before reaching him. Zhilin staggered up to the
<BR>Cossacks.

<P>They surrounded him and began questioning him. 'Who are you? What are
you? Where from?

<P>But Zh&iacute;lin was quite beside himself, and could only weep and
repeat, 'Brothers! Brothers!'

<P>Then the soldiers came running up and crowded round Zh&iacute;lin --
one giving him bread, another buckwheat, a third v&oacute;dka: one
<BR>wrapping a cloak round him, another breaking his shackles.

<P>The officers recognized him, and rode with him to the fortress. The
soldiers were glad to see him back, and his comrades all
<BR>gathered round him.

<P>Zh&iacute;lin told them all that had happened to him.

<P>'That's the way I went home and got married!' said he. 'No. It seems
plain that fate was against it!'

<P>So he went on serving in the Caucasus. A month passed before Kost&iacute;lin
was released, after paying five thousand roubles
<BR>ransom. He was almost dead when they brought him back.
