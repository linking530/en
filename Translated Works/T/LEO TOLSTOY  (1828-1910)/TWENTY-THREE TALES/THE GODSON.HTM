<P>'Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for
a tooth, but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil.' -- Matt.
<BR>v. 38, 39.

<P>'Vengeance is mine; I will repay.' -- Rom. xii. 19.

<P>I

<P>A SON was born to a poor peasant. He was glad and went to his neighbour
to ask him to stand godfather to the boy. The
<BR>neighbour refused -- he did not like standing godfather to a poor man's
child. The peasant asked another neighbour, but he too
<BR>refused, and after that the poor father went to every house in the
village, but found no one willing to be godfather to his son. So he
<BR>set off to another village, and on the way he met a man who stopped
and said:

<P>'Good-day, my good man; where are you off to?'

<P>'God has given me a child,' said the peasant, 'to rejoice my eyes in
youth, to comfort my old age, and to pray for my soul after
<BR>death. But I am poor, and no one in our village will stand godfather
to him, so I am now on my way to seek a godfather for him
<BR>elsewhere.'

<P>'Let me be godfather,' said the stranger.

<P>The peasant was glad, and thanked him, but added: 'And whom shall I
ask to be godmother?'

<P>'Go to the town,' replied the stranger, 'and, in the square, you will
see a stone house with shop-windows in the front. At the
<BR>entrance you will find the tradesman to whom it belongs. Ask him to
let his daughter stand godmother to your child.'

<P>The peasant hesitated.

<P>'How can I ask a rich tradesman?' said he. 'He will despise me, and
will not let his daughter come.'

<P>'Don't trouble about that. Go and ask. Get everything ready by to-morrow
morning, and I will come to the christening.'

<P>The poor peasant returned home, and then drove to the town to find the
tradesman. He had hardly taken his horse into the yard,
<BR>when the tradesman himself came out.

<P>'What do you want?' said he.

<P>'Why, sir,' said the peasant, 'you see God has given me a son to rejoice
my eyes in youth, to comfort my old age, and to pray for
<BR>my soul after death. Be so kind as to let your daughter stand godmother
to him.

<P>'And when is the christening?' said the tradesman.

<P>'To-morrow morning.'

<P>'Very well. Go in peace. She shall be with you at Mass to-morrow morning.'

<P>The next day the godmother came, and the godfather also, and the infant
was baptized. Immediately after the christening the
<BR>godfather went away. They did not know who he was, and never saw him
again.

<P>II

<P>The child grew up to be a joy to his parents. He was strong, willing
to work, clever and obedient. When he was ten years old his
<BR>parents sent him to school to learn to read and write. What others
learnt in five years, he learnt in one, and soon there was nothing
<BR>more they could teach him.

<P>Easter came round, and the boy went to see his godmother, to give her
his Easter greeting.

<P>'Father and mother,' said he when he got home again, 'where does my
godfather live? I should like to give him my Easter greeting,
<BR>too.'

<P>And his father answered:

<P>'We know nothing about your godfather, dear son. We often regret it
ourselves. Since the day you were christened we have never
<BR>seen him, nor had any news of him. We do not know where he lives, or
even whether he is still alive.'

<P>The son bowed to his parents.

<P>'Father and mother,' said he, 'let me go and look for my godfather.
I must find him and give him my Easter greeting.

<P>So his father and mother let him go, and the boy set off to find his
godfather.

<P>III

<P>The boy left the house and set out along the road. He had been walking
for several hours when he met a stranger who stopped
<BR>him and said:

<P>'Good-day to you, my boy. Where are you going?'

<P>And the boy answered:

<P>'I went to see my godmother and to give her my Easter greeting, and
when I got home I asked my parents where my godfather
<BR>lives, that I might go and greet him also. They told me they did not
know. They said he went away as soon as I was christened,
<BR>and they know nothing about him, not even if he be still alive. But
I wished to see my godfather, and so I have set out to look for
<BR>him.'

<P>Then the stranger said: 'I am your godfather.'

<P>The boy was glad to hear this. After kissing his godfather three times
for an Easter greeting, he asked him:

<P>'Which way are you going now, godfather? If you are coming our way,
please come to our house; but if you are going home, I will
<BR>go with you.'

<P>'I have no time now,' replied his godfather, 'to come to your house.
I have business in several villages; but I shall return home
<BR>again to-morrow. Come and see me then.'

<P>'But how shall I find you, godfather?'

<P>'When you leave home, go straight towards the rising sun, and you will
come to a forest; going through the forest you will come to
<BR>a glade. When you reach this glade sit down and rest awhile, and look
around you and see what happens. On the further side of
<BR>the forest you will find a garden, and in it a house with a golden
roof. That is my home. Go up to the gate, and I will myself be
<BR>there to meet you.'

<P>And having said this the godfather disappeared from his godson's sight.

<P>IV

<P>The boy did as his godfather had told him. He walked eastward until
he reached a forest, and there he came to a glade, and in the
<BR>midst of the glade he saw a pine tree to a branch of which was tied
a rope supporting a heavy log of oak. Close under this log
<BR>stood a wooden trough filled with honey. Hardly had the boy had time
to wonder why the honey was placed there, and why the log
<BR>hung above it, when he heard a crackling in the wood, and saw some
bears approaching; a she-bear, followed by a yearling and
<BR>three tiny cubs. The she-bear, sniffing the air, went straight to the
trough, the cubs following her. She thrust her muzzle into the
<BR>honey, and called the cubs to do the same. They scampered up and began
to eat. As they did so, the log, which the she-bear had
<BR>moved aside with her head, swung away a little and, returning, gave
the cubs a push. Seeing this the she-bear shoved the log away
<BR>with her paw. It swung further out and returned more forcibly, striking
one cub on the back and another on the head. The cubs ran
<BR>away howling with pain, and the mother, with a growl, caught the log
in her fore paws and, raising it above her head flung it away.
<BR>The log flew high in the air and the yearling, rushing to the trough,
pushed his muzzle into the honey and began to suck noisily. The
<BR>others also drew near, but they had not reached the trough when the
log, flying back, struck the yearling on the head and killed
<BR>him. The mother growled louder than before and, seizing the log, flung
it from her with all her might. It flew higher than the branch
<BR>it was tied to; so high that the rope slackened; and the she-bear returned
to the trough, and the little cubs after her. The log flew
<BR>higher and higher, then stopped, and began to fall. The nearer it came
the faster it swung, and at last, at full speed, it crashed down
<BR>on her head. The she-bear rolled over, her legs jerked and she died!
The cubs ran away into the forest.

<P>V

<P>The boy watched all this in surprise, and then continued his way. Leaving
the forest, he came upon a large garden in the midst of
<BR>which stood a lofty palace with a golden roof. At the gate stood his
godfather, smiling. He welcomed his godson, and led him
<BR>through the gateway into the garden. The boy had never dreamed of such
beauty and delight as surrounded him in that place.

<P>Then his godfather led him into the palace, which was even more beautiful
inside than outside. The godfather showed the boy
<BR>through all the rooms: each brighter and finer than the other, but
at last they came to one door that was sealed up.

<P>'You see this door,' said he. 'It is not locked, but only sealed. It
can be opened, but I forbid you to open it. You may live here, and
<BR>go where you please and enjoy all the delights of the place. My only
command is -- do not open that door! But should you ever do
<BR>so, remember what you saw in the forest.'

<P>Having said this the godfather went away. The godson remained in the
palace, and life there was so bright and joyful that he
<BR>thought he had only been there three hours, when he had really lived
there thirty years. When thirty years had gone by, the godson
<BR>happened to be passing the sealed door one day, and he wondered why
his godfather had forbidden him to enter that room.

<P>'I'll just look in and see what is there,' thought he, and he gave the
door a push. The seals gave way, the door opened, and the
<BR>godson entering saw a hall more lofty and beautiful than all the others,
and in the midst of it a throne. He wandered about the hall
<BR>for a while, and then mounted the steps and seated himself upon the
throne. As he sat there he noticed a sceptre leaning against
<BR>the throne, and took it in his hand. Hardly had he done so when the
four walls of the hall suddenly disappeared. The godson looked
<BR>around, and saw the whole world, and all that men were doing in it.
He looked in front, and saw the sea with ships sailing on it. He
<BR>looked to the right, and saw where strange heathen people lived. He
looked to the left, and saw where men who were Christians,
<BR>but not Russians, lived. He looked round, and on the fourth side, he
saw Russian people, like himself.

<P>'I will look,' said he, 'and see what is happening at home, and whether
the harvest is good.'

<P>He looked towards his father's fields and saw the sheaves standing in
stooks. He began counting them to see whether there was
<BR>much corn, when he noticed a peasant driving in a cart. It was night,
and the godson thought it was his father coming to cart the
<BR>corn by night. But as he looked he recognized Vas&iacute;ly Koudryash&oacute;f,
the thief, driving into the field and beginning to load the
<BR>sheaves on to his cart. This made the godson angry, and he called out:

<P>'Father, the sheaves are being stolen from our field!'

<P>His father, who was out with the horses in the night-pasture, woke up.

<P>'I dreamt the sheaves were being stolen,' said he. 'I will just ride
down and see.'

<P>So he got on a horse and rode out to the field. Finding Vas&iacute;ly
there, he called together other peasants to help him, and Vas&iacute;ly
was
<BR>beaten, bound, and taken to prison.

<P>Then the godson looked at the town, where his godmother lived. He saw
that she was now married to a tradesman. She lay
<BR>asleep, and her husband rose and went to his mistress. The godson shouted
to her:

<P>'Get up, get up, your husband has taken to evil ways.'

<P>The godmother jumped up and dressed, and finding out where her husband
was, she shamed and beat his mistress, and drove him
<BR>away.

<P>Then the godson looked for his mother, and saw her lying asleep in her
cottage. And a thief crept into the cottage and began to
<BR>break open the chest in which she kept her things. The mother awoke
and screamed, and the robber seizing an axe, swung it over
<BR>his head to kill her.

<P>The godson could not refrain from hurling the sceptre at the robber.
It struck him upon the temple, and killed him on the spot.

<P>VI

<P>As soon as the godson had killed the robber, the walls closed and the
hall became just as it had been before.

<P>Then the door opened and the godfather entered, and coming up to his
godson he took him by the hand and led him down from the
<BR>throne.

<P>'You have not obeyed my command,' said he. 'You did one wrong thing,
when you opened the forbidden door; another, when you
<BR>mounted the throne and took my sceptre into your hands; and you have
now done a third wrong, which has much increased the
<BR>evil in the world. Had you sat here an hour longer, you would have
ruined half mankind.'

<P>Then the godfather led his godson back to the throne, and took the sceptre
in his hand; and again the walls fell asunder and all
<BR>things became visible. And the godfather said:

<P>'See what you have done to your father. Vas&iacute;ly has now been a
year in prison, and has come out having learnt every kind of
<BR>wickedness, and has become quite incorrigible. See, he has stolen two
of your father's horses, and he is now setting fire to his
<BR>barn. All this you have brought upon your father.'

<P>The godson saw his father's barn breaking into flames, but his godfather
shut off the sight from him, and told him to look another
<BR>way.

<P>'Here is your godmother's husband,' he said. 'It is a year since he
left his wife, and now he goes after other women. His former
<BR>mistress has sunk to still lower depths. Sorrow has driven his wife
to drink. That's what you have done to your godmother.'

<P>The godfather shut off this also, and showed the godson his father's
house. There he saw his mother weeping for her sins,
<BR>repenting, and saying:

<P>'It would have been better had the robber killed me that night. I should
not have sinned so heavily.'

<P>'That,' said the godfather, 'is what you have done to your mother.'

<P>He shut this off also, and pointed downwards; and the godson saw two
warders holding the robber in front of a prison-house.

<P>And the godfather said:

<P>'This man had murdered ten men. He should have expiated his sins himself,
but by killing him you have taken his sins on yourself.
<BR>Now you must answer for all his sins. That is what you have done to
yourself. The she-bear pushed the log aside once, and
<BR>disturbed her cubs; she pushed it again, and killed her yearling; she
pushed it a third time, and was killed herself. You have done
<BR>the same. Now I give you thirty years to go into the world and atone
for the robber's sins. If you do not atone for them, you will
<BR>have to take his place.'

<P>'How am I to atone for his sins?' asked the godson.

<P>And the godfather answered:

<P>'When you have rid the world of as much evil as you have brought into
it, you will have atoned both for your own sins and for
<BR>those of the robber.'

<P>'How can I destroy evil in the world?' the godson asked.

<P>'Go out,' replied the godfather, 'and walk straight towards the rising
sun. After a time you will come to a field with some men in it.
<BR>Notice what they are doing, and teach them what you know. Then go on
and note what you see. On the fourth day you will come
<BR>to a forest. In the midst of the forest is a cell and in the cell lives
a hermit. Tell him all that has happened. He will teach you what
<BR>to do. When you have done all he tells you, you will have atoned for
your own and the robber's sins.'

<P>And, having said this, the godfather led his godson out of the gate.

<P>VII

<P>The godson went his way, and as he went he thought: How am I to destroy
evil in the world? Evil is destroyed by banishing evil
<BR>men, keeping them in prison, or putting them to death. How then am
I to destroy evil without taking the sins of others upon
<BR>myself?'

<P>The godson pondered over it for a long time, but could come to no conclusion.
He went on until he came to a field where corn was
<BR>growing thick and good and ready for the reapers. The godson saw that
a little calf had got in among the corn. Some men who
<BR>were at hand saw it, and mounting their horses they chased it backwards
and forwards through the corn. Each time the calf was
<BR>about to come out of the corn some one rode up and the calf got frightened
and turned back again, and they all galloped after it,
<BR>trampling down the corn. On the road stood a woman crying.

<P>'They will chase my calf to death,' she said.

<P>And the godson said to the peasants:

<P>'What are you doing? Come out of the cornfield all of you, and let the
woman call her calf.'

<P>The men did so; and the woman came to the edge of the cornfield and
called to the calf. 'Come along browney, come along,' said
<BR>she. The calf pricked up its ears, listened a while, and then ran towards
the woman of its own accord, and hid its head in her skirts,
<BR>almost knocking her over. The men were glad the woman was glad, and
so was the little calf.

<P>The godson went on, and he thought:

<P>'Now I see that evil spreads evil. The more people try to drive away
evil, the more the evil grows. Evil, it seems, cannot be
<BR>destroyed by evil; but in what way it can be destroyed, I do not know.
The calf obeyed its mistress and so all went well; but if it
<BR>had not obeyed her, how could we have got it out of the field?'

<P>The godson pondered again, but came to no conclusion, and continued
his way.

<P>VIII

<P>He went on until he came to a village. At the furthest end he stopped
and asked leave to stay the night. The woman of the house
<BR>was there alone, house-cleaning, and she let him in. The godson entered,
and taking his seat upon the brick oven he watched what
<BR>the woman was doing. He saw her finish scrubbing the room and begin
scrubbing the table. Having done this, she began wiping
<BR>the table with a dirty cloth. She wiped it from side to side -- but
it did not come clean. The soiled cloth left streaks of dirt. Then she
<BR>wiped it the other way. The first streaks disappeared, but others came
in their place. Then she wiped it from one end to the other,
<BR>but again the same thing happened. The soiled cloth messed the table;
when one streak was wiped off another was left on. The
<BR>godson watched for awhile in silence, and then said:

<P>'What are you doing, mistress?'

<P>'Don't you see I'm cleaning up for the holiday. Only I can't manage
this table, it won't come clean. I'm quite tired out.'

<P>'You should rinse your cloth,' said the godson, 'before you wipe the
table with it.'

<P>The woman did so, and soon had the table clean.

<P>'Thank you for telling me,' said she.

<P>In the morning he took leave of the woman and went on his way. After
walking a good while, he came to the edge of a forest.
<BR>There he saw some peasants who were making wheel-rims of bent wood.
Coming nearer, the godson saw that the men were
<BR>going round and round, but could not bend the wood.

<P>He stood and looked on, and noticed that the block, to which the piece
of wood was fastened, was not fixed, but as the men
<BR>moved round it went round too. Then the godson said:

<P>'What are you doing, friends?'

<P>'Why, don't you see, we are making wheel rims. We have twice steamed
the wood, and are quite tired out, but the wood will not
<BR>bend.'

<P>'You should fix the block, friends,' said the godson, 'or else it goes
round when you do.'

<P>The peasants took his advice and fixed the block, and then the work
went on merrily.

<P>The godson spent the night with them, and then went on. He walked all
day and all night, and just before dawn he came upon
<BR>some drovers encamped for the night, and lay down beside them. He saw
that they had got all their cattle settled, and were trying
<BR>to light a fire. They had taken dry twigs and lighted them, but before
the twigs had time to burn up, they smothered them with
<BR>damp brushwood. The brushwood hissed and the fire smouldered and went
out. Then the drovers brought more dry wood, lit it,
<BR>and again put on the brushwood -- and again the fire went out. They
struggled with it for a long time, but could not get the fire to
<BR>burn. Then the godson said:

<P>'Do not be in such a hurry to put on the brushwood. Let the dry wood
burn up properly before you put any on. When the fire is
<BR>well alight you can put on as much as you please.'

<P>The drovers followed his advice. They let the fire burn up fiercely
before adding the brushwood, which then flared up so that they
<BR>soon had a roaring fire.

<P>The godson remained with them for a while, and then continued his way.
He went on, wondering what the three things he had
<BR>seen might mean; but he could not fathom them.

<P>IX

<P>The godson walked the whole of that day, and in the evening came to
another forest. There he found a hermit's cell, at which he
<BR>knocked.

<P>'Who is there?' asked a voice from within.

<P>'A great sinner,' replied the godson. I must atone for another's sins
as well as for my own.

<P>The hermit hearing this came out.

<P>'What sins are those that you have to bear for another?'

<P>The godson told him everything: about his godfather; about the she-bear
with the cubs; about the throne in the sealed room; about
<BR>the commands his godfather had given him, as well as about the peasants
he had seen trampling down the corn, and the calf that
<BR>ran out when its mistress called it.

<P>'I have seen that one cannot destroy evil by evil,' said he, 'but I
cannot understand how it is to be destroyed. Teach me how it can
<BR>be done.

<P>'Tell me,' replied the hermit, 'what else you have seen on your way.'

<P>The godson told him about the woman washing the table, and the men making
cart-wheels, and the drovers fighting their fire.

<P>The hermit listened to it all, and then went back to his cell and brought
out an old jagged axe.

<P>'Come with me,' said he.

<P>When they had gone some way, the hermit pointed to a tree.

<P>'Cut it down,' he said.

<P>The godson felled the tree.

<P>'Now chop it into three,' said the hermit.

<P>The godson chopped the tree into three pieces. Then the hermit went
back to his cell, and brought out some blazing sticks.

<P>'Burn those three logs,' said he.

<P>So the godson made a fire, and burnt the three logs till only three
charred stumps remained.

<P>'Now plant them half in the ground, like this.'

<P>The godson did so.

<P>'You see that river at the foot of the hill. Bring water from there
in your mouth, and water these stumps. Water this stump, as you
<BR>taught the woman: this one as you taught the wheel-wrights: and this
one, as you taught the drovers. When all three have taken
<BR>root and from these charred stumps apple-trees have sprung you will
know how to destroy evil in men, and will have atoned for all
<BR>your sins.'

<P>Having said this, the hermit returned to his cell. The godson pondered
for a long time, but could not understand what the hermit
<BR>meant. Nevertheless he set to work to do as he had been told.

<P>The godson went down to the river, filled his mouth with water, and
returning, emptied it on to one of the charred stumps. This he
<BR>did again and again, and watered all three-stumps. When he was hungry
and quite tired out, he went to the cell to ask the old
<BR>hermit for some food. He opened the door, and there upon a bench he
saw the old man lying dead. The godson looked round for
<BR>food, and he found some dried bread and ate a little of it. Then he
took a spade and set to work to dig the hermit's grave. During
<BR>the night he carried water and watered the stumps, and in the day he
dug the grave. He had hardly finished the grave and was
<BR>about to bury the corpse, when some people from the village came, bringing
food for the old man.

<P>The people heard that the old hermit was dead, and that he had given
the godson his blessing, and left him in his place. So they
<BR>buried the old man, gave the bread they had brought to the godson,
and promising to bring him some more, they went away.

<P>The godson remained in the old man's place. There he lived, eating the
food people brought him, and doing as he had been told:
<BR>carrying water from the river in his mouth and watering the charred
stumps.

<P>He lived thus for a year, and many people visited him. His fame spread
abroad, as a holy man who lived in the forest and brought
<BR>water from the bottom of a hill in his mouth to water charred stumps
for the salvation of his soul. People flocked to see him. Rich
<BR>merchants drove up bringing him presents, but he kept only the barest
necessaries for himself, and gave the rest away to the poor.

<P>And so the godson lived: carrying water in his mouth and watering the
stumps half the day, and resting and receiving people the
<BR>other half. And he began to think that this was the way he had been
told to live, in order to destroy evil and atone for his sins.

<P>He spent two years in this manner, not omitting for a single day to
water the stumps. But still not one of them sprouted.

<P>One day, as he sat in his cell, he heard a man ride past, singing as
he went. The godson came out to see what sort of a man it
<BR>was. He saw a strong young fellow, well dressed, and mounted on a handsome,
well-saddled horse.

<P>The godson stopped him, and asked him who he was, and where he was going.

<P>'I am a robber,' the man answered, drawing rein. 'I ride about the highways
killing people; and the more I kill, the merrier are the
<BR>songs I sing.'

<P>The godson was horror-struck, and thought:

<P>'How can the evil be destroyed in such a man as this? It is easy to
speak to those who come to me of their own accord and
<BR>confess their sins. But this one boasts of the evil he does.'

<P>So he said nothing, and turned away, thinking: 'What am I to do now?
This robber may take to riding about here, and he will
<BR>frighten away the people. They will leave off coming to me. It will
be a loss to them, and I shall not know how to live.'

<P>So the godson turned back, and said to the robber:

<P>'People come to me here, not to boast of their sins, but to repent,
and to pray for forgiveness. Repent of your sins, if you fear God;
<BR>but if there is no repentance in your heart, then go away and never
come here again. Do not trouble me, and do not frighten people
<BR>away from me. If you do not hearken, God will punish you.'

<P>The robber laughed:

<P>'I am not afraid of God, and I will not listen to you. You are not my
master,' said he. 'You live by your piety, and I by my robbery.
<BR>We all must live. You may teach the old women who come to you, but
you have nothing to teach me. And because you have
<BR>reminded me of God, I will kill two more men tomorrow. I would kill
you, but I do not want to soil my hands just now. See that in
<BR>future you keep out of my way!'

<P>Having uttered this threat, the robber rode away. He did not come again,
and the godson lived in peace, as before, for eight more
<BR>years.

<P>XI

<P>One night the godson watered his stumps, and, after returning to his
cell, he sat down to rest, and watched the footpath, wondering
<BR>if some one would soon come. But no one came at all that day. He sat
alone till evening, feeling lonely and dull, and he thought
<BR>about his past life. Ho remembered how the robber had reproached him
for living by his piety; and he reflected on his way of life.
<BR>'I am not living as the hermit commanded me to,' thought he. 'The hermit
laid a penance upon me, and I have made both a living
<BR>and fame out of it; and have been so tempted by it, that now I feel
dull when people do not come to me; and when they do come, I
<BR>only rejoice because they praise my holiness. That is not how one should
live. I have been led astray by love of praise. I have not
<BR>atoned for my past sins, but have added fresh ones. I will go to another
part of the forest where people will not find me; and I will
<BR>live so as to atone for my old sins and commit no fresh ones.'

<P>Having come to this conclusion the godson filled a bag with dried bread
and, taking a spade, left the cell and started for a ravine he
<BR>knew of in a lonely spot, where he could dig himself a cave and hide
from the people.

<P>As he was going along with his bag and his spade he saw the robber riding
towards him. The godson was frightened, and started
<BR>to run away, but the robber overtook him.

<P>'Where are you going?' asked the robber.

<P>The godson told him he wished to get away from the people and live somewhere
where no one would come to him. This surprised
<BR>the robber.

<P>'What will you live on, if people do not come to see you?' asked he.

<P>The godson had not even thought of this, but the robber's question reminded
him that food would be necessary.

<P>'On what God pleases to give me,' he replied.

<P>The robber said nothing, and rode away.

<P>'Why did I not say anything to him about his way of life?' thought the
godson. 'He might repent now. To-day he seems in a gentler
<BR>mood, and has not threatened to kill me.' And he shouted to the robber:

<P>'You have still to repent of your sins. You cannot escape from God.'

<P>The robber turned his horse, and drawing a knife from his girdle threatened
the hermit with it. The latter was alarmed, and ran
<BR>away further into the forest.

<P>The robber did not follow him, but only shouted:

<P>'Twice I have let you off, old man, but next time you come in my way
I will kill you!'

<P>Having said this, he rode away. In the evening when the godson went
to water his stumps -- one of them was sprouting! A little
<BR>apple tree was growing out of it.

<P>XII

<P>After hiding himself from everybody, the godson lived all alone. When
his supply of bread was exhausted, he thought: 'Now I must
<BR>go and look for some roots to eat.' He had not gone far, however, before
he saw a bag of dried bread hanging on a branch. He
<BR>took it down, and as long as it lasted he lived upon that.

<P>When he had eaten it all, he found another bagful on the same branch.
So he lived on, his only trouble being his fear of the robber.
<BR>Whenever he heard the robber passing he hid thinking:

<P>'He may kill me before I have had time to atone for my sins.'

<P>In this way he lived for ten more years. The one apple-tree continued
to grow, but the other two stumps remained exactly as they
<BR>were.

<P>One morning the godson rose early and went to his work. By the time
he had thoroughly moistened the ground round the stumps,
<BR>he was tired out and sat down to rest. As he sat there he thought to
himself:

<P>'I have sinned, and have become afraid of death. It may be God's will
that I should redeem my sins by death.'

<P>Hardly had this thought crossed his mind when he heard the robber riding
up, swearing at something. When the godson heard this,
<BR>he thought:

<P>'No evil and no good can befall me from any one but from God.'

<P>And he went to meet the robber. He saw the robber was not alone, but
behind him on the saddle sat another man, gagged, and
<BR>bound hand and foot. The man was doing nothing, but the robber was
abusing him violently. The godson went up and stood in front
<BR>of the horse.

<P>'Where are you taking this man?' he asked.

<P>'Into the forest,' replied the robber. 'He is a merchant's son, and
will not tell me where his father's money is hidden. I am going to
<BR>flog him till he tells me.'

<P>And the robber spurred on his horse, but the godson caught hold of his
bridle, and would not let him pass.

<P>'Let this man go!' he said.

<P>The robber grew angry, and raised his arm to strike.

<P>'Would you like a taste of what I am going to give this man? Have I
not promised to kill you? Let go!'

<P>The godson was not afraid.

<P>'You shall not go,' said he. 'I do not fear you. I fear no one but God,
and He wills that I should not let you pass. Set this man free!'

<P>The robber frowned, and snatching out his knife, cut the ropes with
which the merchant's son was bound, and set him free.

<P>'Get away both of you,' he said, 'and beware hour you cross my path
again.'

<P>The merchant's son jumped down and ran away. The robber was about to
ride on, but the godson stopped him again, and again
<BR>spoke to him about giving up his evil life. The robber heard him to
the end in silence, and then rode away without a word.

<P>The next morning the godson went to water his stumps and lo! the second
stump was sprouting. A second young apple-tree had
<BR>begun to grow.

<P>XIII

<P>Another ten years had gone by. The godson was sitting quietly one day,
desiring nothing, fearing nothing, and with a heart full of
<BR>joy.

<P>'What blessings God showers on men!' thought he. 'Yet how needlessly
they torment themselves. What prevents them from living
<BR>happily?'

<P>And remembering all the evil in men, and the troubles they bring upon
themselves, his heart filled with pity.

<P>'It is wrong of me to live as I do,' he said to himself. 'I must go
and teach others what I have myself learnt.'

<P>Hardly had he thought this, when he heard the robber approaching. He
let him pass, thinking:

<P>'It is no good talking to him, he will not understand.'

<P>That was his first thought, but ho changed his mind and went out into
the road. He saw that the robber was gloomy, and was riding
<BR>with downcast eyes. The godson looked at him, pitied him, and running
up to him laid his hand upon his knee.

<P>'Brother, dear,' said he, 'have some pity on your own soul! In you lives
the spirit of God. You suffer, and torment others, and lay up
<BR>more and more suffering for the future. Yet God loves you, and has
prepared such blessings for you. Do not ruin yourself utterly.
<BR>Change your life!'

<P>The robber frowned and turned away.

<P>'Leave me alone!' said he.

<P>But the godson held the robber still faster, and began to weep.

<P>Then the robber lifted his eyes and looked at the godson. He looked
at him for a long time, and alighting from his horse, fell on his
<BR>knees at the godson's feet.

<P>'You have overcome me, old man,' said he. 'For twenty years I have resisted
you, but now you have conquered me. Do what you
<BR>will with me, for I have no more power over myself. When you first
tried to persuade me, it only angered me more. Only when
<BR>you hid yourself from men did I begin to consider your words: for I
saw then that you asked nothing of them for yourself. Since
<BR>that day I have brought food for you, hanging it upon the tree.'

<P>Then the godson remembered that the woman got her table clean only after
she had rinsed her cloth. In the same way, it was only
<BR>when he ceased caring about himself, and cleansed his own heart, that
he was able to cleanse the hearts of others.

<P>The robber went on.

<P>'When I saw that you did not fear death, my heart turned.'

<P>Then the godson remembered that the wheel-wrights could not bend the
rims until they had fixed their block. So, not till he had
<BR>cast away the fear of death and made his life fast in God, could he
subdue this man's unruly heart.

<P>'But my heart did not quite melt,' continued the robber, 'until you
pitied me and wept for me.'

<P>The godson, full of joy, led the robber to the place where the stumps
were. And when they got there, they saw that from the third
<BR>stump an apple-tree had begun to sprout. And the godson remembered
that the drovers had not been able to light the damp wood
<BR>until the fire had burnt up well. So it was only when his own heart
burnt warmly, that another's heart had been kindled by it.

<P>And the godson was full of joy that he had at last atoned for his sins.

<P>He told all this to the robber, and died. The robber buried him, and
lived as the godson had commanded him, teaching to others
<BR>what the godson had taught him.
