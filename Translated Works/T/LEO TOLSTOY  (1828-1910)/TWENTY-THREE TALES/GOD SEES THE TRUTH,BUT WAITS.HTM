<P>IN the town of Vlad&iacute;mir lived a young merchant named Iv&aacute;n
Dm&iacute;tritch Aksy&oacute;nof. He had two shops and a house of his own.

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof was a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full
of fun, and very fond of singing. When quite a young man he
<BR>had been given to drink, and was riotous when he had had too much,
but after he married he gave up drinking, except now and
<BR>then.

<P>One summer Aksy&oacute;nof was going to the N&iacute;zhny Fair, and
as he bade good-bye to his family his wife said to him, 'Iv&aacute;n
<BR>Dm&iacute;tritch, do not start to-day; I have had a bad dream about
you.'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof laughed, and said, 'You are afraid that when I get to
the fair I shall go on the spree.'

<P>His wife replied: 'I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is
that I had a bad dream. I dreamt you returned from the town,
<BR>and when you took off your cap I saw that your hair was quite grey.'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof laughed. 'That's a lucky sign,' said he. 'See if I don't
sell out all my goods, and bring you some presents from the fair.'

<P>So he said good-bye to his family, and drove away.

<P>When he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew, and
they put up at the same inn for the night. They had
<BR>some tea together, and then went to bed in adjoining rooms.

<P>It was not Aksy&oacute;nof's habit to sleep late, and, wishing to travel
while it was still cool, he aroused his driver before dawn, and
<BR>told him to put in the horses.

<P>Then he made his way across to the landlord of the inn (who lived in
a cottage at the back), paid his bill, and continued his
<BR>journey.

<P>When he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped for the horses
to be fed. Aksy&oacute;nof rested awhile in the passage of the
<BR>inn, then he stepped out into the porch and, ordering a samov&aacute;r[1]
to be heated got out his guitar and began to play.

<P>Suddenly a tr&oacute;yka[2] drove up with tinkling bells, and an official
alighted, followed by two soldiers. He came to Aksy&oacute;nof and
<BR>began to question him, asking him who he was and whence he came. Aksy&oacute;nof
answered him fully, and said, 'Won't you have
<BR>some tea with me?' But the official went on cross-questioning him and
asking him, 'Where did you spend last night? Were you
<BR>alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did you see the other merchant this
morning? Why did you leave the inn before dawn?'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he
described all that had happened, and then added, 'Why do
<BR>you cross-question me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling
on business of my own, and there is no need to question
<BR>me.'

<P>Then the official, calling the soldiers, said, 'I am the police-officer
of this district, and I question you because the merchant with
<BR>whom you spent last night has been found with his throat cut. We must
search your things.'

<P>They entered the house. The soldiers and the police-officer unstrapped
Aksy&oacute;nof's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the
<BR>officer drew a knife out of a bag, crying, 'Whose knife is this?'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from
his bag, he was frightened.

<P>'How is it there is blood on this knife?'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and
only stammered: 'I -- I don't know -- not mine.'

<P>Then the police-officer said, 'This morning the merchant was found in
bed with his throat cut. You are the only person who
<BR>could have done it. The house was locked from inside, and no one else
was there. Here is this bloodstained knife in your bag,
<BR>and your face and manner betray you! Tell me how you killed him, and
how much money you stole?'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof swore he had not done it; that he had not seen the merchant
after they had had tea together; that he had no money
<BR>except eight thousand roubles[3] of his own, and that the knife was
not his. But his voice was broken, his face pale, and he
<BR>trembled with fear as though he were guilty.

<P>The police-officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksy&oacute;nof and
to put him in the cart. As they tied his feet together and flung him
<BR>into the cart, Aksy&oacute;nof crossed himself and wept. His money
and goods were taken from him, and he was sent to the nearest
<BR>town and imprisoned there. Enquiries as to his character were made
in Vlad&iacute;mir. The merchants and other inhabitants of that
<BR>town said that in former days he used to drink and waste his time,
but that he was a good man. Then the trial came on: he was
<BR>charged with murdering a merchant from Ryaz&aacute;n, and robbing him
of twenty thousand roubles.

<P>His wife was in despair, and did not know what to believe. Her children
were all quite small; one was a baby at her breast.
<BR>Taking them all with her, she went to the town where her husband was
in gaol. At first she was not allowed to see him; but,
<BR>after much begging, she obtained permission from the officials, and
was taken to him. When she saw her husband in
<BR>prison-dress and in chains, shut up with thieves and criminals, she
fell down, and did not come to her senses for a long time.
<BR>Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near him. She told
him of things at home, and asked about what had
<BR>happened to him. He told her all, and she asked, 'What can we do now?'

<P>'We must petition the Tsar not to let an innocent man perish.'

<P>His wife told him that she had sent a petition to the Tsar, but that
it had not been accepted.

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof did not reply, but only looked downcast.

<P>Then his wife said, 'It was not for nothing I dreamt your hair had turned
grey. You remember? You should not have started that
<BR>day.' And passing her fingers through his hair, she said: 'V&aacute;nya
dearest, tell your wife the truth; was it not you who did it?'

<P>'So you, too, suspect me!' said Aksy&oacute;nof, and hiding his face
in his hands, he began to weep. Then a soldier came to say that
<BR>the wife and children must go away; and Aksy&oacute;nof said good-bye
to his family for the last time.

<P>When they were gone, Aksy&oacute;nof recalled what had been said, and
when he remembered that his wife also had suspected him,
<BR>he said to himself, 'It seems that only God can know the truth, it
is to Him alone we must appeal, and from Him alone expect
<BR>mercy.'

<P>And Aksy&oacute;nof wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only
prayed to God.

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. So
he was flogged with a knout, and when the wounds made
<BR>by the knout were healed, he was driven to Siberia with other convicts.

<P>For twenty-six years Aksy&oacute;nof lived as a convict in Siberia.
His hair turned white as snow and his beard grew long, thin, and
<BR>grey. All his mirth went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little,
and never laughed, but he often prayed.

<P>In prison Aksy&oacute;nof learnt to make boots, and earned a little
money, with which he bought The Lives of the Saints. He read
<BR>this book when there was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays
in the prison-church he read the lessons and sang in the
<BR>choir; for his voice was still good.

<P>The prison authorities liked Aksy&oacute;nof for his meekness, and his
fellow-prisoners respected him: they called him 'Grandfather,'
<BR>and 'The Saint.' When they wanted to petition the prison authorities
about anything, they always made Aksy&oacute;nof their
<BR>spokesman, and when there were quarrels among the prisoners they came
to him to put things right, and to judge the matter.

<P>No news reached Aksy&oacute;nof from his home, and he did not even know
if his wife and children were still alive.

<P>One day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening
the old prisoners collected round the new ones and asked
<BR>them what towns or villages they came from, and what they were sentenced
for. Among the rest Aksy&oacute;nof sat down near the
<BR>new-comers, and listened with downcast air to what was said.

<P>One of the new convicts, a tall, strong man of sixty, with a closely-cropped
grey beard, was telling the others what he had been
<BR>arrested for.

<P>'Well, friends,' he said, 'I only took a horse that was tied to a sledge,
and I was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had
<BR>only taken it to get home quicker, and had then let it go; besides,
the driver was a personal friend of mine. So I said, "It's all
<BR>right." "No," said they, "you stole it." But how or where I stole it
they could not say. I once really did something wrong, and
<BR>ought by rights to have come here long ago, but that time I was not
found out. Now I have been sent here for nothing at all. . . .
<BR>Eh, but it's lies I'm telling you; I've been to Siberia before, but
I did not stay long.'

<P>'Where are you from?' asked some one.

<P>'From Vlad&iacute;mir. My family are of that town. My name is Mak&aacute;r,
and they also call me Semy&oacute;nitch.'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof raised his head and said: 'Tell me, Semy&oacute;nitch,
do you know anything of the merchants Aksy&oacute;nof, of Vlad&iacute;mir?
Are
<BR>they still alive?'

<P>'Know them? Of course I do. The Aksy&oacute;nofs are rich, though their
father is in Siberia: a sinner like ourselves, it seems! As for
<BR>you, Gran'dad, how did you come here?'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof did not like to speak of his misfortune. He only sighed,
and said, 'For my sins I have been in prison these twenty-six
<BR>years.'

<P>'What sins?' asked Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch.

<P>But Aksy&oacute;nof only said, 'Well, well -- I must have deserved it!'
He would have said no more, but his companions told the
<BR>new-comer how Aksy&oacute;nof came to be in Siberia: how some one had
killed a merchant and had put a knife among Aksy&oacute;nof's
<BR>things, and Aksy&oacute;nof had been unjustly condemned.

<P>When Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch heard this, he looked at Aksy&oacute;nof,
slapped his own knee, and exclaimed, 'Well this is wonderful!
<BR>Really wonderful! But how old you've grown, Gran'dad!'

<P>The others asked him why he was so surprised, and where he had seen
Aksy&oacute;nof before; but Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch did not reply.
<BR>He only said: 'It's wonderful that we should meet here, lads!'

<P>These words made Aksy&oacute;nof wonder whether this man knew who had
killed the merchant; so he said 'Perhaps, Semy&oacute;nitch,
<BR>you have heard of that affair or maybe you've seen me before?'

<P>'How could I help hearing? The world's full of rumours. But it's long
ago, and I've forgotten what I heard.'

<P>'Perhaps you heard who killed the merchant?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof.

<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch laughed, and replied, 'It must have been
him in whose bag the knife was found! If some one else hid the
<BR>knife there, "He's not a thief till he's caught," as the saying is.
How could any one put a knife into your bag while it was under
<BR>your head? It would surely have woke you up?'

<P>When Aksy&oacute;nof heard these words, he felt sure this was the man
who had killed the merchant. He rose and went away. All
<BR>that night Aksy&oacute;nof lay awake.

<P>He felt terribly unhappy, and all sorts of images rose in his mind.
There was the image of his wife as she was when he parted
<BR>from her to go to the fair. He saw her as if she were present; her
face and her eyes rose before him; he heard her speak and
<BR>laugh. Then he saw his children, quite little, as they were at that
time: one with a little cloak on, another at his mother's breast.
<BR>And then he remembered himself as he used to be -- young and merry.
He remembered how he sat playing the guitar in the
<BR>porch of the inn where he was arrested, and how free from care he had
been. He saw, in his mind, the place where he was
<BR>flogged, the executioner, and the people standing around; the chains,
the convicts, all the twenty-six years of his prison life, and
<BR>his premature old age. The thought of it all made him so wretched that
he was ready to kill himself.

<P>'And it's all that villain's doing!' thought Aksy&oacute;nof. And his
anger was so great against Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch that he longed
for
<BR>vengeance, even if he himself should perish for it. He kept repeating
prayers all night, but could get no peace. During the day he
<BR>did not go near Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch, nor even look at him.

<P>A fortnight passed in this way. Aksy&oacute;nof could not sleep at nights,
and was so miserable that he did not know what to do.

<P>One night as he was walking about the prison he noticed some earth that
came rolling out from under one of the shelves on
<BR>which the prisoners slept. He stopped to see what it was. Suddenly
Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch crept out from under the shelf, and
<BR>looked up at Aksy&oacute;nof with frightened face. Aksy&oacute;nof
tried to pass without looking at him, but Mak&aacute;r seized his hand
and told
<BR>him that he had dug a hole under the wall, getting rid of the earth
by putting it into his high-boots, and emptying it out every day
<BR>on the road when the prisoners were driven to their work.

<P>'Just you keep quiet, old man, and you shall get out too. If you blab
they'll flog the life out of me, but I will kill you first.'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof trembled with anger as he looked at his enemy. He drew
his hand away, saying, 'I have no wish to escape, and you
<BR>have no need to kill me; you killed me long ago! As to telling of you
-- I may do so or not, as God shall direct.'

<P>Next day, when the convicts were led out to work, the convoy soldiers
noticed that one or other of the prisoners emptied some
<BR>earth out of his boots. The prison was searched, and the tunnel found.
The Governor came and questioned all the prisoners to
<BR>find out who had dug the hole. They all denied any knowledge of it.
Those who knew, would not betray Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch,
<BR>knowing he would be flogged almost to death. At last the Governor turned
to Aksy&oacute;nof, whom he knew to be a just man, and
<BR>said:

<P>'You are a truthful old man; tell me, before God, who dug the hole?'

<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch stood as if he were quite unconcerned,
looking at the Governor and not so much as glancing at Aksy&oacute;nof.
<BR>Aksy&oacute;nof's lips and hands trembled, and for a long time he could
not utter a word. He thought, 'Why should I screen him who
<BR>ruined my life? Let him pay for what I have suffered. But if I tell,
they will probably flog the life out of him and maybe I suspect
<BR>him wrongly. And, after all, what good would it be to me?'

<P>'Well, old man,' repeated the Governor, 'tell us the truth: who has
been digging under the wall?'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof glanced at Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch, and said
'I cannot say, your honour. It is not God's will that I should tell! Do
what
<BR>you like with me; I am in your hands.'

<P>However much the Governor tried, Aksy&oacute;nof would say no more,
and so the matter had to be left.

<P>That night, when Aksy&oacute;nof was lying on his bed and just beginning
to doze, some one came quietly and sat down on his bed.
<BR>He peered through the darkness and recognized Mak&aacute;r.

<P>'What more do you want of me?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof. 'Why have you
come here?'

<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch was silent. So Aksy&oacute;nof sat up
and said, 'What do you want? Go away, or I will call the guard!'

<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch bent close over Aksy&oacute;nof, and
whispered, 'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, forgive me!'

<P>'What for?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof.

<P>'It was I who killed the merchant and hid the knife among your things.
I meant to kill you too, but I heard a noise outside; so I
<BR>hid the knife in your bag and escaped out of the window.'

<P>Aksy&oacute;nof was silent, and did not know what to say. Mak&aacute;r
Semy&oacute;nitch slid off the bed-shelf and knelt upon the ground. 'Iv&aacute;n
<BR>Dm&iacute;tritch,' said he, 'forgive me! For the love of God, forgive
me! I will confess that it was I who killed the merchant, and you
<BR>will be released and can go to your home.'

<P>'It is easy for you to talk,' said Aksy&oacute;nof, 'but I have suffered
for you these twenty-six years. Where could I go to now? . . .
<BR>My wife is dead, and my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere
to go. . . .'

<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch did not rise, but beat his head on the
floor. 'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, forgive me!' he cried. 'When they
flogged me
<BR>with the knout it was not so hard to bear as it is to see you now .
. . yet you had pity on me, and did not tell. For Christ's sake
<BR>forgive me, wretch that I am!' And he began to sob.

<P>When Aksy&oacute;nof heard him sobbing he, too, began to weep.

<P>'God will forgive you!' said he. 'Maybe I am a hundred times worse than
you.' And at these words his heart grew light, and the
<BR>longing for home left him. He no longer had any desire to leave the
prison, but only hoped for his last hour to come.

<P>In spite of what Aksy&oacute;nof had said, Maker Semy&oacute;nitch confessed
his guilt. But when the order for his release came, Aksy&oacute;nof
<BR>was already dead.
