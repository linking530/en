<P><B>(TOLSTOY'S ADAPTATION OF A STORY BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT. )</B>

<P>NEAR the borders of France and Italy, on the shore of the Mediterranean
Sea, lies a tiny little kingdom called Monaco. Many a
<BR>small country town can boast more inhabitants than this kingdom, for
there are only about seven thousand of them all told, and if all
<BR>the land in the kingdom were divided there would not be an acre for
each inhabitant. But in this toy kingdom there is a real kinglet;
<BR>and he has a palace, and courtiers, and ministers, and a bishop, and
generals, and an army.

<P>It is not a large army, only sixty men in all, but still it is an army.
There were also taxes in this kingdom as elsewhere: a tax on
<BR>tobacco, and on wine and spirits and a poll-tax. But though the people
there drink and smoke as people do in other countries, there
<BR>are so few of them that the King would have been hard put to it to
feed his courtiers and officials and to keep himself, if he had
<BR>not found a new and special source of revenue. This special revenue
comes from a gaming house, where people play roulette.
<BR>People play, and whether they win or lose the keeper always gets a
percentage on the turnover; and out of his profits he pays a
<BR>large sum to the King. The reason he pays so much is that it is the
only such gambling establishment left in Europe. Some of the
<BR>little German Sovereigns used to keep gaming houses of the same kind,
but some years ago they were forbidden to do so. The
<BR>reason they were stopped was because these gaming houses did so much
harm. A man would come and try his luck, then he
<BR>would risk all he had and lose it, then he would even risk money that
did not belong to him and lose that too, and then, in despair, he
<BR>would drown or shoot himself. So the Germans forbade their rulers to
make money in this way; but there was no one to stop the
<BR>King of Monaco, and he remained with a monopoly of the business.

<P>So now every one who wants to gamble goes to Monaco. Whether they win
or lose, the King gains by it. 'You can't earn stone
<BR>palaces by honest labour,' as the proverb says; and the Kinglet of
Monaco knows it is a dirty business, but what is he to do? He
<BR>has to live; and to draw a revenue from drink and from tobacco is also
not a nice thing. So he lives and reigns, and rakes in the
<BR>money, and holds his court with all the ceremony of a real king.

<P>He has his coronation, his levees; he rewards, sentences, and pardons,
and he also has his reviews, councils, laws, and courts of
<BR>justice: just like other kings, only all on a smaller scale.

<P>Now it happened a few years ago that a murder was committed in this
toy King's domains. The people of that kingdom are
<BR>peaceable, and such a thing had not happened before. The judges assembled
with much ceremony and tried the case in the most
<BR>judicial manner. There were judges, and prosecutors, and jurymen, and
barristers. They argued and judged, and at last they
<BR>condemned the criminal to have his head cut off as the law directs.
So far so good. Next they submitted the sentence to the King.
<BR>The King read the sentence and confirmed it. 'If the fellow must be
executed, execute him.'

<P>There was only one hitch in the matter; and that was that they had neither
a guillotine for cutting heads off, nor an executioner.
<BR>The Ministers considered the matter, and decided to address an inquiry
to the French Government, asking whether the French
<BR>could not lend them a machine and an expert to cut off the criminal's
head; and if so, would the French kindly inform them what
<BR>the cost would be. The letter was sent. A week later the reply came:
a machine and an expert could be supplied, and the cost
<BR>would be 16,000 francs. This was laid before the King. He thought it
over. Sixteen thousand francs! 'The wretch is not worth the
<BR>money,' said he. 'Can't it be done, somehow, cheaper? Why 16,000 francs
is more than two francs a head on the whole population.
<BR>The people won't stand it, and it may cause a riot!'

<P>So a Council was called to consider what could be done; and it was decided
to send a similar inquiry to the King of Italy. The
<BR>French Government is republican, and has no proper respect for kings;
but the King of Italy was a brother monarch, and might be
<BR>induced to do the thing cheaper. So the letter was written, and a prompt
reply was received.

<P>The Italian Government wrote that they would have pleasure in supplying
both a machine and an expert; and the whole cost would
<BR>be 12,000 francs, including travelling expenses. This was cheaper,
but still it seemed too much. The rascal was really not worth the
<BR>money. It would still mean nearly two francs more per head on the taxes.
Another Council was called. They discussed and
<BR>considered how it could be done with less expense. Could not one of
the soldiers perhaps be got to do it in a rough and homely
<BR>fashion? The General was called and was asked: 'Can't you find us a
soldier who would cut the man's head off? In war they don't
<BR>mind killing people. In fact, that is what they are trained for.' So
the General talked it over with the soldiers to see whether one of
<BR>them would not undertake the job. But none of the soldiers would do
it. 'No,' they said, 'we don't know how to do it; it is not a thing
<BR>we have been taught.'

<P>What was to be done? Again the Ministers considered and reconsidered.
They assembled a Commission, and a Committee, and a
<BR>Sub-Committee, and at last they decided that the best thing would be
to alter the death sentence to one of imprisonment for life.
<BR>This would enable the King to show his mercy, and it would come cheaper.

<P>The King agreed to this, and so the matter was arranged. The only hitch
now was that there was no suitable prison for a man
<BR>sentenced for life. There was a small lock-up where people were sometimes
kept temporarily, but there was no strong prison fit
<BR>for permanent use. However, they managed to find a place that would
do, and they put the young fellow there and placed a guard
<BR>over him. The guard had to watch the criminal, and had also to fetch
his food from the palace kitchen.

<P>The prisoner remained there month after month till a year had passed.
But when a year had passed, the Kinglet, looking over the
<BR>account of his income and expenditure one day, noticed a new item of
expenditure. This was for the keep of the criminal; nor was
<BR>it a small item either. There was a special guard, and there was also
the man's food. It came to more than 600 francs a year. And
<BR>the worst of it was that the fellow was still young and healthy, and
might live for fifty years. When one came to reckon it up, the
<BR>matter was serious. It would never do. So the King summoned his Ministers
and said to them:

<P>'You must find some cheaper way of dealing with this rascal. The present
plan is too expensive.' And the Ministers met and
<BR>considered and reconsidered, till one of them said: 'Gentlemen, in
my opinion we must dismiss the guard.' 'But then,' rejoined
<BR>another Minister, 'the fellow will run away.' 'Well,' said the first
speaker, 'let him run away, and be hanged to him!' So they
<BR>reported the result of their deliberations to the Kinglet, and he agreed
with them. The guard was dismissed, and they waited to see
<BR>what would happen. All that happened was that at dinner-time the criminal
came out, and, not finding his guard, he went to the
<BR>King's kitchen to fetch his own dinner. He took what was given him,
returned to the prison, shut the door on himself, and stayed
<BR>inside. Next day the same thing occurred. He went for his food at the
proper time; but as for running away, he did not show the
<BR>least sign of it! What was to be done? They considered the matter again.

<P>'We shall have to tell him straight out,' said they 'that we do not
want to keep him.' So the Minister of Justice had him brought
<BR>before him.

<P>'Why do you not run away?' said the Minister. 'There is no guard to
keep you. You can go where you like, and the King will not
<BR>mind.'

<P>'I daresay the King would not mind,' replied the man, 'but I have nowhere
to go. What can I do? You have ruined my character by
<BR>your sentence, and people will turn their backs on me. Besides, I have
got out of the way of working. You have treated me badly.
<BR>It is not fair. In the first place, when once you sentenced me to death
you ought to have executed me; but you did not do it. That is
<BR>one thing. I did not complain about that. Then you sentenced me to
imprisonment for life and put a guard to bring me my food; but
<BR>after a time you took him away again and I had to fetch my own food.
Again I did not complain. But now you actually want me to
<BR>go away! I can't agree to that. You may do as you like, but I won't
go away!'

<P>What was to be done? Once more the Council was summoned. What course
could they adopt? The man would not go. They
<BR>reflected and considered. The only way to get rid of him was to offer
him a pension. And so they reported to the King. 'There is
<BR>nothing else for it,' said they; 'we must get rid of him somehow.'
The sum fixed was 600 francs, and this was announced to the
<BR>prisoner.

<P>'Well,' said he, 'I don't mind, so long as you undertake to pay it regularly.
On that condition I am willing to go.'

<P>So the matter was settled. He received one-third of his annuity in advance,
and left the King's dominions. It was only a quarter of
<BR>an hour by rail; and he emigrated, and settled just across the frontier,
where he bought a bit of land, started market-gardening, and
<BR>now lives comfortably. He always goes at the proper time to draw his
pension. Having received it, he goes to the gaming tables,
<BR>stakes two or three francs, sometimes wins and sometimes loses, and
then returns home. He lives peaceably and well.

<P>It is a good thing that he did not commit his crime in a country where
they do not grudge expense to cut a man's head off, or to
<BR>keeping him in prison for life.
