<P>THIS volume is divided into seven parts.

<P>First we have Tales for Children, published about the year 1872, and
reminding us of the time when Tolstoy was absorbed in
<BR>efforts to educate the peasant children. This section of the book contains
the two stories which of all that he has written Tolstoy
<BR>likes best. In What is Art? he claims no place among examples of good
art for any of his own productions 'except for the story
<BR>God sees the Truth, but Waits, which seeks a place in the first class
(religious art), and A Prisoner in the Caucasus, which
<BR>belongs to the second (universal art).' In the first of these the subject
(a favourite one with Tolstoy) is the forgiveness of injuries.
<BR>The second deals with the simplest feelings common to all men: fear
and courage, pity, endurance, &amp;c.' expressed with that
<BR>individuality, clearness, and sincerity, which Tolstoy says are the
signs of true art.

<P>Part II contains a series of stories written for the people; and among
them What Men Live By, probably the most widely
<BR>circulated of all Tolstoy's tales. It is founded on the oft-repeated
legend of an angel sent by God to live for a while among men.

<P>Part III consists of a Fairy Tale, Iv&aacute;n the Fool, which contains
in popular form Tolstoy's indictment of militarism and
<BR>commercialism.

<P>Part IV contains three short stories written to help the sale of cheap
reproductions of some good drawings; Tolstoy having for
<BR>many years been anxious by all means in his power to further the circulation,
at a cheap price, of good works of pictorial as
<BR>well as literary art.

<P>In Part V we have a series of Russian Folk-Tales. The gems of this collection
are the temperance story, The Imp and the
<BR>Crust, the anti-war story, The Empty Drum, and another story, How Much
Land does a Man Need? which deals with a
<BR>peasant's greed for land. A Grain as big as a Hen's Egg and The Godson
are highly characteristic of the spirit of the Russian
<BR>peasantry, and supply a glimpse of the sources from whence Tolstoy
imbibed many of his own spiritual sympathies and
<BR>antipathies.

<P>Part VI gives two adaptations from the French which have appeared in
no previous English edition of Tolstoy's works. They
<BR>are not merely translations, for to some extent Tolstoy when translating
them, modified them and made them his own.

<P>Part VII consists of stories Tolstoy contributed in aid of the Jews
left destitute after the massacres and outrages in Kishin&eacute;f and
<BR>elsewhere in Russia in 1903, -- outrages which were forerunners of
the yet more terrible Jewish massacres of 1905.

<P>The importance Tolstoy attributes to literature of the kind contained
in this volume, is shown by the following passage in What is
<BR>Art? --

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The artist of the future will understand that
to compose a fairy tale, a little song which will touch a lullaby
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a riddle which will entertain, a jest which
will amuse, or to draw a sketch such as will delight dozens of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generations or millions of children and adults,
is incomparably more important and more fruitful than to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compose a novel, or a symphony, or paint a
picture, of the kind which diverts some members of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wealthy classes for a short time and is then
for ever forgotten. The region of this art of the simplest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feelings accessible to all is enormous, and
it is as yet almost untouched.'

<P>The sections of the book have been arranged in chronological order.
The date when each story was published is given. The
<BR>translations are new ones, and for the footnotes I am responsible.
