<P>THERE lived in olden times a good and kindly man. He had this world's
goods in abundance, and many slaves to serve him. And
<BR>the slaves prided themselves on their master, saying:

<P>'There is no better lord than ours under the sun. He feeds and clothes
us well, and gives us work suited to our strength. He bears
<BR>no malice and never speaks a harsh word to any one. He is not like
other masters, who treat their slaves worse than cattle:
<BR>punishing them whether they deserve it or not, and never giving them
a friendly word. He wishes us well, does good, and speaks
<BR>kindly to us. We do not wish for a better life.'

<P>Thus the slaves praised their lord, and the Devil, seeing it, was vexed
that slaves should live in such love and harmony with their
<BR>master. So getting one of them, whose name was Aleb, into his power,
the Devil ordered him to tempt the other slaves. And one
<BR>day, when they were all sitting together resting and talking of their
master's goodness, Aleb raised his voice, and said:

<P>'It is stupid to make so much of our master's goodness. The Devil himself
would be kind to you, if you did what he wanted. We
<BR>serve our master well, and humour him in all things. As soon as he
thinks of anything, we do it: foreseeing all his wishes. What can
<BR>he do but be kind to us? Just try how it will be if, instead of humouring
him, we do him some harm instead. He will act like any one
<BR>else, and will repay evil for evil, as the worst of masters do.

<P>The other slaves began denying what Aleb had said and at last bet with
him. Aleb undertook to make their master angry. If he
<BR>failed, he was to lose his holiday garment; but if he succeeded, the
other slaves were to give him theirs. Moreover, they promised
<BR>to defend him against the master, and to set him free if he should
be put in chains or imprisoned. Having arranged this bet, Aleb
<BR>agreed to make his master angry next morning.

<P>Aleb was a shepherd, and had in his charge a number of valuable, pure-bred
sheep, of which his master was very fond. Next
<BR>morning, when the master brought some visitors into the inclosure to
show them the valuable sheep, Aleb winked at his
<BR>companions, as if to say:

<P>'See, now, how angry I will make him.'

<P>All the other slaves assembled, looking in at the gates or over the
fence, and the Devil climbed a tree near by to see how his
<BR>servant would do his work. The master walked about the inclosure, showing
his guests the ewes and lambs, and presently he
<BR>wished to show them his finest ram.

<P>'All the rams are valuable,' said he, 'but I have one with closely twisted
horns, which is priceless. I prize him as the apple of my
<BR>eye.'

<P>Startled by the strangers, the sheep rushed about the inclosure, so
that the visitors could not get a good look at the ram. As soon as
<BR>it stood still, Aleb startled the sheep as if by accident, and they
all got mixed up again. The visitors could not make out which was
<BR>the priceless ram. At last the master got tired of it.

<P>'Aleb, dear friend,' he said, 'pray catch our best ram for me, the one
with the tightly twisted horns. Catch him very carefully, and
<BR>hold him still for a moment.'

<P>Scarcely had the master said this, when Aleb rushed in among the sheep
like a lion, and clutched the priceless ram. Holding him
<BR>fast by the wool, he seized the left hind leg with one hand, and, before
his master's eyes, lifted it and jerked it so that it snapped
<BR>like a dry branch. He had broken the ram's leg and it fell bleating
on to its knees. Then Aleb seized the right hind leg, while the left
<BR>twisted round and hung quite limp. The visitors and the slaves exclaimed
in dismay, and the Devil, sitting up in the tree, rejoiced
<BR>that Aleb had done his task so cleverly. The master looked as black
as thunder, frowned, bent his head, and did not say a word.
<BR>The visitors and the slaves were silent, too, waiting to see what would
follow. After remaining silent for a while, the master shook
<BR>himself as if to throw off some burden. Then he lifted his head, and
raising his eyes heavenward, remained so for a short time.
<BR>Presently the wrinkles passed from his face, and he looked down at
Aleb with a smile saying:

<P>'Oh, Aleb, Aleb! Your master bade you anger me; but my master is stronger
than yours. I am not angry with you, but I will make
<BR>your master angry. You are afraid that I shall punish you, and you
have been wishing for your freedom. Know, then, Aleb, that I
<BR>shall not punish you; but, as you wish to be free, here, before my
guests, I set you free. Go where you like, and take your holiday
<BR>garment with you!'

<P>And the kind master returned with his guests to the house; but the Devil,
grinding his teeth, fell down from the tree, and sank
<BR>through the ground.
