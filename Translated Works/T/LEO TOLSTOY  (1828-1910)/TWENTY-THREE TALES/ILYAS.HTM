<P>THERE once lived, in the Government of Ouf&aacute; a Bashk&iacute;r
named Ily&aacute;s. His father, who died a year after he had found his
son a
<BR>wife, did not leave him much property. Ily&aacute;s then had only seven
mares, two cows, and about a score of sheep. He was a good
<BR>manager, however, and soon began to acquire more. He and his wife worked
from morn till night; rising earlier than others and
<BR>going later to bed; and his possessions increased year by year. Living
in this way, Ily&aacute;s little by little acquired great wealth. At the
<BR>end of thirty-five years he had 200 horses, 150 head of cattle, and
1,200 sheep. Hired labourers tended his flocks and herds, and
<BR>hired women milked his mares and cows, and made kumiss[17], butter
and cheese. Ily&aacute;s had abundance of everything, and every
<BR>one in the district envied him. They said of him:

<P>'Ily&aacute;s is a fortunate man: he has plenty of everything. This
world must be a pleasant place for him.'

<P>People of position heard of Ily&aacute;s and sought his acquaintance.
Visitors came to him from afar; and he welcomed every one, and
<BR>gave them food and drink. Whoever might come, there was always kumiss,
tea, sherbet, and mutton to set before them. Whenever
<BR>visitors arrived a sheep would be killed, or sometimes two; and if
many guests came he would even slaughter a mare for them.

<P>Ily&aacute;s had three children: two sons and a daughter; and he married
them all off. While he was poor, his sons worked with him, and
<BR>looked after the flocks and herds themselves; but when he grew rich
they got spoiled and one of them took to drink. The eldest
<BR>was killed in a brawl; and the younger, who had married a self-willed
woman, ceased to obey his father, and they could not live
<BR>together any more.

<P>So they parted, and Ily&aacute;s gave his son a house and some of the
cattle; and this diminished his wealth. Soon after that, a disease
<BR>broke out among Ily&aacute;s's sheep, and many died. Then followed
a bad harvest, and the hay crop failed; and many cattle died that
<BR>winter. Then the Kirgh&iacute;z captured his best herd of horses; and
Ily&aacute;s's property dwindled away. It became smaller and smaller,
<BR>while at the same time his strength grew less; till, by the time he
was seventy years old, he had begun to sell his furs, carpets,
<BR>saddles, and tents. At last he had to part with his remaining cattle,
and found himself face to face with want. Before he knew how
<BR>it had happened, he had lost everything, and in their old age he and
his wife had to go into service. Ily&aacute;s had nothing left, except
<BR>the clothes on his back, a fur cloak, a cup, his indoor shoes and overshoes,
and his wife, Sham-Shemagi, who also was old by this
<BR>time. The son who had parted from him had gone into a far country,
and his daughter was dead, so that there was no one to help
<BR>the old couple.

<P>Their neighbour, Muhammad-Shah, took pity on them. Muhammad-Shah was
neither rich nor poor, but lived comfortably, and was
<BR>a good man. He remembered Ily&aacute;s's hospitality, and pitying him,
said:

<P>'Come and live with me, Ily&aacute;s, you and your old woman. In summer
you can work in my melon-garden as much as your strength
<BR>allows, and in winter feed my cattle; and Sham-Shemagi shall milk my
mares and make kumiss. I will feed and clothe you both.
<BR>When you need anything, tell me, and you shall have it.'

<P>Ily&aacute;s thanked his neighbour, and he and his wife took service
with Muhammad-Shah as labourers. At first the position seemed
<BR>hard to them, but they got used to it, and lived on, working as much
as their strength allowed.

<P>Muhammad-Shah found it was to his advantage to keep such people, because,
having been masters themselves, they knew how to
<BR>manage and were not lazy, but did all the work they could. Yet it grieved
Muhammad-Shah to see people brought so low who had
<BR>been of such high standing.

<P>It happened once that some of Muhammad-Shah's relatives came from a
great distance to visit him, and a Mullah came too.
<BR>Muhammad-Shah told Ily&aacute;s to catch a sheep and kill it. Ily&aacute;s
skinned the sheep, and boiled it, and sent it in to the guests. The
<BR>guests ate the mutton, had some tea, and then began drinking kumiss.
As they were sitting with their host on down cushions on a
<BR>carpet, conversing and sipping kumiss from their cups, Ily&aacute;s,
having finished his work passed by the open door. Muhammad-Shah,
<BR>seeing him pass, said to one of the guests:

<P>'Did you notice that old man who passed just now?'

<P>'Yes,' said the visitor, 'what is there remarkable about him?'

<P>'Only this -- that he was once the richest man among us,' replied the
host. 'His name is Ily&aacute;s. You may have heard of him.'

<P>'Of course I have heard of him,' the guest answered 'I never saw him
before, but his fame has spread far and wide.'

<P>'Yes, and now he has nothing left,' said Muhammad-Shah, 'and he lives
with me as my labourer, and his old woman is here too --
<BR>she milks the mares.'

<P>The guest was astonished: he clicked with his tongue, shook his head,
and said:

<P>'Fortune turns like a wheel. One man it lifts, another it sets down!
Does not the old man grieve over all he has lost?'

<P>'Who can tell. He lives quietly and peacefully, and works well.'

<P>'May I speak to him?' asked the guest. 'I should like to ask him about
his life.'

<P>'Why not?' replied the master, and he called from the kib&iacute;tka[18]
in which they were sitting:

<P>'Babay;' (which in the Bashkir tongue means 'Grandfather ') 'come in
and have a cup of kumiss with us, and call your wife here
<BR>also.'

<P>Ily&aacute;s entered with his wife; and after exchanging greetings with
his master and the guests, he repeated a prayer, and seated
<BR>himself near the door. His wife passed in behind the curtain and sat
down with her mistress.

<P>A Cap of kumiss was handed to Ily&aacute;s; he wished the guests and
his master good health, bowed, drank a little, and put down the
<BR>cup.

<P>'Well, Daddy,' said the guest who had wished to speak to him, 'I suppose
you feel rather sad at the sight of us. It must remind you
<BR>of your former prosperity, and of your present sorrows.'

<P>Ily&aacute;s smiled, and said:

<P>'If I were to tell you what is happiness and what is misfortune, you
would not believe me. You had better ask my wife. She is a
<BR>woman, and what is in her heart is on her tongue. She will tell you
the whole truth.'

<P>The guest turned towards the curtain.

<P>'Well, Granny,' he cried, 'tell me how your former happiness compares
with your present misfortune.'

<P>And Sham-Shemagi answered from behind the curtain:

<P>'This is what I think about it: My old man and I lived for fifty years
seeking happiness and not finding it; and it is only now, these
<BR>last two years, since we had nothing left and have lived as labourers,
that we have found real happiness, and we wish for nothing
<BR>better than our present lot.'

<P>The guests were astonished, and so was the master; he even rose and
drew the curtain back, so as to see the old woman's face.
<BR>There she stood with her arms folded, looking at her old husband, and
smiling; and he smiled back at her. The old woman went on:

<P>'I speak the truth and do not jest. For half a century we sought for
happiness, and as long as we were rich we never found it. Now
<BR>that we have nothing left, and have taken service as labourers, we
have found such happiness that we want nothing better.'

<P>'But in what does your happiness consist?' asked the guest.

<P>'Why, in this,' she replied, 'when we were rich my husband and I had
so many cares that we had no time to talk to one another, or
<BR>to think of our souls, or to pray to God. Now we had visitors, and
had to consider what food to set before them, and what presents
<BR>to give them, lest they should speak ill of us. When they left, we
had to look after our labourers who were always trying to shirk
<BR>work and get the best food, while we wanted to get all we could out
of them. So we sinned. Then we were in fear lest a wolf
<BR>should kill a foal or a calf, or thieves steal our horses. We lay awake
at night, worrying lest the ewes should overlie their lambs,
<BR>and we got up again and again to see that all was well. One thing attended
to, another care would spring up: how, for instance, to
<BR>get enough fodder for the winter. And besides that, my old man and
I used to disagree. He would say we must do so and so, and I
<BR>would differ from him; and then we disputed -- sinning again. So we
passed from one trouble to another, from one sin to another,
<BR>and found no happiness.'

<P>'Well, and now?'

<P>'Now, when my husband and I wake in the morning, we always have a loving
word for one another and we live peacefully, having
<BR>nothing to quarrel about. We have no care but how best to serve our
master. We work as much as our strength allows and do it
<BR>with a will, that our master may not lose but profit by us. When we
come in, dinner or supper is ready and there is kumiss to drink.
<BR>We have fuel to burn when it is cold and we have our fur cloak. And
we have time to talk, time to think of our souls, and time to
<BR>pray. For fifty years we sought happiness, but only now at last have
we found it.'

<P>The guests laughed.

<P>But Ily&aacute;s said:

<P>'Do not laugh, friends. It is not a matter for jesting -- it is the
truth of life. We also were foolish at first, and wept at the loss of our
<BR>wealth; but now God has shown us the truth, and we tell it, not for
our own consolation, but for your good.'

<P>And the Mullah said:

<P>'That is a wise speech. Ily&aacute;s has spoken the exact truth. The
same is said in Holy Writ.'

<P>And the guests ceased laughing and became thoughtful.
