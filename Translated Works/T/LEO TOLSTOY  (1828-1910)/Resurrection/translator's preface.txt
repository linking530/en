TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE



Opinions about Tolstoy and his work differ, but on one point

there surely might be unanimity. A writer of world-wide

reputation should be at least allowed to know how to spell his

own name. Why should any one insist on spelling it "Tolstoi"

(with one, two or three dots over the "i"), when he himself

writes it "Tolstoy"? The only reason I have ever heard suggested

is, that in England and America such outlandish views are

attributed to him, that an outlandish spelling is desirable to

match those views.



This novel, written in the rough by Tolstoy some years ago and

founded upon an actual occurrence, was completely rewritten by

him during the last year and a half, and all the proceeds have

been devoted by him to aiding the Doukhobors, a sect who were

persecuted in the Caucasus (especially from 1895 to 1898) for

refusing to learn war. About seven thousand three hundred of them

are settled in Canada, and about a hundred of the leaders are

exiled to the remote parts of Siberia.



Anything I may receive for my work in translating the book will

go to the same cause. "Prevention is better than cure," and I

would rather help people to abstain from killing and wounding

each other than devote the money to patch up their wounds after

the battle.
