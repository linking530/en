               The Whispering Gallery



  WHEN at last I came back to a sense of life and being, my face was

wet, but wet, as I soon knew, with tears. How long this state of

insensibility lasted, it is quite impossible for me now to say. I

had no means left to me of taking any account of time. Never since the

creation of the world had such a solitude as mine existed. I was

completely abandoned.

  After my fall I lost much blood. I felt myself flooded with the

life-giving liquid. My first sensation was perhaps a natural one.

Why was I not dead? Because I was alive, there was something left to

do. I tried to make up my mind to think no longer. As far as I was

able, I drove away all ideas, and utterly overcome by pain and

grief, I crouched against the granite wall.

  I just commenced to feel the fainting coming on again, and the

sensation that this was the last struggle before complete

annihilation- when, on a sudden, a violent uproar reached my ears.

It had some resemblance to the prolonged rumbling voice of thunder,

and I clearly distinguished sonorous voices, lost one after the other,

in the distant depths of the gulf.

  Whence came this noise? Naturally, it was to be supposed from new

phenomena which were taking place in the bosom of the solid mass of

Mother Earth! The explosion of some gaseous vapors, or the fall of

some solid, of the granitic or other rock.

  Again I listened with deep attention. I was extremely anxious to

hear if this strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be

renewed! A whole quarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation.

Deep and solemn silence reigned in the tunnel. So still that I could

hear the beatings of my own heart! I waited, waited with a strange

kind of hopefulness.

  Suddenly my ear, which leaned accidentally against the wall,

appeared to catch, as it were, the faintest echo of a sound. I thought

that I heard vague, incoherent and distant voices. I quivered all over

with excitement and hope!

  "It must be hallucination," I cried. "It cannot be! it is not true!"

  But no! By listening more attentively, I really did convince

myself that what I heard was truly the sound of human voices. To

make any meaning out of the sound, however, was beyond my power. I was

too weak even to hear distinctly. Still it was a positive fact that

someone was speaking. Of that I was quite certain.

  There was a moment of fear. A dread fell upon my soul that it

might be my own words brought back to me by a distant echo. Perhaps

without knowing it, I might have been crying aloud. I resolutely

closed my lips, and once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall.

  Yes, for certain. It was in truth the sound of human voices.

  I now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along

the sides of the cavern, until I reached a point where I could hear

more distinctly. But though I could detect the sound, I could only

make out uncertain, strange, and incomprehensible words. They

reached my ear as if they had been spoken in a low tone- murmured,

as it were, afar off.

  At last, I made out the word forlorad repeated several times in a

tone betokening great mental anguish and sorrow.

  What could this word mean, and who was speaking it? It must be

either my uncle or the guide Hans! If, therefore, I could hear them,

they must surely be able to hear me.

  "Help," I cried at the top of my voice; "help, I am dying!"

  I then listened with scarcely a breath; I panted for the slightest

sound in the darkness- a cry, a sigh, a question! But silence

reigned supreme. No answer came! In this way some minutes passed. A

whole flood of ideas flashed through my mind. I began to fear that

my voice, weakened by sickness and suffering, could not reach my

companions who were in search of me.

  "It must be they," I cried; "who else could by any possibility be

buried a hundred miles below the level of the earth?" The mere

supposition was preposterous.

  I began, therefore, to listen again with the most breathless

attention. As I moved my ears along the side of the place I was in,

I found a mathematical point as it were, where the voices appeared

to attain their maximum of intensity. The word forlorad again

distinctly reached my ear. Then came again that rolling noise like

thunder which had awakened me out of torpor.

  "I begin to understand," I said to myself after some little time

devoted to reflection; "it is not through the solid mass that the

sound reaches my ears. The walls of my cavernous retreat are of

solid granite, and the most fearful explosion would not make uproar

enough to penetrate them. The sound must come along the gallery

itself. The place I was in must possess some peculiar acoustic

properties of its own."

  Again I listened; and this time- yes, this time- I heard my name

distinctly pronounced: cast as it were into space.

  It was my uncle, the Professor, who was speaking. He was in

conversation with the guide, and the word which had so often reached

my ears, forlorad, was a Danish expression.

  Then I understood it all. In order to make myself heard, I too

must speak as it were along the side of the gallery, which would carry

the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from

point to point.

  But there was no time to lose. If my companions were only to

remove a few feet from where they stood, the acoustic effect would

be over, my Whispering Gallery would be destroyed. I again therefore

crawled towards the wall, and said as clearly and distinctly as I

could:

  "Uncle Hardwigg."

  I then awaited a reply.

  Sound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme

rapidity. Besides the density of the air at that depth from light

and motion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation.

Several seconds elapsed, which to my excited imagination, appeared

ages; and these words reached my eager ears, and moved my wildly

beating heart:

  "Harry, my boy, is that you?"

  A short delay between question and answer.

  "Yes- yes."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Where are you?"

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Lost!"

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "And your lamp?"

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Out."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "But the guiding stream?"

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Is lost!"

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Keep your courage, Harry. We will do our best."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "One moment, my uncle," I cried; "I have no longer strength to

answer your questions. But- for heaven's sake- do you- continue- to

speak- to me!" Absolute silence, I felt, would be annihilation.

  "Keep up your courage," said my uncle. "As you are so weak, do not

speak. We have been searching for you in all directions, both by going

upwards and downwards in the gallery. My dear boy, I had begun to give

over all hope- and you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow

and regret I have shed. At last, supposing you to be still on the road

beside the Hansbach, we again descended, firing off guns as signals.

Now, however, that we have found you, and that our voices reach each

other, it may be a long time before we actually meet. We are

conversing by means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of

the labyrinth. But do not despair, my dear boy. It is something gained

even to hear each other."

  While he was speaking, my brain was at work reflecting. A certain

undefined hope, vague and shapeless as yet, made my heart beat wildly.

In the first place, it was absolutely necessary for me to know one

thing. I once more, therefore, leaned my head against the wall,

which I almost touched with my lips, and again spoke.

  "Uncle."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "My boy?" was his answer after a few moments.

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "It is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we

are asunder."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "That is not difficult."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "You have your chronometer at hand?" I asked.

  . . . . . . . . . .


  "Certainly."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Well, take it into your hand. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the

second at which you speak. I will reply as soon as I hear your

words-and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply

reaches you."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Very good; and the mean time between my question and your answer

will be the time occupied by my voice in reaching you."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "That is exactly what I mean, Uncle," was my eager reply.

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Are you ready?"

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Yes."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Well, make ready, I am about to pronounce your name," said the

Professor.

  I applied my ear close to the sides of the cavernous gallery, and as

soon as the word "Harry" reached my ear, I turned round and, placing

my lips to the wall, repeated the sound.

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Forty seconds," said my uncle. "There has elapsed forty seconds

between the two words. The sound, therefore, takes twenty seconds to

ascend. Now, allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every second-

we have twenty thousand four hundred feet- a league and a half and

one-eighth."

  These words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell.

  "A league and a half," I muttered in a low and despairing voice.

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "It shall be got over, my boy," cried my uncle in a cheery tone;

"depend on us."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "But do you know whether to ascend or descend?" I asked faintly

enough.

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "We have to descend, and I will tell you why. You have reached a

vast open space, a kind of bare crossroad, from which galleries

diverge in every direction. That in which you are now lying must

necessarily bring you to this point, for it appears that all these

mighty fissures, these fractures of the globe's interior, radiate from

the vast cavern which we at this moment occupy. Rouse yourself,

then, have courage and continue your route. Walk if you can, if not

drag yourself along- slide, if nothing else is possible. The slope

must be rather rapid- and you will find strong arms to receive you

at the end of your journey. Make a start, like a good fellow."

  These words served to rouse some kind of courage in my sinking

frame.

  "Farewell for the present, good uncle, I am about to take my

departure. As soon as I start, our voices will cease to commingle.

Farewell, then, until we meet again."

  . . . . . . . . . .

  "Adieu, Harry- until we say Welcome." Such were the last words which

reached my anxious ears before I commenced my weary and almost

hopeless journey.

  This wonderful and surprising conversation which took place

through the vast mass of the earth's labyrinth, these words exchanged,

the speakers being about five miles apart- ended with hopeful and

pleasant expressions. I breathed one more prayer to Heaven, I sent

up words of thanksgiving- believing in my inmost heart that He had led

me to the only place where the voices of my friends could reach my

ears.

  This apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by

simple natural laws; it arose from the conductibility of the rock.

There are many instances of this singular propagation of sound which

are not perceptible in its less mediate positions. In the interior

gallery of St. Paul's, and amid the curious caverns in Sicily, these

phenomena are observable. The most marvelous of them all is known as

the Ear of Dionysius.

  These memories of the past, of my early reading and studies, came

fresh to my thoughts. Moreover, I began to reason that if my uncle and

I could communicate at so great a distance, no serious obstacle

could exist between us. All I had to do was to follow the direction

whence the sound had reached me; and logically putting it, I must

reach him if my strength did not fail.

  I accordingly rose to my feet. I soon found, however, that I could

not walk; that I must drag myself along. The slope as I expected was

very rapid; but I allowed myself to slip down.

  Soon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful

proportions; and menaced a fearful fall. I clutched at the sides; I

grasped at projections of rocks; I threw myself backwards. All in

vain. My weakness was so great I could do nothing to save myself.

  Suddenly earth failed me.

  I was first launched into a dark and gloomy void. I then struck

against the projecting asperities of a vertical gallery, a perfect

well. My head bounded against a pointed rock, and I lost all knowledge

of existence. As far as I was concerned, death had claimed me for

his own.
