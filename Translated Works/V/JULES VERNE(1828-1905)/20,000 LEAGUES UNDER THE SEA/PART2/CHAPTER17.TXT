FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON



How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian

had carried me there.  But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air.

My two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles.

The other unhappy men had been so long without food, that they

could not with impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were

given them.  We, on the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves;

we could draw this air freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze,

the breeze alone, that filled us with this keen enjoyment.



"Ah!" said Conseil, "how delightful this oxygen is!

Master need not fear to breathe it.  There is enough for everybody."



Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough

to frighten a shark.  Our strength soon returned, and, when I

looked round me, I saw we were alone on the platform.

The foreign seamen in the Nautilus were contented with the air

that circulated in the interior; none of them had come to drink

in the open air.



The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and

thankfulness to my two companions.  Ned and Conseil had

prolonged my life during the last hours of this long agony.

All my gratitude could not repay such devotion.



"My friends," said I, "we are bound one to the other for ever,

and I am under infinite obligations to you."



"Which I shall take advantage of," exclaimed the Canadian.



"What do you mean?" said Conseil.



"I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal Nautilus."



"Well," said Conseil, "after all this, are we going right?"



"Yes," I replied, "for we are going the way of the sun,

and here the sun is in the north."



"No doubt," said Ned Land; "but it remains to be seen whether

he will bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean,

that is, into frequented or deserted seas."



I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo

would rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts

of Asia and America at the same time.  He would thus complete

the tour round the submarine world, and return to those waters

in which the Nautilus could sail freely.  We ought, before long,

to settle this important point.  The Nautilus went at a rapid pace.

The polar circle was soon passed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn.

We were off the American point, March 31st, at seven o'clock

in the evening.  Then all our past sufferings were forgotten.

The remembrance of that imprisonment in the ice was effaced

from our minds.  We only thought of the future.  Captain Nemo did

not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the platform.

The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by

the lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the Nautilus.

Now, on that evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction,

that we were going back to the North by the Atlantic.

The next day, April 1st, when the Nautilus ascended to the surface

some minutes before noon, we sighted land to the west.

It was Terra del Fuego, which the first navigators named thus from

seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from the natives' huts.

The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance rose high mountains.

I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, that rises 2,070

yards above the level of the sea, with a very pointed summit, which,

according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or of wet weather.

At this moment the peak was clearly defined against the sky.

The Nautilus, diving again under the water, approached the coast,

which was only some few miles off.  From the glass windows in

the drawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech,

of which the open polar sea contains so many specimens, with their

sharp polished filaments; they measured about 300 yards in length--

real cables, thicker than one's thumb; and, having great tenacity,

they are often used as ropes for vessels.  Another weed known as velp,

with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral concretions,

hung at the bottom.  It served as nest and food for myriads

of crustacea and molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish.

There seals and otters had splendid repasts, eating the flesh

of fish with sea-vegetables, according to the English fashion.

Over this fertile and luxuriant ground the Nautilus passed with

great rapidity.  Towards evening it approached the Falkland group,

the rough summits of which I recognised the following day.

The depth of the sea was moderate.  On the shores our nets brought

in beautiful specimens of sea weed, and particularly a certain fucus,

the roots of which were filled with the best mussels in the world.

Geese and ducks fell by dozens on the platform, and soon took

their places in the pantry on board.



When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared

from the horizon, the Nautilus sank to between twenty

and twenty-five yards, and followed the American coast.

Captain Nemo did not show himself.  Until the 3rd of April we

did not quit the shores of Patagonia, sometimes under the ocean,

sometimes at the surface.  The Nautilus passed beyond the large

estuary formed by the Uraguay.  Its direction was northwards,

and followed the long windings of the coast of South America.

We had then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas

of Japan.  About eleven o'clock in the morning the Tropic

of Capricorn was crossed on the thirty-seventh meridian,

and we passed Cape Frio standing out to sea.  Captain Nemo,

to Ned Land's great displeasure, did not like the neighbourhood

of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we went at a giddy speed.

Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us,

and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation.



This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening

of the 9th of April we sighted the most westerly point of South

America that forms Cape San Roque.  But then the Nautilus

swerved again, and sought the lowest depth of a submarine valley

which is between this Cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast.

This valley bifurcates to the parallel of the Antilles,

and terminates at the mouth by the enormous depression of 9,000 yards.

In this place, the geological basin of the ocean forms,

as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half

miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of

the Cape Verde Islands, an other wall not less considerable,

that encloses thus all the sunk continent of the Atlantic.

The bottom of this immense valley is dotted with some mountains,

that give to these submarine places a picturesque aspect.

I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that were in the library

of the Nautilus--charts evidently due to Captain Nemo's hand,

and made after his personal observations.  For two days the desert

and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes.

The Nautilus was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which carried

it to all elevations.  But on the 11th of April it rose suddenly,

and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast estuary,

the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens

the sea-water for the distance of several leagues.
