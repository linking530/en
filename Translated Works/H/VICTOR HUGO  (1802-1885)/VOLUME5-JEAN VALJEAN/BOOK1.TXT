	BOOK FIRST.--THE WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLS



CHAPTER I



THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OF THE

FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE



The two most memorable barricades which the observer of social

maladies can name do not belong to the period in which the action

of this work is laid.  These two barricades, both of them symbols,

under two different aspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from

the earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of June, 1848,

the greatest war of the streets that history has ever beheld.



It sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary

to liberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote,

even contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths

of its anguish, of its discouragements and its destitutions,

of its fevers, of its distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances,

of its darkness, that great and despairing body, the rabble,

protests against, and that the populace wages battle against,

the people.



Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.



These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain

amount of night even in this madness, there is suicide in

this duel, and those words which are intended to be insults--

beggars, canaille, ochlocracy, populace--exhibit, alas! rather

the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer;

rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited.



For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain

and without respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which

they correspond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. 

Athens was an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland;

the populace saved Rome more than once; and the rabble followed

Jesus Christ.



There is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences

of the lower classes.



It was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt,

and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all

these miserable people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs,

when he uttered this mysterious saying:  "Fex urbis, lex orbis,"--

the dregs of the city, the law of the earth.



The exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds,

its violences contrary to all sense, directed against the principles

which are its life, its masterful deeds against the right, are its

popular coups d'etat and should be repressed.  The man of probity

sacrifices himself, and out of his very love for this crowd,

he combats it.  But how excusable he feels it even while holding

out against it!  How he venerates it even while resisting it! 

This is one of those rare moments when, while doing that which it

is one's duty to do, one feels something which disconcerts one,

and which would dissuade one from proceeding further; one persists,

it is necessary, but conscience, though satisfied, is sad, and the

accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart.



June, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, and almost

impossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. 

All the words which we have just uttered, must be discarded, when it

becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels

the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights.  It was necessary

to combat it, and this was a duty, for it attacked the republic. 

But what was June, 1848, at bottom?  A revolt of the people

against itself.



Where the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression;

may we, then, be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for a

moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have

just spoken and which characterized this insurrection.



One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other

defended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom

these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves

beneath the brilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them.



The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high,

and seven hundred feet wide.  It barred the vast opening of

the faubourg, that is to say, three streets, from angle to angle;

ravined, jagged, cut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense rent,

buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out

capes here and there, powerfully backed up by two great promontories

of houses of the faubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike

at the end of the formidable place which had seen the 14th of July. 

Nineteen barricades were ranged, one behind the other, in the depths

of the streets behind this principal barricade.  At the very sight

of it, one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg,

which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may

become a catastrophe.  Of what was that barricade made?  Of the

ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly, said some. 

Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others.  It wore the lamentable

aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin.  It might be asked: 

Who built this?  It might also be said:  Who destroyed this? 

It was the improvisation of the ebullition.  Hold! take this

door! this grating! this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this

broken brazier! this cracked pot!  Give all! cast away all! 

Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, ruin everything! 

It was the collaboration of the pavement, the block of stone,

the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane,

the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag,

and the malediction.  It was grand and it was petty.  It was the abyss

parodied on the public place by hubbub.  The mass beside the atom;

the strip of ruined wall and the broken bowl,--threatening fraternization

of every sort of rubbish.  Sisyphus had thrown his rock there

and Job his potsherd.  Terrible, in short.  It was the acropolis

of the barefooted.  Overturned carts broke the uniformity of

the slope; an immense dray was spread out there crossways, its axle

pointing heavenward, and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade;

an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force, to the very summit

of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of savagery had

wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror,

presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what

horses of the air.  This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt,

figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89,

the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire

on the 11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. 

The situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy

to figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared. 

If the ocean made dikes, it is thus that it would build. 

The fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass. 

What flood?  The crowd.  One thought one beheld hubbub petrified. 

One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there

had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. 

Was it a thicket?  Was it a bacchanalia?  Was it a fortress? 

Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. 

There was something of the cess-pool in that redoubt and something

Olympian in that confusion.  One there beheld in a pell-mell

full of despair, the rafters of roofs, bits of garret windows

with their figured paper, window sashes with their glass planted

there in the ruins awaiting the cannon, wrecks of chimneys,

cupboards, tables, benches, howling topsyturveydom, and those

thousand poverty-stricken things, the very refuse of the mendicant,

which contain at the same time fury and nothingness.  One would have

said that it was the tatters of a people, rags of wood, of iron,

of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust

it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of the broom making

of its misery its barricade.  Blocks resembling headsman's blocks,

dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets having the

form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish,

amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the

old tortures endured by the people.  The barricade Saint Antoine

converted everything into a weapon; everything that civil war could

throw at the head of society proceeded thence; it was not combat,

it was a paroxysm; the carbines which defended this redoubt,

among which there were some blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware

bones, coat-buttons, even the casters from night-stands, dangerous

projectiles on account of the brass.  This barricade was furious;

it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments,

when provoking the army, it was covered with throngs and tempest;

a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it; a swarm filled it;

it had a thorny crest of guns, of sabres, of cudgels, of axes,

of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flag flapped in the wind;

shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll of drums, the sobs

of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to

be heard there.  It was huge and living, and, like the back of an

electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. 

The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where

rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of God;

a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. 

It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.



As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of

the revolution--what?  The revolution.  It--that barricade,

chance, hazard, disorder, terror, misunderstanding, the unknown--

had facing it the Constituent Assembly, the sovereignty

of the people, universal suffrage, the nation, the republic;

and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the Marseillaise.



Immense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.



The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance.  The faubourg

shouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover

of the faubourg.  The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against

which the strategy of the African generals dashed itself.  Its caverns,

its excrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, so to speak,

and grinned beneath the smoke.  The mitraille vanished in shapelessness;

the bombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes

in it; what was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments,

accustomed to the fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes

on that species of redoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling

and a mountain by its enormous size.



A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple

which debouches on the boulevard near the Chateaud'Eau, if one

thrust one's head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the

Dallemagne shop, one perceived in the distance, beyond the canal,

in the street which mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating

point of the rise, a strange wall reaching to the second story of

the house fronts, a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right

and the houses on the left, as though the street had folded back

on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly. 

This wall was built of paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold,

perpendicular, levelled with the square, laid out by rule and line. 

Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the case of certain

Roman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture. 

The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. 

From distance to distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface,

almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads. 

These loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces. 

The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach.  All windows

and doors were closed.  In the background rose this barrier, which made

a blind thoroughfare of the street, a motionless and tranquil wall;

no one was visible, nothing was audible; not a cry, not a sound,

not a breath.  A sepulchre.



The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light.



It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.



As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it,

it was impossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful

before this mysterious apparition.  It was adjusted, jointed,

imbricated, rectilinear, symmetrical and funereal.  Science and

gloom met there.  One felt that the chief of this barricade

was a geometrician or a spectre.  One looked at it and spoke low.



From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative

of the people, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint,

sharp whistle was heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or,

if he escaped the bullet, sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce

itself in some closed shutter, in the interstice between two blocks

of stone, or in the plaster of a wall.  For the men in the barricade

had made themselves two small cannons out of two cast-iron lengths

of gas-pipe, plugged up at one end with tow and fire-clay.

There was no waste of useless powder.  Nearly every shot told. 

There were corpses here and there, and pools of blood on the pavement. 

I remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street. 

Summer does not abdicate.



In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were

encumbered with wounded.



One felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see,

and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length

of the street.



Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal

forms at the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers

of the attacking column, gravely and thoughtfully, watched this

dismal redoubt, this immobility, this passivity, whence sprang death. 

Some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve

of the bridge, taking care that their shakos did not project beyond it.



The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a

shudder.--"How that is built!" he said to a Representative. 

"Not one paving-stone projects beyond its neighbor.  It is made

of porcelain."--At that moment, a bullet broke the cross on his breast,

and he fell.



"The cowards!" people said.  "Let them show themselves.  Let us

see them!  They dare not!  They are hiding!"



The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men,

attacked by ten thousand, held out for three days.  On the fourth,

they did as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses,

they came over the roofs, the barricade was taken.  Not one

of the eighty cowards thought of flight, all were killed there

with the exception of the leader, Barthelemy, of whom we shall

speak presently.



The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade

of the Temple was silence.  The difference between these two redoubts

was the difference between the formidable and the sinister. 

One seemed a maw; the other a mask.



Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was

composed of a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first

barricade the dragon, and behind the second the sphinx.



These two fortresses had been erected by two men named,

the one, Cournet, the other, Barthelemy.  Cournet made the

Saint-Antoine barricade; Barthelemy the barricade of the Temple. 

Each was the image of the man who had built it.



Cournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face,

a crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible eye. 

Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men,

the most formidable of combatants.  War, strife, conflict, were the

very air he breathed and put him in a good humor.  He had been an

officer in the navy, and, from his gestures and his voice, one divined

that he sprang from the ocean, and that he came from the tempest;

he carried the hurricane on into battle.  With the exception

of the genius, there was in Cournet something of Danton, as, with

the exception of the divinity, there was in Danton something of Hercules.



Barthelemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic

street urchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman,

lay in wait for him, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent

to the galleys.  He came out and made this barricade.



Later on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all,

Barthelemy slew Cournet.  It was a funereal duel.  Some time afterwards,

caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in

which passion plays a part, a catastrophe in which French justice

sees extenuating circumstances, and in which English justice sees

only death, Barthelemy was hanged.  The sombre social construction

is so made that, thanks to material destitution, thanks to

moral obscurity, that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence,

certainly firm, possibly great, began in France with the galleys,

and ended in England with the gallows.  Barthelemy, on occasion,

flew but one flag, the black flag.







CHAPTER II



WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE





Sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection,

and June, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. 

So the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline,

and an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have

just sketched; but it was formidable for that epoch.



The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer looked

after anything, had made good use of the night.  The barricade had

been not only repaired, but augmented.  They had raised it two feet. 

Bars of iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. 

All sorts of rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated

the external confusion.  The redoubt had been cleverly made over,

into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside.



The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it

like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed.



The barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered,

the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the

wounded completed, the powder scattered on the ground and on the

tables had been gathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured,

lint scraped, the fallen weapons re-distributed, the interior

of the redoubt cleaned, the rubbish swept up, corpses removed.



They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondetour lane, of which they were

still the masters.  The pavement was red for a long time at that spot. 

Among the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs. 

Enjolras had their uniforms laid aside.



Enjolras had advised two hours of sleep.  Advice from Enjolras

was a command.  Still, only three or four took advantage of it.



Feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription

on the wall which faced the tavern:--



                     LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!



These four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail,

could be still read on the wall in 1848.



The three women had profited by the respite of the night to

vanish definitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.



They had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house.



The greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still. 

On a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen,

which had been converted into an ambulance, there were five men

gravely wounded, two of whom were municipal guardsmen.  The municipal

guardsmen were attended to first.



In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth

and Javert bound to his post.



"This is the hall of the dead," said Enjolras.



In the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end,

the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar,

a sort of vast, vague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf

lying prone.



The pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade,

was still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag

to it.



Enjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing

what he said, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody

coat of the old man's.



No repast had been possible.  There was neither bread nor meat. 

The fifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty

provisions of the wine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had

passed there.  At a given moment, every barricade inevitably becomes

the raft of la Meduse.  They were obliged to resign themselves to hunger. 

They had then reached the first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th

of June when, in the barricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the

insurgents who demanded bread, replied to all combatants crying: 

"Something to eat!" with:  "Why?  It is three o'clock; at four we

shall be dead."



As they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. 

He interdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.



They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed. 

Enjolras and Combeferre examined them.  Combeferre when he

came up again said:--"It's the old stock of Father Hucheloup,

who began business as a grocer."--"It must be real wine,"

observed Bossuet.  "It's lucky that Grantaire is asleep.  If he

were on foot, there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving

those bottles."--Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs, placed his veto

on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might touch them,

he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeuf was lying.



About two o'clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. 

There were still thirty-seven of them.



The day began to dawn.  The torch, which had been replaced in its

cavity in the pavement, had just been extinguished.  The interior

of the barricade, that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from

the street, was bathed in shadows, and resembled, athwart the vague,

twilight horror, the deck of a disabled ship.  The combatants,

as they went and came, moved about there like black forms. 

Above that terrible nesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute

houses were lividly outlined; at the very top, the chimneys

stood palely out.  The sky was of that charming, undecided hue,

which may be white and may be blue.  Birds flew about in it with cries

of joy.  The lofty house which formed the back of the barricade,

being turned to the East, had upon its roof a rosy reflection. 

The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man

at the third-story window.



"I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished," said Courfeyrac

to Feuilly.  "That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. 

It had the appearance of being afraid.  The light of torches resembles

the wisdom of cowards; it gives a bad light because it trembles."



Dawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.



Joly, perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter, extracted philosophy

from it.



"What is the cat?" he exclaimed.  "It is a corrective.  The good God,

having made the mouse, said:  `Hullo! I have committed a blunder.' 

And so he made the cat.  The cat is the erratum of the mouse. 

The mouse, plus the cat, is the proof of creation revised

and corrected."



Combeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking

of the dead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even

of Cabuc, and of Enjolras' sad severity.  He said:--



"Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell,

Charlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it

was too late.  Our hearts quiver so, and human life is such a

mystery that, even in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder

for liberation, if there be such a thing, the remorse for having

struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race."



And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment

later, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire's verses,

Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics,

Raux with Cournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages

translated by Malfilatre, particularly the prodigies of Caesar's death;

and at that word, Caesar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.



"Caesar," said Combeferre, "fell justly.  Cicero was severe towards

Caesar, and he was right.  That severity is not diatribe.  When Zoilus

insults Homer, when Maevius insults Virgil, when Vise insults Moliere,

when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire,

it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out;

genius attracts insult, great men are always more or less barked at. 

But Zoilus and Cicero are two different persons.  Cicero is an arbiter

in thought, just as Brutus is an arbiter by the sword.  For my own part,

I blame that last justice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. 

Caesar, the violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as though they

came from him, the dignities which emanated from the people,

not rising at the entrance of the senate, committed the acts

of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia ac pene tyrannica. 

He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the better;

the lesson is but the more exalted.  His twenty-three wounds

touch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. 

Caesar is stabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. 

One feels the God through the greater outrage."



Bossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit

of a heap of paving-stones, exclaimed, rifle in hand:--



"Oh Cydathenaeum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of

the AEantides!  Oh!  Who will grant me to pronounce the verses

of Homer like a Greek of Laurium or of Edapteon?"







CHAPTER III



LIGHT AND SHADOW





Enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance.  He had made his way

out through Mondetour lane, gliding along close to the houses.



The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope.  The manner in which

they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them

to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn.  They waited for it

with a smile.  They had no more doubt as to their success than as to

their cause.  Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. 

They reckoned on it.  With that facility of triumphant prophecy

which is one of the sources of strength in the French combatant,

they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases. 

At six o'clock in the morning a regiment "which had been

labored with," would turn; at noon, the insurrection of all Paris;

at sunset, revolution.



They heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had not been silent

for an instant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade,

the great one, Jeanne's, still held out.



All these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a

sort of gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike

hum of a hive of bees.



Enjolras reappeared.  He returned from his sombre eagle flight

into outer darkness.  He listened for a moment to all this joy

with folded arms, and one hand on his mouth.  Then, fresh and rosy

in the growing whiteness of the dawn, he said:



"The whole army of Paris is to strike.  A third of the army is bearing

down upon the barricades in which you now are.  There is the National

Guard in addition.  I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line,

and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion.  In one hour you will

be attacked.  As for the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-day it

is not stirring.  There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope for. 

Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment.  You are abandoned."



These words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on them

the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. 

A moment of indescribable silence ensued, in which death might have

been heard flitting by.



This moment was brief.



A voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras:



"So be it.  Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet,

and let us all remain in it.  Citizens, let us offer the protests

of corpses.  Let us show that, if the people abandon the republicans,

the republicans do not abandon the people."



These words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of

individual anxieties.  It was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation.



No one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some

unknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero,

that great anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social

geneses who, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion

the decisive word, and who vanishes into the shadows after having

represented for a minute, in a lightning flash, the people and God.



This inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air

of the 6th of June, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour,

on the barricade Saint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor

which has become a matter of history and which has been consigned

to the documents in the case:--"What matters it whether they come

to our assistance or not?  Let us get ourselves killed here,

to the very last man."



As the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated,

were in communication with each other.







CHAPTER IV



MINUS FIVE, PLUS ONE





After the man who decreed the "protest of corpses" had spoken,

and had given this formula of their common soul, there issued from

all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry, funereal in sense

and triumphant in tone:



"Long live death!  Let us all remain here!"



"Why all?" said Enjolras.



"All!  All!"



Enjolras resumed:



"The position is good; the barricade is fine.  Thirty men are enough. 

Why sacrifice forty?"



They replied:



"Because not one will go away."



"Citizens," cried Enjolras, and there was an almost irritated

vibration in his voice, "this republic is not rich enough in men

to indulge in useless expenditure of them.  Vain-glory is waste. 

If the duty of some is to depart, that duty should be fulfilled

like any other."



Enjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort

of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute.  Still, great as

was this omnipotence, a murmur arose.  A leader to the very finger-tips,

Enjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted.  He resumed haughtily:



"Let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so."



The murmurs redoubled.



"Besides," observed a voice in one group, "it is easy enough to talk

about leaving.  The barricade is hemmed in."



"Not on the side of the Halles," said Enjolras.  "The Rue Mondetour

is free, and through the Rue des Precheurs one can reach the Marche

des Innocents."



"And there," went on another voice, "you would be captured. 

You would fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs;

they will spy a man passing in blouse and cap.  `Whence come you?' 

`Don't you belong to the barricade?'  And they will look at your hands. 

You smell of powder.  Shot."



Enjolras, without making any reply, touched Combeferre's shoulder,

and the two entered the tap-room.



They emerged thence a moment later.  Enjolras held in his

outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. 

Combeferre followed, carrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos.



"With this uniform," said Enjolras, "you can mingle with the ranks

and escape; here is enough for four."  And he flung on the ground,

deprived of its pavement, the four uniforms.



No wavering took place in his stoical audience.  Combeferre took

the word.



"Come, said he, "you must have a little pity.  Do you know what the

question is here?  It is a question of women.  See here.  Are there

women or are there not?  Are there children or are there not? 

Are there mothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot

and who have a lot of little ones around them?  Let that man of you

who has never beheld a nurse's breast raise his hand.  Ah! you

want to get yourselves killed, so do I--I, who am speaking to you;

but I do not want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their

arms around me.  Die, if you will, but don't make others die. 

Suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here

are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not admit of extension;

and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide is murder. 

Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks. 

Listen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of

the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window,

on the fifth floor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head

of an old woman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching. 

Perhaps she is the mother of some one of you.  Well, let that man go,

and make haste, to say to his mother:  `Here I am, mother!'  Let him

feel at ease, the task here will be performed all the same. 

When one supports one's relatives by one's toil, one has not the

right to sacrifice one's self.  That is deserting one's family. 

And those who have daughters! what are you thinking of?  You get

yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well.  And tomorrow?  Young girls

without bread--that is a terrible thing.  Man begs, woman sells. 

Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious and so sweet,

who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who sing

and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence

of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne,

that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures who are your

blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! 

What do you want me to say to you?  There is a market for human flesh;

and it is not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them,

that you will prevent them from entering it!  Think of the street,

think of the pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past

which women go and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. 

These women, too, were pure once.  Think of your sisters, those of

you who have them.  Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare--

that is what those beautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels

of modesty, gentleness and loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the

month of May, will come to.  Ah! you have got yourselves killed! 

You are no longer on hand!  That is well; you have wished to release

the people from Royalty, and you deliver over your daughters to

the police.  Friends, have a care, have mercy.  Women, unhappy women,

we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them. 

We trust to the women not having received a man's education,

we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, we prevent

their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them from

going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your bodies? 

Let us see, those who have families must be tractable, and shake hands

with us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to attend

to this affair.  I know well that courage is required to leave,

that it is hard; but the harder it is, the more meritorious. 

You say:  `I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse,

I shall remain there.'  So much the worse is easily said.  My friends,

there is a morrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will;

and what sufferings!  See, here is a pretty, healthy child,

with cheeks like an apple, who babbles, prattles, chatters, who laughs,

who smells sweet beneath your kiss,--and do you know what becomes

of him when he is abandoned?  I have seen one, a very small creature,

no taller than that.  His father was dead.  Poor people had taken

him in out of charity, but they had bread only for themselves. 

The child was always hungry.  It was winter.  He did not cry. 

You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never

any fire, and whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and yellow clay. 

His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, his limbs flaccid,

his belly prominent.  He said nothing.  If you spoke to him,

he did not answer.  He is dead.  He was taken to the Necker Hospital,

where I saw him.  I was house-surgeon in that hospital.  Now, if there

are any fathers among you, fathers whose happiness it is to stroll

on Sundays holding their child's tiny hand in their robust hand,

let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own. 

That poor brat, I remember, and I seem to see him now, when he lay

nude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin

like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery.  A sort of mud was

found in his stomach.  There were ashes in his teeth.  Come, let us

examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart. 

Statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five

per cent.  I repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers,

it concerns young girls, it concerns little children.  Who is talking

to you of yourselves?  We know well what you are; we know well that

you are all brave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your

souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause;

we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully

and magnificently, and that each one of you clings to his share

in the triumph.  Very well.  But you are not alone in this world. 

There are other beings of whom you must think.  You must not be

egoists."



All dropped their heads with a gloomy air.



Strange contradictions of the human heart at its most

sublime moments.  Combeferre, who spoke thus, was not an orphan. 

He recalled the mothers of other men, and forgot his own. 

He was about to get himself killed.  He was "an egoist."



Marius, fasting, fevered, having emerged in succession from all hope,

and having been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks,

and saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end

was near, had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor

which always precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted.



A physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms

of that febrile absorption known to, and classified by, science,

and which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure. 

Despair, also, has its ecstasy.  Marius had reached this point. 

He looked on at everything as from without; as we have said,

things which passed before him seemed far away; he made out the whole,

but did not perceive the details.  He beheld men going and coming

as through a flame.  He heard voices speaking as at the bottom

of an abyss.



But this moved him.  There was in this scene a point which

pierced and roused even him.  He had but one idea now, to die;

and he did not wish to be turned aside from it, but he reflected,

in his gloomy somnambulism, that while destroying himself,

he was not prohibited from saving some one else.



He raised his voice.



"Enjolras and Combeferre are right," said he; "no unnecessary sacrifice. 

I join them, and you must make haste.  Combeferre has said convincing

things to you.  There are some among you who have families,

mothers, sisters, wives, children.  Let such leave the ranks."



No one stirred.



"Married men and the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!"

repeated Marius.



His authority was great.  Enjolras was certainly the head

of the barricade, but Marius was its savior.



"I order it," cried Enjolras.



"I entreat you," said Marius.



Then, touched by Combeferre's words, shaken by Enjolras' order,

touched by Marius' entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce

each other.--"It is true," said one young man to a full grown man,

"you are the father of a family.  Go."--"It is your duty rather,"

retorted the man, "you have two sisters whom you maintain."--

And an unprecedented controversy broke forth.  Each struggled to

determine which should not allow himself to be placed at the door

of the tomb.



"Make haste," said Courfeyrac, "in another quarter of an hour it

will be too late."



"Citizens," pursued Enjolras, "this is the Republic, and universal

suffrage reigns.  Do you yourselves designate those who are to go."



They obeyed.  After the expiration of a few minutes, five were

unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks.



"There are five of them!" exclaimed Marius.



There were only four uniforms.



"Well," began the five, "one must stay behind."



And then a struggle arose as to who should remain, and who should

find reasons for the others not remaining.  The generous quarrel

began afresh.



"You have a wife who loves you."--"You have your aged mother."--"

You have neither father nor mother, and what is to become of your

three little brothers?"--"You are the father of five children."--"You

have a right to live, you are only seventeen, it is too early

for you to die."



These great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism. 

The improbable was simple there.  These men did not astonish each other.



"Be quick," repeated Courfeyrac.



Men shouted to Marius from the groups:



"Do you designate who is to remain."



"Yes," said the five, "choose.  We will obey you."



Marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion. 

Still, at this idea, that of choosing a man for death, his blood

rushed back to his heart.  He would have turned pale, had it been

possible for him to become any paler.



He advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each,

with his eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the

depths of history hovering over Thermopylae, cried to him:



"Me! me! me!"



And Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! 

Then his glance dropped to the four uniforms.



At that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the

other four.



The fifth man was saved.



Marius raised his eyes and recognized M. Fauchelevent.



Jean Valjean had just entered the barricade.



He had arrived by way of Mondetour lane, whither by dint of

inquiries made, or by instinct, or chance.  Thanks to his dress

of a National Guardsman, he had made his way without difficulty.



The sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondetour

had no occasion to give the alarm for a single National Guardsman,

and he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street,

saying to himself:  "Probably it is a reinforcement, in any case it

is a prisoner."  The moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel

abandoning his duty and his post of observation.



At the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had

noticed him, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the

four uniforms.  Jean Valjean also had seen and heard, and he

had silently removed his coat and flung it on the pile with the rest.



The emotion aroused was indescribable.



"Who is this man?" demanded Bossuet.



"He is a man who saves others," replied Combeferre.



Marius added in a grave voice:



"I know him."



This guarantee satisfied every one.



Enjolras turned to Jean Valjean.



"Welcome, citizen."



And he added:



"You know that we are about to die."



Jean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was

saving to don his uniform.







CHAPTER V



THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A BARRICADE





The situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place,

had as result and culminating point Enjolras' supreme melancholy.



Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution;

he was incomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so;

he had too much of Saint-Just about him, and not enough of

Anacharsis Cloots; still, his mind, in the society of the Friends

of the A B C, had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from

Combeferre's ideas; for some time past, he had been gradually emerging

from the narrow form of dogma, and had allowed himself to incline

to the broadening influence of progress, and he had come to accept,

as a definitive and magnificent evolution, the transformation

of the great French Republic, into the immense human republic. 

As far as the immediate means were concerned, a violent situation

being given, he wished to be violent; on that point, he never varied;

and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is

summed up in the words:  "Eighty-three." Enjolras was standing

erect on the staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on

the stock of his gun.  He was engaged in thought; he quivered,

as at the passage of prophetic breaths; places where death is

have these effects of tripods.  A sort of stifled fire darted

from his eyes, which were filled with an inward look.  All at once

he threw back his head, his blond locks fell back like those of

an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, they were like

the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, and Enjolras cried:



"Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves?  The streets

of cities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds,

nations sisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past

loving the present, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on

terms of full equality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest,

human conscience become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity

of the workshop and the school, for sole penalty and recompense fame,

work for all, right for all, peace over all, no more bloodshed,

no more wars, happy mothers!  To conquer matter is the first step;

to realize the ideal is the second.  Reflect on what progress has

already accomplished.  Formerly, the first human races beheld

with terror the hydra pass before their eyes, breathing on

the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who was

the monster of the air, and who flew with the wings of an eagle

and the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which were above man. 

Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by intelligence,

and finally conquered these monsters.  We have vanquished the hydra,

and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing

the griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. 

On the day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished,

and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple

Chimaera of antiquity, the hydra, the dragon and the griffin,

he will be the master of water, fire, and of air, and he will be

for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods

formerly were to him.  Courage, and onward!  Citizens, whither are

we going?  To science made government, to the force of things

become the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself

its sanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence,

to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day.  We are advancing

to the union of peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. 

No more fictions; no more parasites.  The real governed by the true,

that is the goal.  Civilization will hold its assizes at the

summit of Europe, and, later on, at the centre of continents,

in a grand parliament of the intelligence.  Something similar

has already been seen.  The amphictyons had two sittings a year,

one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylae,

the place of heroes.  Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe

will have its amphictyons.  France bears this sublime future

in her breast.  This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. 

That which Greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by France. 

Listen to me, you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. 

I revere you.  Yes, you clearly behold the future, yes, you are right. 

You had neither father nor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity

for your mother and right for your father.  You are about to die,

that is to say to triumph, here.  Citizens, whatever happens

to-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, it is

a revolution that we are about to create.  As conflagrations light

up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate the whole human race. 

And what is the revolution that we shall cause?  I have just told you,

the Revolution of the True.  From a political point of view,

there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over himself. 

This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty.  Where two

or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. 

But in that association there is no abdication.  Each sovereignty

concedes a certain quantity of itself, for the purpose of forming

the common right.  This quantity is the same for all of us. 

This identity of concession which each makes to all, is called Equality. 

Common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming

on the right of each.  This protection of all over each is

called Fraternity.  The point of intersection of all these assembled

sovereignties is called society.  This intersection being a junction,

this point is a knot.  Hence what is called the social bond. 

Some say social contract; which is the same thing, the word

contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond. 

Let us come to an understanding about equality; for, if liberty is

the summit, equality is the base.  Equality, citizens, is not wholly

a surface vegetation, a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks;

a proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void;

legally speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity;

politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight;

religiously, it is all consciences possessed of the same right. 

Equality has an organ:  gratuitous and obligatory instruction. 

The right to the alphabet, that is where the beginning must

be made.  The primary school imposed on all, the secondary school

offered to all, that is the law.  From an identical school,

an identical society will spring.  Yes, instruction! light! light!

everything comes from light, and to it everything returns. 

Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century

will be happy.  Then, there will be nothing more like the history

of old, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest,

an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand,

an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings,

on a birth in hereditary tyrannies, a partition of peoples by

a congress, a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty,

a combat of two religions meeting face to face, like two bucks

in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we shall no longer have

to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arising from distress,

misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword,

and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events. 

One might almost say:  There will be no more events.  We shall

be happy.  The human race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial

globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between

the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth,

as the planet around the light.  Friends, the present hour in which I

am addressing you, is a gloomy hour; but these are terrible purchases

of the future.  A revolution is a toll.  Oh! the human race will

be delivered, raised up, consoled!  We affirm it on this barrier. 

Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from the heights

of sacrifice?  Oh my brothers, this is the point of junction,

of those who think and of those who suffer; this barricade is

not made of paving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of iron;

it is made of two heaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. 

Here misery meets the ideal.  The day embraces the night,

and says to it:  `I am about to die, and thou shalt be born again

with me.'  From the embrace of all desolations faith leaps forth. 

Sufferings bring hither their agony and ideas their immortality. 

This agony and this immortality are about to join and constitute

our death.  Brothers, he who dies here dies in the radiance

of the future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the

dawn."



Enjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to

move silently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused

them all to gaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. 

There was no applause; but they whispered together for a long time. 

Speech being a breath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the

rustling of leaves.







CHAPTER VI



MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONIC





Let us narrate what was passing in Marius' thoughts.



Let the reader recall the state of his soul.  We have just recalled it,

everything was a vision to him now.  His judgment was disturbed. 

Marius, let us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great,

dark wings which are spread over those in the death agony. 

He felt that he had entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he

was already on the other side of the wall, and he no longer beheld

the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead.



How did M. Fauchelevent come there?  Why was he there?  What had

he come there to do?  Marius did not address all these questions

to himself.  Besides, since our despair has this peculiarity,

that it envelops others as well as ourselves, it seemed logical

to him that all the world should come thither to die.



Only, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart.



However, M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at him,

and had not even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice

to say:  "I know him."



As far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent

was comforting, and, if such a word can be used for such impressions,

we should say that it pleased him.  He had always felt the absolute

impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man, who was,

in his eyes, both equivocal and imposing.  Moreover, it had been

a long time since he had seen him; and this still further augmented

the impossibility for Marius' timid and reserved nature.



The five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondetour lane;

they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. 

One of them wept as he took his leave.  Before setting out,

they embraced those who remained.



When the five men sent back to life had taken their departure,

Enjolras thought of the man who had been condemned to death.



He entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged

in meditation.



"Do you want anything?"  Enjolras asked him.



"Javert replied:  "When are you going to kill me?"



"Wait.  We need all our cartridges just at present."



"Then give me a drink," said Javert.



Enjolras himself offered him a glass of water, and, as Javert

was pinioned, he helped him to drink.



"Is that all?" inquired Enjolras.



"I am uncomfortable against this post," replied Javert. 

"You are not tender to have left me to pass the night here. 

Bind me as you please, but you surely might lay me out on a table

like that other man."



And with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf.



There was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table

at the end of the room, on which they had been running bullets

and making cartridges.  All the cartridges having been made,

and all the powder used, this table was free.



At Enjolras' command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post. 

While they were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast.



Leaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet a

slender but stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mounting

the scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches

in length, and made him walk to the table at the end of the room,

where they laid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body.



By way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his neck,

they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt

at escape impossible, that sort of bond which is called in prisons

a martingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the stomach,

and meets the hands, after passing between the legs.



While they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold

was surveying him with singular attention.  The shadow cast by this

man made Javert turn his head.  He raised his eyes, and recognized

Jean Valjean.  He did not even start, but dropped his lids proudly

and confined himself to the remark:  "It is perfectly simple."







CHAPTER VII



THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED





The daylight was increasing rapidly.  Not a window was opened,

not a door stood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. 

The end of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been

evacuated by the troops, as we have stated it seemed to be free,

and presented itself to passers-by with a sinister tranquillity. 

The Rue Saint-Denis was as dumb as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. 

Not a living being in the cross-roads, which gleamed white in the light

of the sun.  Nothing is so mournful as this light in deserted streets. 

Nothing was to be seen, but there was something to be heard. 

A mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance. 

It was evident that the critical moment was approaching.  As on

the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; but this time all

had come.



The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack. 

Since the departure of the five, they had increased its height

still further.



On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of

the Halles, Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to

a serious decision.  He had the small gut of the Mondetour lane,

which had been left open up to that time, barricaded.  For this purpose,

they tore up the pavement for the length of several houses more. 

In this manner, the barricade, walled on three streets, in front

on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de

la Petite Truanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondetour, was really

almost impregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. 

It had three fronts, but no exit.--"A fortress but a rat hole too,"

said Courfeyrac with a laugh.



Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones "torn up in excess,"

said Bossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.



The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must

needs come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.



An allowance of brandy was doled out to each.



Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. 

Each man selects his place as though at the theatre.  They jostle,

and elbow and crowd each other.  There are some who make stalls

of paving-stones. Here is a corner of the wall which is in the way,

it is removed; here is a redan which may afford protection,

they take shelter behind it.  Left-handed men are precious;

they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest.  Many arrange

to fight in a sitting posture.  They wish to be at ease to kill,

and to die comfortably.  In the sad war of June, 1848, an insurgent

who was a formidable marksman, and who was firing from the top of a

terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair brought there for his use;

a charge of grape-shot found him out there.



As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action,

all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from

one another; there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is

no more holding aloof; everything in their spirits converges in,

and changes into, a waiting for the assailants.  A barricade before

the arrival of danger is chaos; in danger, it is discipline itself. 

Peril produces order.



As soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle,

and had placed himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved

for himself, all the rest held their peace.  A series of faint,

sharp noises resounded confusedly along the wall of paving-stones.

It was the men cocking their guns.



Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever;

the excess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope,

but they had despair, despair,--the last weapon, which sometimes

gives victory; Virgil has said so.  Supreme resources spring from

extreme resolutions.  To embark in death is sometimes the means

of escaping a shipwreck; and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank

of safety.



As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed,

we might almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted

up and visible.



They had not long to wait.  A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu

quarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. 

A clashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click

of brass skipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar,

announced that some sinister construction of iron was approaching. 

There arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets,

pierced and built for the fertile circulation of interests and ideas,

and which are not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels

of war.



The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity

of the street became ferocious.



A cannon made its appearance.



Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim;

the fore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage,

four were at the wheels; others followed with the caisson. 

They could see the smoke of the burning lint-stock.



"Fire!" shouted Enjolras.



The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche

of smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds,

the cloud dispersed, and the cannon and men re-appeared; the gun-crew

had just finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste,

into position facing the barricade.  Not one of them had been struck. 

Then the captain of the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order

to raise the muzzle, began to point the cannon with the gravity

of an astronomer levelling a telescope.



"Bravo for the cannoneers!" cried Bossuet.



And the whole barricade clapped their hands.



A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street,

astride of the gutter, the piece was ready for action.  A formidable

pair of jaws yawned on the barricade.



"Come, merrily now!" ejaculated Courfeyrac.  "That's the brutal

part of it.  After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. 

The army is reaching out its big paw to us.  The barricade is going

to be severely shaken up.  The fusillade tries, the cannon takes."



"It is a piece of eight, new model, brass," added Combeferre. 

"Those pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten

parts of tin to one hundred of brass is exceeded.  The excess

of tin renders them too tender.  Then it comes to pass that they

have caves and chambers when looked at from the vent hole.  In order

to obviate this danger, and to render it possible to force the charge,

it may become necessary to return to the process of the fourteenth

century, hooping, and to encircle the piece on the outside with a

series of unwelded steel bands, from the breech to the trunnions. 

In the meantime, they remedy this defect as best they may;

they manage to discover where the holes are located in the vent

of a cannon, by means of a searcher.  But there is a better method,

with Gribeauval's movable star."



"In the sixteenth century," remarked Bossuet, "they used to rifle cannon."



"Yes," replied Combeferre, "that augments the projectile force,

but diminishes the accuracy of the firing.  In firing at short range,

the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola

is exaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently

rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is,

nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases

with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge. 

This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the

rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness

of the charge; small charges for that sort of engine are imposed

by the ballistic necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation

of the gun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do

all that it desires; force is a great weakness.  A cannon-ball only

travels six hundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand

leagues a second.  Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon."



"Reload your guns," said Enjolras.



How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the

cannon-balls? Would they effect a breach?  That was the question. 

While the insurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men

were loading the cannon.



The anxiety in the redoubt was profound.



The shot sped the report burst forth.



"Present!" shouted a joyous voice.



And Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball

dashed against it.



He came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had nimbly

climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth

of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.



Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than

the cannon-ball.



The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish.  At the most there

was an omnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. 

On seeing this, the barricade burst into a laugh.



"Go on!" shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.







CHAPTER VIII



THE ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY





Thet flocked round Gavroche.  But he had no time to tell anything. 

Marius drew him aside with a shudder.



"What are you doing here?"



"Hullo!" said the child, "what are you doing here yourself?"



And he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. 

His eyes grew larger with the proud light within them.



It was with an accent of severity that Marius continued:



"Who told you to come back?  Did you deliver my letter at the address?"



Gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of

that letter.  In his haste to return to the barricade, he had got

rid of it rather than delivered it.  He was forced to acknowledge

to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger

whose face he had not been able to make out.  It is true that

the man was bareheaded, but that was not sufficient.  In short,

he had been administering to himself little inward remonstrances

and he feared Marius' reproaches.  In order to extricate himself

from the predicament, he took the simplest course; he lied abominably.



"Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter.  The lady was asleep. 

She will have the letter when she wakes up.



Marius had had two objects in sending that letter:  to bid farewell

to Cosette and to save Gavroche.  He was obliged to content himself

with the half of his desire.



The despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent

in the barricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. 

He pointed out M. Fauchelevent to Gavroche.



"Do you know that man?"



"No," said Gavroche.



Gavroche had, in fact, as we have just mentioned, seen Jean Valjean

only at night.



The troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves

in Marius' mind were dissipated.  Did he know M. Fauchelevent's opinions? 

Perhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican.  Hence his very natural

presence in this combat.



In the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end

of the barricade:  "My gun!"



Courfeyrac had it returned to him.



Gavroche warned "his comrades" as he called them, that the barricade

was blocked.  He had had great difficulty in reaching it. 

A battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite

Truanderie was on the watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the

opposite side, the municipal guard occupied the Rue des Precheurs. 

The bulk of the army was facing them in front.



This information given, Gavroche added:



"I authorize you to hit 'em a tremendous whack."



Meanwhile, Enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his embrasure.



The assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had not

repeated it.



A company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end

of the street behind the piece of ordnance.  The soldiers were

tearing up the pavement and constructing with the stones a small,

low wall, a sort of side-work not more than eighteen inches high,

and facing the barricade.  In the angle at the left of this epaulement,

there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the

suburbs massed in the Rue Saint-Denis.



Enjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar

sound which is produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn

from the caissons, and he saw the commander of the piece change the

elevation and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left. 

Then the cannoneers began to load the piece.  The chief seized

the lint-stock himself and lowered it to the vent.



"Down with your heads, hug the wall!" shouted Enjolras, "and all

on your knees along the barricade!"



The insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop,

and who had quitted their posts of combat on Gavroche's arrival,

rushed pell-mell towards the barricade; but before Enjolras'

order could be executed, the discharge took place with the terrifying

rattle of a round of grape-shot. This is what it was, in fact.



The charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, and had there

rebounded from the wall; and this terrible rebound had produced

two dead and three wounded.



If this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. 

The grape-shot made its way in.



A murmur of consternation arose.



"Let us prevent the second discharge," said Enjolras.



And, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun,

who, at that moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun

and rectifying and definitely fixing its pointing.



The captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery,

very young, blond, with a very gentle face, and the intelligent

air peculiar to that predestined and redoubtable weapon which,

by dint of perfecting itself in horror, must end in killing war.



Combeferre, who was standing beside Enjolras, scrutinized this

young man.



"What a pity!" said Combeferre.  "What hideous things these

butcheries are!  Come, when there are no more kings, there will

be no more war.  Enjolras, you are taking aim at that sergeant,

you are not looking at him.  Fancy, he is a charming young man;

he is intrepid; it is evident that he is thoughtful; those young

artillery-men are very well educated; he has a father, a mother,

a family; he is probably in love; he is not more than five and twenty

at the most; he might be your brother."



"He is," said Enjolras.



"Yes," replied Combeferre, "he is mine too.  Well, let us not

kill him."



"Let me alone.  It must be done."



And a tear trickled slowly down Enjolras' marble cheek.



At the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle.  The flame

leaped forth.  The artillery-man turned round twice, his arms

extended in front of him, his head uplifted, as though for breath,

then he fell with his side on the gun, and lay there motionless. 

They could see his back, from the centre of which there flowed

directly a stream of blood.  The ball had traversed his breast

from side to side.  He was dead.



He had to be carried away and replaced by another.  Several minutes

were thus gained, in fact.







CHAPTER IX



EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THAT INFALLIBLE

MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796





Opinions were exchanged in the barricade.  The firing from the gun

was about to begin again.  Against that grape-shot, they could not

hold out a quarter of an hour longer.  It was absolutely necessary

to deaden the blows.



Enjolras issued this command:



"We must place a mattress there."



"We have none," said Combeferre, "the wounded are lying on them."



Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner

of the tavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment,

taken no part in anything that was going on.  He did not appear

to hear the combatants saying around him:  "Here is a gun that is

doing nothing."



At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.



It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue

de la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed

her mattress in front of her window.  This window, an attic window,

was on the roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond

the barricade.  The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at

the bottom on two poles for drying linen, was upheld at the top

by two ropes, which, at that distance, looked like two threads,

and which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames. 

These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky.



"Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?" said Jean Valjean.



Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him.



Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.



One of the mattress ropes was cut.



The mattress now hung by one thread only.



Jean Valjean fired the second charge.  The second rope lashed

the panes of the attic window.  The mattress slipped between

the two poles and fell into the street.



The barricade applauded.



All voices cried:



"Here is a mattress!"



"Yes," said Combeferre, "but who will go and fetch it?"



The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade,

between besiegers and besieged.  Now, the death of the sergeant

of artillery having exasperated the troop, the soldiers had,

for several minutes, been lying flat on their stomachs behind

the line of paving-stones which they had erected, and, in order

to supply the forced silence of the piece, which was quiet while

its service was in course of reorganization, they had opened fire

on the barricade.  The insurgents did not reply to this musketry,

in order to spare their ammunition The fusillade broke against

the barricade; but the street, which it filled, was terrible.



Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street,

traversed the storm of bullets, walked up to the mattress,

hoisted it upon his back, and returned to the barricade.



He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands.  He fixed

it there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men

should not see it.



That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.



It was not long in coming.



The cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. 

But there was no rebound.  The effect which they had foreseen had

been attained.  The barricade was saved.



"Citizen," said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, "the Republic thanks you."



Bossuet admired and laughed.  He exclaimed:



"It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. 

Triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning. 

But never mind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!"







CHAPTER X



DAWN





At that moment, Cosette awoke.



Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window,

facing the East on the back court-yard of the house.



Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris.  She had not

been there on the preceding evening, and she had already retired

to her chamber when Toussaint had said:



"It appears that there is a row."



Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly.  She had had

sweet dreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little

bed was very white.  Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her

in the light.  She awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first,

produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream. 

Her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one. 

Cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured.  Like Jean Valjean,

she had, a few hours previously, passed through that reaction

of the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness. 

She began to cherish hope, with all her might, without knowing why. 

Then she felt a pang at her heart.  It was three days since she

had seen Marius.  But she said to herself that he must have received

her letter, that he knew where she was, and that he was so clever

that he would find means of reaching her.--And that certainly

to-day, and perhaps that very morning.--It was broad daylight,

but the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it

was very early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to

receive Marius.



She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that,

consequently, that was sufficient and that Marius would come. 

No objection was valid.  All this was certain.  It was monstrous enough

already to have suffered for three days.  Marius absent three days,

this was horrible on the part of the good God.  Now, this cruel

teasing from on high had been gone through with.  Marius was about

to arrive, and he would bring good news.  Youth is made thus;

it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow useless and does not

accept it.  Youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an

unknown quantity, which is itself.  It is natural to it to be happy. 

It seems as though its respiration were made of hope.



Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her

on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day,

and what explanation of it he had given her.  Every one has noticed

with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls

away and hides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. 

There are thoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away

in a corner of our brain; that is the end of them; they are lost;

it is impossible to lay the memory on them.  Cosette was somewhat vexed

at the useless little effort made by her memory.  She told herself,

that it was very naughty and very wicked of her, to have forgotten

the words uttered by Marius.



She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul

and body, her prayers and her toilet.



One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into

a nuptial chamber, not into a virginal chamber.  Verse would

hardly venture it, prose must not.



It is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it is

whiteness in the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily,

which must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not

gazed upon it.  Woman in the bud is sacred.  That innocent bud

which opens, that adorable half-nudity which is afraid of itself,

that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper, that throat

which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye,

that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder

for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle, those cords tied,

those clasps fastened, those laces drawn, those tremors, those shivers

of cold and modesty, that exquisite affright in every movement,

that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm,

the successive phases of dressing, as charming as the clouds of dawn,--

it is not fitting that all this should be narrated, and it is too much

to have even called attention to it.



The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising

of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. 

The possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. 

The down on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of


the snow, the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse

compared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste. 

The young girl is only the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue. 

Her bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal. 

The indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra. 

Here, contemplation is profanation.



We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter

of Cosette's rising.



An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God,

but that Adam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and she

was ashamed and turned crimson.  We are of the number who fall

speechless in the presence of young girls and flowers, since we

think them worthy of veneration.



Cosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her hair,

which was a very simple matter in those days, when women did not

swell out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did

not put crinoline in their locks.  Then she opened the window

and cast her eyes around her in every direction, hoping to descry

some bit of the street, an angle of the house, an edge of pavement,

so that she might be able to watch for Marius there.  But no view

of the outside was to be had.  The back court was surrounded by

tolerably high walls, and the outlook was only on several gardens. 

Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous:  for the first time

in her life, she found flowers ugly.  The smallest scrap of the

gutter of the street would have met her wishes better.  She decided

to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come

from that quarter.



All at once, she burst into tears.  Not that this was fickleness

of soul; but hopes cut in twain by dejection--that was her case. 

She had a confused consciousness of something horrible.  Thoughts were

rife in the air, in fact.  She told herself that she was not sure

of anything, that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost;

and the idea that Marius could return to her from heaven appeared

to her no longer charming but mournful.



Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her,

and hope and a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trust

in God.



Every one in the house was still asleep.  A country-like silence reigned. 

Not a shutter had been opened.  The porter's lodge was closed. 

Toussaint had not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her

father was asleep.  She must have suffered much, and she must have

still been suffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her

father had been unkind; but she counted on Marius.  The eclipse

of such a light was decidedly impossible.  Now and then, she heard

sharp shocks in the distance, and she said:  "It is odd that people

should be opening and shutting their carriage gates so early." 

They were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade.



A few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient and perfectly

black cornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curve

of this nest formed a little projection beyond the cornice,

so that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise. 

The mother was there, spreading her wings like a fan over her brood;

the father fluttered about, flew away, then came back, bearing in

his beak food and kisses.  The dawning day gilded this happy thing,

the great law, "Multiply," lay there smiling and august, and that sweet

mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning.  Cosette, with her hair

in the sunlight, her soul absorbed in chimeras, illuminated by love

within and by the dawn without, bent over mechanically, and almost

without daring to avow to herself that she was thinking at the same

time of Marius, began to gaze at these birds, at this family,

at that male and female, that mother and her little ones,

with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin.







CHAPTER XI



THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONE





The assailants' fire continued.  Musketry and grape-shot alternated,

but without committing great ravages, to tell the truth.  The top

alone of the Corinthe facade suffered; the window on the first floor,

and the attic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot and biscaiens,

were slowly losing their shape.  The combatants who had been posted

there had been obliged to withdraw.  However, this is according

to the tactics of barricades; to fire for a long while, in order

to exhaust the insurgents' ammunition, if they commit the mistake

of replying.  When it is perceived, from the slackening of their fire,

that they have no more powder and ball, the assault is made. 

Enjolras had not fallen into this trap; the barricade did not reply.



At every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek

with his tongue, a sign of supreme disdain.



"Good for you," said he, "rip up the cloth.  We want some lint."



Courfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect

which it produced, and said to the cannon:



"You are growing diffuse, my good fellow."



One gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball.  It is probable that this

silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy,

and to make them fear some unexpected incident, and that they felt

the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving-stones,

and of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall

which received blows without retorting.  The insurgents suddenly

perceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. 

A fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney, and seemed to

be acting as sentinel.  His glance fell directly down into the barricade.



"There's an embarrassing watcher," said Enjolras.



Jean Valjean had returned Enjolras' rifle, but he had his own gun.



Without saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later,

the helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. 

The terrified soldier made haste to disappear.  A second observer

took his place.  This one was an officer.  Jean Valjean, who had

re-loaded his gun, took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer's

casque to join the soldier's. The officer did not persist,

and retired speedily.  This time the warning was understood. 

No one made his appearance thereafter on that roof; and the idea

of spying on the barricade was abandoned.



"Why did you not kill the man?"  Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.



Jean Valjean made no reply.







CHAPTER XII



DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER





Bossuet muttered in Combeferre's ear:



"He did not answer my question."



"He is a man who does good by gun-shots," said Combeferre.



Those who have preserved some memory of this already distant

epoch know that the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant

against insurrections.  It was particularly zealous and intrepid

in the days of June, 1832.  A certain good dram-shop keeper of

Pantin des Vertus or la Cunette, whose "establishment" had been

closed by the riots, became leonine at the sight of his deserted

dance-hall, and got himself killed to preserve the order represented

by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois and heroic time, in the presence

of ideas which had their knights, interests had their paladins. 

The prosiness of the originators detracted nothing from the

bravery of the movement.  The diminution of a pile of crowns made

bankers sing the Marseillaise.  They shed their blood lyrically

for the counting-house; and they defended the shop, that immense

diminutive of the fatherland, with Lacedaemonian enthusiasm.



At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was

not extremely serious.  It was social elements entering into strife,

while awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium.



Another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism

[the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order

in combination with lack of discipline.



The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such or such

a Colonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went into

action through inspiration; such and such National Guardsmen fought,

"for an idea," and on their own account.  At critical moments, on "days"

they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. 

There existed in the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of

the sword, like Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrede.



Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather

by an aggregation of interests than by a group of principles,

was or thought itself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm;

each, constituting himself a centre, defended it, succored it,

and protected it with his own head; and the first comer took

it upon himself to save society.



Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination.  A platoon of the National

Guard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council

of war, and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. 

It was an improvisation of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. 

Fierce Lynch law, with which no one party had any right to reproach

the rest, for it has been applied by the Republic in America,

as well as by the monarchy in Europe.  This Lynch law was complicated

with mistakes.  On one day of rioting, a young poet, named Paul

Aime Garnier, was pursued in the Place Royale, with a bayonet at

his loins, and only escaped by taking refuge under the porte-cochere

of No. 6.  They shouted:--"There's another of those Saint-Simonians!"

and they wanted to kill him.  Now, he had under his arm a volume

of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon. A National Guard had read

the words Saint-Simon on the book, and had shouted:  "Death!"



On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from

the suburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned,

had itself decimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice

and its own good pleasure.  This fact, singular though it may seem,

was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence

of the insurrection of 1832.  Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient

bourgeois, a sort of condottiere of the order of those whom we have

just characterized, a fanatical and intractable governmentalist,

could not resist the temptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition

of capturing the barricade alone and unaided, that is to say,

with his company.  Exasperated by the successive apparition of

the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag,

he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps, who were

holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive

assault had arrived, and who were allowing "the insurrection to fry

in its own fat," to use the celebrated expression of one of them. 

For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, and as that which is

ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.



He commanded men as resolute as himself, "raging fellows," as a witness

said.  His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet,

was the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. 

At the moment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched

his men against the barricade.  This movement, executed with

more good will than strategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. 

Before it had traversed two thirds of the street it was received

by a general discharge from the barricade.  Four, the most audacious,

who were running on in front, were mown down point-blank at the very

foot of the redoubt, and this courageous throng of National Guards,

very brave men but lacking in military tenacity, were forced to fall back,

after some hesitation, leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. 

This momentary hesitation gave the insurgents time to re-load

their weapons, and a second and very destructive discharge struck

the company before it could regain the corner of the street,

its shelter.  A moment more, and it was caught between two fires,

and it received the volley from the battery piece which,

not having received the order, had not discontinued its firing.



The intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from this

grape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order.



This attack, which was more furious than serious,

irritated Enjolras.--"The fools!" said he.  "They are getting

their own men killed and they are using up our ammunition for nothing."



Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was. 

Insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons. 

Insurrection, which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain number

of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend. 

An empty cartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced.  As repression

has the army, it does not count its men, and, as it has Vincennes,

it does not count its shots.  Repression has as many regiments

as the barricade has men, and as many arsenals as the barricade has

cartridge-boxes. Thus they are struggles of one against a hundred,

which always end in crushing the barricade; unless the revolution,

uprising suddenly, flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. 

This does happen sometimes.  Then everything rises, the pavements

begin to seethe, popular redoubts abound.  Paris quivers supremely,

the quid divinum is given forth, a 10th of August is in the air,

a 29th of July is in the air, a wonderful light appears, the yawning

maw of force draws back, and the army, that lion, sees before it,

erect and tranquil, that prophet, France.







CHAPTER XIII



PASSING GLEAMS





In the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade,

there is a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth,

honor, enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler,

and, above all, intermittences of hope.



One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope

suddenly traversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie

at the moment when it was least expected.



"Listen," suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch,

"it seems to me that Paris is waking up."



It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection

broke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. 

The obstinacy of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated

some fancies.  Barricades were begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue

des Gravilliers.  In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man,

armed with a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. 

In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he placed one knee on the ground,

shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the commander of the squadron,

and turned away, saying:  "There's another who will do us no more harm."



He was put to the sword.  In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired

on the National Guard from behind a lowered blind.  The slats

of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot.  A child

fourteen years of age was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie,

with his pockets full of cartridges.  Many posts were attacked. 

At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poiree, a very lively and

utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers,

at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac de Barague. 

In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of pottery and

household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a bad sign;

and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon's old

lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet's saying at Saragossa: 

"We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on

our heads."



These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment

when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local,

this fever of wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above

those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs

of Paris,--all this, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. 

They made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration.



They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuee, de la Chanvrerie

and Saint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order

that they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able

to finish them at one blow.  Columns were thrown into the streets

where there was fermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small,

right and left, now slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. 

The troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been fired;

at the same time, manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups

on the boulevards.  This repression was not effected without

some commotion, and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to

collisions between the army and the people.  This was what Enjolras

had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the musketry. 

Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street

in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:--"Those wounded do not come

from us."



Their hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. 

In less than half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was

a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents

felt that sort of leaden cope, which the indifference of the people

casts over obstinate and deserted men, fall over them once more.



The general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline,

had miscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the

strategy of the generals could now be concentrated on the three

or four barricades which still remained standing.



The sun was mounting above the horizon.



An insurgent hailed Enjolras.



"We are hungry here.  Are we really going to die like this,

without anything to eat?"



Enjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure,

made an affirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes

from the end of the street.







CHAPTER XIV



WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS' MISTRESS





Courfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras,

continued to insult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy

cloud of projectiles which is called grape-shot passed overhead

with its terrible sound he assailed it with a burst of irony.



"You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, you pain me,

you are wasting your row.  That's not thunder, it's a cough."



And the bystanders laughed.



Courfeyrac and Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with

the peril, like Madame Scarron, replaced nourishment with pleasantry,

and, as wine was lacking, they poured out gayety to all.



"I admire Enjolras," said Bossuet.  "His impassive temerity

astounds me.  He lives alone, which renders him a little sad, perhaps;

Enjolras complains of his greatness, which binds him to widowhood. 

The rest of us have mistresses, more or less, who make us crazy,

that is to say, brave.  When a man is as much in love as a tiger,

the least that he can do is to fight like a lion.  That is one way

of taking our revenge for the capers that mesdames our grisettes play

on us.  Roland gets himself killed for Angelique; all our heroism

comes from our women.  A man without a woman is a pistol without

a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off.  Well, Enjolras has

no woman.  He is not in love, and yet he manages to be intrepid. 

It is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice and as

bold as fire."



Enjolras did not appear to be listening, but had any one been near him,

that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice:  "Patria."



Bossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed:



"News!"



And assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added:



"My name is Eight-Pounder."



In fact, a new personage had entered on the scene.  This was

a second piece of ordnance.



The artillery-men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force

and placed this second piece in line with the first.



This outlined the catastrophe.



A few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firing

point-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line

and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery.



Another cannonade was audible at some distance.  At the same time

that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue

de la Chanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue

Saint-Denis, the other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling

the Saint-Merry barricade.  The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.



The barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.



One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on

the Rue de la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.



The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high,

and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme

edge of the upper crest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone

down upon the insurgents, mingled with bursts of grape-shot.



The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents

from the summit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close

in the interior, that is to say, this announced the assault.



The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls,

and from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking columns

could venture into the street without being picked off, perhaps, even,

without being seen, could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt,

as on the preceding evening, and, who knows? take it by surprise.



"It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns

should be diminished," said Enjolras, and he shouted:  "Fire on

the artillery-men!"



All were ready.  The barricade, which had long been silent,

poured forth a desperate fire; seven or eight discharges followed,

with a sort of rage and joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke,

and, at the end of a few minutes, athwart this mist all streaked

with flame, two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished

lying beneath the wheels of the cannons.  Those who were left

standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity,

but the fire had slackened.



"Things are going well now," said Bossuet to Enjolras.  "Success."



Enjolras shook his head and replied:



"Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not

be any cartridges left in the barricade."



It appears that Gavroche overheard this remark.







CHAPTER XV



GAVROCHE OUTSIDE





Courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base

of the barricade, outside in the street, amid the bullets.



Gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made

his way out through the cut, and was quietly engaged in emptying

the full cartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been

killed on the slope of the redoubt, into his basket.



"What are you doing there?" asked Courfeyrac.



Gavroche raised his face:--



"I'm filling my basket, citizen."



"Don't you see the grape-shot?"



Gavroche replied:



"Well, it is raining.  What then?"



Courfeyrac shouted:--"Come in!"



"Instanter," said Gavroche.



And with a single bound he plunged into the street.



It will be remembered that Fannicot's company had left behind

it a trail of bodies.  Twenty corpses lay scattered here and

there on the pavement, through the whole length of the street. 

Twenty cartouches for Gavroche meant a provision of cartridges

for the barricade.



The smoke in the street was like a fog.  Whoever has beheld a cloud

which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments

can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows

of lofty houses.  It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed;

hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. 

The combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street

to the other, short as it was.



This obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on

by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade,

was useful to Gavroche.



Beneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size,

he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. 

He rifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without

much danger.



He crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket

in his teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body

to another, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey

opens a nut.



They did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade,

which was quite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.



On one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask.



"For thirst," said he, putting it in his pocket.



By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the

fusillade became transparent.  So that the sharpshooters of the

line ranged on the outlook behind their paving-stone dike and the

sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at the corner of the street

suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke.



At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying

near a stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.



"Fichtre!" ejaculated Gavroche.  "They are killing my dead men

for me."



A second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.--

A third overturned his basket.



Gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue.



He sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind,

his hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen

who were firing, and sang:



      "On est laid a Nanterre,       "Men are ugly at Nanterre,

       C'est la faute a Voltaire;     'Tis the  fault of Voltaire;

       Et bete a Palaiseau,           And dull at Palaiseau,

       C'est la faute a Rousseau."    'Tis the fault of Rousseau."





Then he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had

fallen from it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards

the fusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There

a fourth bullet missed him, again.  Gavroche sang:



       "Je ne suis pas notaire,      "I am not a notary,

        C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;

        Je suis un petit oiseau,      I'm a little bird,

        C'est la faute a Rousseau."   'Tis the fault of Rousseau."



   A fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet.



       "Joie est mon caractere,      "Joy is my character,

        C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;

        Misere est mon trousseau,     Misery is my trousseau,

        C'est la faute a Rousseau."   'Tis the fault of Rousseau."





Thus it went on for some time.



It was a charming and terrible sight.  Gavroche, though shot at,

was teasing the fusillade.  He had the air of being greatly diverted. 

It was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen.  To each discharge

he retorted with a couplet.  They aimed at him constantly,

and always missed him.  The National Guardsmen and the soldiers

laughed as they took aim at him.  He lay down, sprang to his feet,

hid in the corner of a doorway, then made a bound, disappeared,

re-appeared, scampered away, returned, replied to the grape-shot

with his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went on pillaging

the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes, and filling his basket. 

The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed him with their eyes. 

The barricade trembled; he sang.  He was not a child, he was not a man;

he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called the invulnerable

dwarf of the fray.  The bullets flew after him, he was more nimble

than they.  He played a fearful game of hide and seek with death;

every time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached,

the urchin administered to it a fillip.



One bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the rest,

finally struck the will-o'-the-wisp of a child.  Gavroche was seen


to stagger, then he sank to the earth.  The whole barricade gave

vent to a cry; but there was something of Antaeus in that pygmy;

for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant

to touch the earth; Gavroche had fallen only to rise again;

he remained in a sitting posture, a long thread of blood streaked

his face, he raised both arms in the air, glanced in the direction

whence the shot had come, and began to sing:





      "Je suis tombe par terre,     "I have fallen to the earth,

       C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;

       Le nez dans le ruisseau,      With my nose in the gutter,

       C'est la faute a . . . "      'Tis the fault of . . . "





He did not finish.  A second bullet from the same marksman stopped

him short.  This time he fell face downward on the pavement,

and moved no more.  This grand little soul had taken its flight.







CHAPTER XVI



HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHER





At that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,--for the gaze

of the drama must be everywhere present,--two children were holding

each other by the hand.  One might have been seven years old,

the other five.  The rain having soaked them, they were walking along

the paths on the sunny side; the elder was leading the younger;

they were pale and ragged; they had the air of wild birds. 

The smaller of them said:  "I am very hungry."



The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading his

brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.



They were alone in the garden.  The garden was deserted, the gates had

been closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. 

The troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the

exigencies of combat.



How did those children come there?  Perhaps they had escaped from

some guard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity,

at the Barriere d'Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire,

or in the neighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment

on which could be read:  Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum,

some mountebank's booth from which they had fled; perhaps they had,

on the preceding evening, escaped the eye of the inspectors

of the garden at the hour of closing, and had passed the night

in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the papers? 

The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed free.  To be astray

and to seem free is to be lost.  These poor little creatures were,

in fact, lost.



These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to

some trouble, as the reader will recollect.  Children of the Thenardiers,

leased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and now leaves

fallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the ground

by the wind.  Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon's day,

and which had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand,

had been converted into rags.



Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics

as "Abandoned children," whom the police

take note of, collect, mislay and find again on the pavements of Paris.



It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these

miserable little creatures being in that garden.  If the superintendents

had caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. 

Poor little things do not enter public gardens; still, people should

reflect that, as children, they have a right to flowers.



These children were there, thanks to the locked gates.  They were

there contrary to the regulations.  They had slipped into the garden

and there they remained.  Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors,

oversight is supposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes;

and the inspectors, moved by the public anxiety and more occupied

with the outside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden,

and had not seen the two delinquents.



It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. 

But in June, showers do not count for much.  An hour after a storm,

it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. 

The earth, in summer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. 

At that period of the solstice, the light of full noonday is,

so to speak, poignant.  It takes everything.  It applies itself to

the earth, and superposes itself with a sort of suction.  One would

say that the sun was thirsty.  A shower is but a glass of water;

a rainstorm is instantly drunk up.  In the morning everything

was dripping, in the afternoon everything is powdered over.



Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain

and wiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness.  The gardens

and meadows, having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers,

become perfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors

at once.  Everything smiles, sings and offers itself.  One feels

gently intoxicated.  The springtime is a provisional paradise,

the sun helps man to have patience.



There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having

the azure of heaven, say:  "It is enough!" dreamers absorbed in

the wonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to

good and evil, contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful

of man, who do not understand how people can occupy themselves

with the hunger of these, and the thirst of those, with the nudity

of the poor in winter, with the lymphatic curvature of the little

spinal column, with the pallet, the attic, the dungeon, and the rags

of shivering young girls, when they can dream beneath the trees;

peaceful and terrible spirits they, and pitilessly satisfied. 

Strange to say, the infinite suffices them.  That great need of man,

the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore.  The finite

which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do not think about. 

The indefinite, which is born from the human and divine combination

of the infinite and the finite, escapes them.  Provided that they are

face to face with immensity, they smile.  Joy never, ecstasy forever. 

Their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation. 

The history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan.  All is

not there; the true All remains without; what is the use of busying

oneself over that detail, man?  Man suffers, that is quite possible;

but look at Aldebaran rising!  The mother has no more milk,

the new-born babe is dying.  I know nothing about that, but just

look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the

pine presents under the microscope!  Compare the most beautiful

Mechlin lace to that if you can!  These thinkers forget to love. 

The zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents

their seeing the weeping child.  God eclipses their souls. 

This is a family of minds which are, at once, great and petty. 

Horace was one of them; so was Goethe.  La Fontaine perhaps;

magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow,

who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sun

conceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an execution by the

guillotine in the search for an effect of light, who hear neither

the cry nor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm peal,

for whom everything is well, since there is a month of May, who,

so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads,

declare themselves content, and who are determined to be happy

until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds

are exhausted.



These are dark radiances.  They have no suspicion that they

are to be pitied.  Certainly they are so.  He who does not weep

does not see.  They are to be admired and pitied, as one would

both pity and admire a being at once night and day, without eyes

beneath his lashes but with a star on his brow.



The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some,

a superior philosophy.  That may be; but in this superiority

there is some infirmity.  One may be immortal and yet limp: 

witness Vulcan.  One may be more than man and less than man. 

There is incomplete immensity in nature.  Who knows whether the sun

is not a blind man?



But then, what?  In whom can we trust?  Solem quis dicere falsum audeat? 

Who shall dare to say that the sun is false?  Thus certain geniuses,

themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? 

That which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith,

that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but little,

sees badly, sees not at all?  Is not this a desperate state of things? 

No. But what is there, then, above the sun?  The god.



On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o'clock in the morning,

the Luxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. 

The quincunxes and flower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty

into the sunlight.  The branches, wild with the brilliant glow

of midday, seemed endeavoring to embrace.  In the sycamores there

was an uproar of linnets, sparrows triumphed, woodpeckers climbed

along the chestnut trees, administering little pecks on the bark. 

The flower-beds accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies;

the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness. 

The peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible.  The old crows

of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall trees.  The sun gilded,

empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips, which are nothing

but all the varieties of flame made into flowers.  All around the

banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers, hummed. 

All was grace and gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse,

by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined

to profit, had nothing disturbing about it; the swallows indulged

in the charming threat of flying low.  He who was there aspired

to happiness; life smelled good; all nature exhaled candor,

help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn.  The thoughts which fell

from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one

kisses it.



The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow

pierced with light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight;

rays hung from them on all sides.  Around the great fountain,

the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt. 

There was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust

here and there.  A few yellow leaves, left over from the autumn,

chased each other merrily, and seemed to be playing tricks on

each other.



This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring

about it.  Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious,

beneath creation, of the enormous size of the source; in all these

breaths permeated with love, in this interchange of reverberations

and reflections, in this marvellous expenditure of rays, in this

infinite outpouring of liquid gold, one felt the prodigality of

the inexhaustible; and, behind this splendor as behind a curtain

of flame, one caught a glimpse of God, that millionaire of stars.



Thanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,

there was not a grain of ashes.  The clumps of blossoms had just

been bathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish,

which springs from the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. 

This magnificence was cleanly.  The grand silence of happy nature

filled the garden.  A celestial silence that is compatible with a

thousand sorts of music, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms,

the flutterings of the breeze.  All the harmony of the season was

complete in one gracious whole; the entrances and exits of spring

took place in proper order; the lilacs ended; the jasmines began;

some flowers were tardy, some insects in advance of their time;

the van-guard of the red June butterflies fraternized with the

rear-guard of the white butterflies of May.  The plantain trees

were getting their new skins.  The breeze hollowed out undulations

in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. It was splendid. 

A veteran from the neighboring barracks, who was gazing through

the fence, said:  "Here is the Spring presenting arms and in

full uniform."



All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour;

the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth

on earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly.  God was serving

the universal repast.  Each creature had his pasture or his mess. 

The ring-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet,

the goldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green

finch found flies, the fly found infusoriae, the bee found flowers. 

They ate each other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil

mixed with good; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.



The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity

of the grand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light,

they tried to hide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak

in the presence of even impersonal magnificence; and they kept

behind the swans' hutch.



Here and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a sort

of tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows,

which were discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. 

Smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the Halles.  A bell,

which had the air of an appeal, was ringing in the distance.



These children did not appear to notice these noises.  The little

one repeated from time to time:  "I am hungry."



Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple approached

the great basin.  They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years

of age, who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six.  No doubt,

a father and his son.  The little man of six had a big brioche.



At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the

Rues Madame and d'Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden,

of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut,

a privilege which was suppressed later on.  This father and son

came from one of these houses, no doubt.



The two poor little creatures watched "that gentleman" approaching,

and hid themselves a little more thoroughly.



He was a bourgeois.  The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had

one day heard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin,

counselling his son "to avoid excesses."  He had an affable and haughty

air, and a mouth which was always smiling, since it did not shut. 

This mechanical smile, produced by too much jaw and too little skin,

shows the teeth rather than the soul.  The child, with his brioche,

which he had bitten into but had not finished eating, seemed satiated. 

The child was dressed as a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection,

and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence.



Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting. 

This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans. 

He resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.



For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their

principal talent, and they were superb.



If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been

of an age to understand, they might have gathered the words of this

grave man.  The father was saying to his son:



"The sage lives content with little.  Look at me, my son.  I do

not love pomp.  I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace

and stones; I leave that false splendor to badly organized souls."



Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the

Halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar.



"What is that?" inquired the child.



The father replied:



"It is the Saturnalia."



All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind

the green swan-hutch.



"There is the beginning," said he.



And, after a pause, he added:



"Anarchy is entering this garden."



In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out,

and, suddenly burst out crying.



"What are you crying about?" demanded his father.



"I am not hungry any more," said the child.



The father's smile became more accentuated.



"One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake."



"My cake tires me.  It is stale."



"Don't you want any more of it?"



"No."



The father pointed to the swans.



"Throw it to those palmipeds."



The child hesitated.  A person may not want any more of his cake;

but that is no reason for giving it away.



The father went on:



"Be humane.  You must have compassion on animals."



And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.



The cake fell very near the edge.



The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy

with some prey.  They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.



The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted,

and moved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic

agitation, which finally attracted the attention of the swans.



They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships,

as they are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche,

with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures.



"The swans [cygnes] understand signs [signes]," said the bourgeois,

delighted to make a jest.



At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another

sudden increase.  This time it was sinister.  There are some gusts

of wind which speak more distinctly than others.  The one which was

blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors,

platoon firing, and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. 

This coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.



The swans had not yet reached the brioche.



"Let us return home," said the father, "they are attacking

the Tuileries."



He grasped his son's hand again.  Then he continued:



"From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance

which separates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. 

Shots will soon rain down."



He glanced at the cloud.



"Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky

is joining in; the younger branch is condemned.  Let us return

home quickly."



"I should like to see the swans eat the brioche," said the child.



The father replied:



"That would be imprudent."



And he led his little bourgeois away.



The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin

until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.



In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche

at the same time as the swans.  It was floating on the water. 

The smaller of them stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the

retreating bourgeois.



Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand

flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.



As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily

flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin,

and clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water,

on the verge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his

stick towards the cake.  The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste,

and in so doing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of

service to the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans,

and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated

the brioche towards the child's wand.  Just as the swans came up,

the stick touched the cake.  The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in

the brioche, frightened away the swans, seized the cake, and sprang

to his feet.  The cake was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty. 

The elder broke the cake into two portions, a large one and a small one,

took the small one for himself, gave the large one to his brother,

and said to him:



"Ram that into your muzzle."







CHAPTER XVII



MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTAT





Marius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. 

But he was too late.  Gavroche was dead.  Combeferre brought back

the basket of cartridges; Marius bore the child.



"Alas!" he thought, "that which the father had done for his father,

he was requiting to the son; only, Thenardier had brought back his

father alive; he was bringing back the child dead."



When Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms,

his face, like the child, was inundated with blood.



At the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had

grazed his head; he had not noticed it.



Courfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged Marius' brow.



They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over

the two corpses the black shawl.  There was enough of it for both

the old man and the child.



Combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he

had brought in.



This gave each man fifteen rounds to fire.



Jean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his

stone post.  When Combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges,

he shook his head.



"Here's a rare eccentric," said Combeferre in a low voice to Enjolras. 

"He finds a way of not fighting in this barricade."



"Which does not prevent him from defending it," responded Enjolras.



"Heroism has its originals," resumed Combeferre.



And Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added:



"He is another sort from Father Mabeuf."



One thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering

the barricade hardly disturbed the interior.  Those who have never

traversed the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the

singular moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. 

Men go and come, they talk, they jest, they lounge.  Some one whom

we know heard a combatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot:

"We are here as at a bachelor breakfast."  The redoubt of the Rue de

la Chanvrerie, we repeat, seemed very calm within.  All mutations

and all phases had been, or were about to be, exhausted.  The position,

from critical, had become menacing, and, from menacing, was probably

about to become desperate.  In proportion as the situation grew gloomy,

the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade more and more. 

Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it, in the attitude of a young

Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre genius, Epidotas.



Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: 

Bossuet and Feuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask

picked up by Gavroche on the dead corporal, and Bossuet said

to Feuilly:  "We are soon to take the diligence for another planet";

Courfeyrac was disposing and arranging on some paving-stones which

he had reserved for himself near Enjolras, a complete arsenal,

his sword-cane, his gun, two holster pistols, and a cudgel,

with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order. 

Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall opposite him.  An artisan

was fastening Mother Hucheloup's big straw hat on his head with

a string, "for fear of sun-stroke," as he said.  The young men

from the Cougourde d'Aix were chatting merrily among themselves,

as though eager to speak patois for the last time.  Joly, who had

taken Widow Hucheloup's mirror from the wall, was examining his

tongue in it.  Some combatants, having discovered a few crusts

of rather mouldy bread, in a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. 

Marius was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to say

to him.







CHAPTER XVIII



THE VULTURE BECOME PREY





We must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades. 

Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets

should be omitted.



Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we

have just mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it,

remains, none the less, a vision.



There is something of the apocalypse in civil war,

all the mists of the unknown are commingled with

fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes, and any

one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream.



The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed

out in the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences;

they are both more and less than life.  On emerging from a barricade,

one no longer knows what one has seen there.  One has been terrible,

but one knows it not.  One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas

which had human faces; one's head has been in the light of the future. 

There were corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. 

The hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity.  One has lived

in death.  Shadows have passed by.  What were they?



One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a

deafening horror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open

mouths which shouted, and other open mouths which held their peace;

one was in the midst of smoke, of night, perhaps.  One fancied

that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares

at something red on one's finger nails.  One no longer remembers anything.



Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.



All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock

striking the hour became audible.



"It is midday," said Combeferre.



The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang

to his feet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this

thundering shout:



"Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and the

roofs with them.  Half the men to their guns, the other half

to the paving-stones. There is not a minute to be lost."



A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made

their appearance in battle array at the end of the street.



This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? 

The attacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition

of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it.



They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which

M. Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called "the tug of war."



Enjolras' order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar

to ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape

is impossible.  In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones

which Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been

carried up to the first floor and the attic, and before a second

minute had elapsed, these stones, artistically set one upon the other,

walled up the sash-window on the first floor and the windows

in the roof to half their height.  A few loop-holes carefully

planned by Feuilly, the principal architect, allowed of the passage

of the gun-barrels. This armament of the windows could be effected

all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot had ceased. 

The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre

of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, if possible,

a breach for the assault.



When the stones destined to the final defence were in place,

Enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where

Mabeuf lay, carried to the first floor.



"Who is to drink that?"  Bossuet asked him.



"They," replied Enjolras.



Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the iron

cross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.



The fortress was complete.  The barricade was the rampart,

the wine-shop was the dungeon.  With the stones which remained

they stopped up the outlet.



As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing

of their ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants

combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure,

expose themselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more

than in reality, and take their ease.  The preparations for attack

are always made with a certain methodical deliberation; after which,

the lightning strikes.



This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything

and to perfect everything.  He felt that, since such men were to die,

their death ought to be a masterpiece.



He said to Marius:  "We are the two leaders.  I will give the last

orders inside.  Do you remain outside and observe."



Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade.



Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance,

as the reader will remember, nailed up.



"No splashing of the wounded," he said.



He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundly

tranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all.



"On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase. 

Have you them?"



"Yes," said Feuilly.



"How many?"



"Two axes and a pole-axe."



"That is good.  There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. 

How many guns are there?"



"Thirty-four."



"Eight too many.  Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand. 

Swords and pistols in your belts.  Twenty men to the barricade. 

Six ambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first

floor to fire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. 

Let not a single worker remain inactive here.  Presently, when the drum

beats the assault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. 

The first to arrive will have the best places."



These arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said:



"I am not forgetting you."



And, laying a pistol on the table, he added:



"The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy."



"Here?" inquired a voice.



"No, let us not mix their corpses with our own.  The little barricade

of the Mondetour lane can be scaled.  It is only four feet high. 

The man is well pinioned.  He shall be taken thither and put

to death."



There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras,

it was Javert.  Here Jean Valjean made his appearance.



He had been lost among the group of insurgents.  He stepped forth

and said to Enjolras:



"You are the commander?"



"Yes."



"You thanked me a while ago."



"In the name of the Republic.  The barricade has two saviors,

Marius Pontmercy and yourself."



"Do you think that I deserve a recompense?"



"Certainly."



"Well, I request one."



"What is it?"



"That I may blow that man's brains out."



Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost

imperceptible movement, and said:



"That is just."



As for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyes

about him:



"No objections."



And he turned to Jean Valjean:



"Take the spy."



Jean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating

himself on the end of the table.  He seized the pistol, and a faint

click announced that he had cocked it.



Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible.



"Take care!" shouted Marius from the top of the barricade.



Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar

to him, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them:



"You are in no better case than I am."



"All out!" shouted Enjolras.



The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went,

received in the back,--may we be permitted the expression,--

this sally of Javert's:



"We shall meet again shortly!"







CHAPTER XIX



JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE





When Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope

which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body,

and the knot of which was under the table.  After this he made

him a sign to rise.



Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy

of enchained authority is condensed.



Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take

a beast of burden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter

after him, emerged from the wine-shop slowly, because Javert,

with his impeded limbs, could take only very short steps.



Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand.



In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. 

The insurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent,

had their backs turned to these two.



Marius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of

the barricade, saw them pass.  This group of victim and executioner

was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul.



Jean Valjean with some difficulty, but without relaxing his hold

for a single instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the

little entrenchment in the Mondetour lane.



When they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone

in the lane.  No one saw them.  Among the heap they could

distinguish a livid face, streaming hair, a pierced hand and

the half nude breast of a woman.  It was Eponine.  The corner

of the houses hid them from the insurgents.  The corpses carried

away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant.



Javert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in

a low tone:



"It strikes me that I know that girl."



Then he turned to Jean Valjean.



Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert

a look which it required no words to interpret:  "Javert, it is I."



Javert replied:



"Take your revenge."



Jean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, and opened it.



"A clasp-knife!" exclaimed Javert, "you are right.  That suits

you better."



Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck,

then he cut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut

the cord on his feet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him:



"You are free."



Javert was not easily astonished.  Still, master of himself though

he was, he could not repress a start.  He remained open-mouthed

and motionless.



Jean Valjean continued:



"I do not think that I shall escape from this place.  But if,

by chance, I do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue

de l'Homme Arme, No. 7."



Javert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner

of his mouth, and he muttered between his teeth:



"Have a care."



"Go," said Jean Valjean.



Javert began again:



"Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l'Homme Arme?"



"Number 7."



Javert repeated in a low voice:--"Number 7."



He buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness

between his shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and,

supporting his chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction

of the Halles.  Jean Valjean followed him with his eyes:



A few minutes later, Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean:



"You annoy me.  Kill me, rather."



Javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean

Valjean as "thou."



"Be off with you," said Jean Valjean.



Javert retreated slowly.  A moment later he turned the corner

of the Rue des Precheurs.



When Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air.



Then he returned to the barricade and said:



"It is done."



In the meanwhile, this is what had taken place.



Marius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not,

up to that time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark

background of the tap-room.



When he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the

barricade in order to proceed to his death, he recognized him. 

Something suddenly recurred to his mind.  He recalled the inspector

of the Rue de Pontoise, and the two pistols which the latter had

handed to him and which he, Marius, had used in this very barricade,

and not only did he recall his face, but his name as well.



This recollection was misty and troubled, however, like all his ideas.



It was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he

put to himself:



"Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name

was Javert?"



Perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. 

But, in the first place, he must know whether this was Javert.



Marius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself

at the other extremity of the barricade:



"Enjolras!"



"What?"



"What is the name of yonder man?"



"What man?"



"The police agent.  Do you know his name?"



"Of course.  He told us."



"What is it?"



"Javert."



Marius sprang to his feet.



At that moment, they heard the report of the pistol.



Jean Valjean re-appeared and cried:  "It is done."



A gloomy chill traversed Marius' heart.







CHAPTER XX



THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THE WRONG





The death agony of the barricade was about to begin.



Everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment;

a thousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed

masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible,

the intermittent gallop of cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery

on the march, the firing by squads, and the cannonades crossing

each other in the labyrinth of Paris, the smokes of battle mounting

all gilded above the roofs, indescribable and vaguely terrible cries,

lightnings of menace everywhere, the tocsin of Saint-Merry, which now

had the accents of a sob, the mildness of the weather, the splendor

of the sky filled with sun and clouds, the beauty of the day,

and the alarming silence of the houses.



For, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue

de la Chanvrerie had become two walls; ferocious walls, doors closed,

windows closed, shutters closed.



In those days, so different from those in which we live, when the

hour was come, when the people wished to put an end to a situation,

which had lasted too long, with a charter granted or with a

legal country, when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere,

when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements,

when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its

password in its ear, then the inhabitant, thoroughly penetrated

with the revolt, so to speak, was the auxiliary of the combatant,

and the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested

on it.  When the situation was not ripe, when the insurrection

was not decidedly admitted, when the masses disowned the movement,

all was over with the combatants, the city was changed into a desert

around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges were nailed up,

and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take

the barricade.



A people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly

than it chooses.  Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand!  A people

does not let itself go at random.  Then it abandons the insurrection

to itself.  The insurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. 

A house is an escarpment, a door is a refusal, a facade is a wall. 

This wall hears, sees and will not.  It might open and save you. 

No. This wall is a judge.  It gazes at you and condemns you. 

What dismal things are closed houses.  They seem dead, they are living. 

Life which is, as it were, suspended there, persists there. 

No one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours, but no one

is missing from them.  In the interior of that rock, people go

and come, go to bed and rise again; they are a family party there;

there they eat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! 

Fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed

with it, an extenuating circumstance.  Sometimes, even, and this

has been actually seen, fear turns to passion; fright may change

into fury, as prudence does into rage; hence this wise saying: 

"The enraged moderates."  There are outbursts of supreme terror,

whence springs wrath like a mournful smoke.--"What do these people want? 

What have they come there to do?  Let them get out of the scrape. 

So much the worse for them.  It is their fault.  They are only getting

what they deserve.  It does not concern us.  Here is our poor street

all riddled with balls.  They are a pack of rascals.  Above all things,

don't open the door."--And the house assumes the air of a tomb. 

The insurgent is in the death-throes in front of that house; he sees

the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if he cries, he knows

that they are listening to him, and that no one will come; there stand

walls which might protect him, there are men who might save him;

and these walls have ears of flesh, and these men have bowels of

stone.



Whom shall he reproach?



No one and every one.



The incomplete times in which we live.



It is always at its own risk and peril that Utopia is converted

into revolution, and from philosophical protest becomes

an armed protest, and from Minerva turns to Pallas.



The Utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits it;

it almost always comes too soon.  Then it becomes resigned, and stoically

accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph.  It serves those who deny it

without complaint, even excusing them, and even disculpates them,

and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. 

It is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude.



Is this ingratitude, however?



Yes, from the point of view of the human race.



No, from the point of view of the individual.



Progress is man's mode of existence.  The general life of the human

race is called Progress, the collective stride of the human race

is called Progress.  Progress advances; it makes the great human

and terrestrial journey towards the celestial and the divine; it has

its halting places where it rallies the laggard troop, it has its

stations where it meditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan

suddenly unveiled on its horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps;

and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees

the shadow resting on the human soul, and that he gropes in darkness

without being able to awaken that slumbering Progress.



"God is dead, perhaps," said Gerard de Nerval one day to the

writer of these lines, confounding progress with God, and taking

the interruption of movement for the death of Being.



He who despairs is in the wrong.  Progress infallibly awakes, and,

in short, we may say that it marches on, even when it is asleep,

for it has increased in size.  When we behold it erect once more,

we find it taller.  To be always peaceful does not depend on

progress any more than it does on the stream; erect no barriers,

cast in no boulders; obstacles make water froth and humanity boil. 

Hence arise troubles; but after these troubles, we recognize the fact

that ground has been gained.  Until order, which is nothing else than

universal peace, has been established, until harmony and unity reign,

progress will have revolutions as its halting-places.



What, then, is progress?  We have just enunciated it; the permanent

life of the peoples.



Now, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals

offers resistance to the eternal life of the human race.



Let us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinct

interests, and can, without forfeiture, stipulate for his interest,

and defend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism;

momentary life has its rights, and is not bound to sacrifice itself

constantly to the future.  The generation which is passing in its

turn over the earth, is not forced to abridge it for the sake

of the generations, its equal, after all, who will have their turn

later on.--"I exist," murmurs that some one whose name is All. 

"I am young and in love, I am old and I wish to repose, I am the

father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I am successful in business,

I have houses to lease, I have money in the government funds,

I am happy, I have a wife and children, I have all this, I desire

to live, leave me in peace."--Hence, at certain hours, a profound

cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race.



Utopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when

it makes war.  It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode

of procedure, battle, from the lie of yesterday.  It, the future,

behaves like the past.  It, pure idea, becomes a deed of violence. 

It complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is just that

it should be held to answer; a violence of occasion and expedient,

contrary to principle, and for which it is fatally punished. 

The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old military code in its fist;

it shoots spies, it executes traitors; it suppresses living beings

and flings them into unknown darkness.  It makes use of death,

a serious matter.  It seems as though Utopia had no longer any faith

in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force.  It strikes

with the sword.  Now, no sword is simple.  Every blade has two edges;

he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.



Having made this reservation, and made it with all severity,

it is impossible for us not to admire, whether they succeed or not,

those the glorious combatants of the future, the confessors

of Utopia.  Even when they miscarry, they are worthy of veneration;

and it is, perhaps, in failure, that they possess the most majesty. 

Victory, when it is in accord with progress, merits the applause

of the people; but a heroic defeat merits their tender compassion. 

The one is magnificent, the other sublime.  For our own part,

we prefer martyrdom to success.  John Brown is greater than Washington,

and Pisacane is greater than Garibaldi.



It certainly is necessary that some one should take the part

of the vanquished.



We are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future,

when they fail.



Revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad.  Every barricade

seems a crime.  Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected,

their ulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. 

They are reproached with raising, erecting, and heaping up, against the

reigning social state, a mass of miseries, of griefs, of iniquities,

of wrongs, of despairs, and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks

of shadow in order therein to embattle themselves and to combat. 

People shout to them:  "You are tearing up the pavements of hell!" 

They might reply:  "That is because our barricade is made of

good intentions."



The best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution.  In short,

let us agree that when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear,

and it is a good will which renders society uneasy.  But it depends

on society to save itself, it is to its own good will that we make

our appeal.  No violent remedy is necessary.  To study evil amiably,

to prove its existence, then to cure it.  It is to this that we

invite it.



However that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these men,

who at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on France,

are striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal,

are august; they give their life a free offering to progress;

they accomplish the will of providence; they perform a religious act. 

At the appointed hour, with as much disinterestedness as an actor

who answers to his cue, in obedience to the divine stage-manager,

they enter the tomb.  And this hopeless combat, this stoical

disappearance they accept in order to bring about the supreme

and universal consequences, the magnificent and irresistibly human

movement begun on the 14th of July, 1789; these soldiers are priests. 

The French revolution is an act of God.



Moreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to

the distinctions already pointed out in another chapter,--there are

accepted revolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions;

there are refused revolutions, which are called riots.



An insurrection which breaks out, is an idea which is passing its

examination before the people.  If the people lets fall a black ball,

the idea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.



Waging war at every summons and every time that Utopia desires it,

is not the thing for the peoples.  Nations have not always and at

every hour the temperament of heroes and martyrs.



They are positive.  A priori, insurrection is repugnant to them,

in the first place, because it often results in a catastrophe,

in the second place, because it always has an abstraction as its point

of departure.



Because, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal,

and for the ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus

sacrifice themselves.  An insurrection is an enthusiasm.  Enthusiasm may

wax wroth; hence the appeal to arms.  But every insurrection,

which aims at a government or a regime, aims higher.  Thus, for instance,

and we insist upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection

of 1832, and, in particular, the young enthusiasts of the Rue de

la Chanvrerie were combating, was not precisely Louis Philippe. 

The majority of them, when talking freely, did justice to this king

who stood midway between monarchy and revolution; no one hated him. 

But they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in Louis

Philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in Charles X.;

and that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty

in France, was, as we have explained, the usurpation of man

over man, and of privilege over right in the entire universe. 

Paris without a king has as result the world without despots. 

This is the manner in which they reasoned.  Their aim was distant

no doubt, vague perhaps, and it retreated in the face of their efforts;

but it was great.



Thus it is.  And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions,

which are almost always illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions

with which, after all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. 

We throw ourselves into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated

with that which we are about to do.  Who knows?  We may succeed. 

We are few in number, we have a whole army arrayed against us;

but we are defending right, the natural law, the sovereignty

of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible,

justice and truth, and in case of need, we die like the three

hundred Spartans.  We do not think of Don Quixote but of Leonidas. 

And we march straight before us, and once pledged, we do not draw back,

and we rush onwards with head held low, cherishing as our hope an

unprecedented victory, revolution completed, progress set free again,

the aggrandizement of the human race, universal deliverance;

and in the event of the worst, Thermopylae.



These passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck,

and we have just explained why.  The crowd is restive in the

presence of the impulses of paladins.  Heavy masses, the multitudes

which are fragile because of their very weight, fear adventures;

and there is a touch of adventure in the ideal.



Moreover, and we must not forget this, interests which are not

very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way. 

Sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart.



The grandeur and beauty of France lies in this, that she takes

less from the stomach than other nations:  she more easily knots

the rope about her loins.  She is the first awake, the last asleep. 

She marches forwards.  She is a seeker.



This arises from the fact that she is an artist.



The ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic,

the same as the beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true. 

Artistic peoples are also consistent peoples.  To love beauty is

to see the light.  That is why the torch of Europe, that is to say

of civilization, was first borne by Greece, who passed it on to Italy,

who handed it on to France.  Divine, illuminating nations of scouts! 

Vitaelampada tradunt.



It is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element

of its progress.  The amount of civilization is measured by the

quantity of imagination.  Only, a civilizing people should remain

a manly people.  Corinth, yes; Sybaris, no.  Whoever becomes effeminate

makes himself a bastard.  He must be neither a dilettante nor

a virtuoso:  but he must be artistic.  In the matter of civilization,

he must not refine, but he must sublime.  On this condition,

one gives to the human race the pattern of the ideal.



The modern ideal has its type in art, and its means is science. 

It is through science that it will realize that august vision

of the poets, the socially beautiful.  Eden will be reconstructed

by A+B. At the point which civilization has now reached, the exact

is a necessary element of the splendid, and the artistic sentiment

is not only served, but completed by the scientific organ;

dreams must be calculated.  Art, which is the conqueror,

should have for support science, which is the walker; the solidity

of the creature which is ridden is of importance.  The modern spirit

is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as its vehicle;

Alexander on the elephant.



Races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit

to guide civilization.  Genuflection before the idol or before money

wastes away the muscles which walk and the will which advances. 

Hieratic or mercantile absorption lessens a people's power of radiance,

lowers its horizon by lowering its level, and deprives it of that

intelligence, at once both human and divine of the universal goal,

which makes missionaries of nations.  Babylon has no ideal;

Carthage has no ideal.  Athens and Rome have and keep, throughout

all the nocturnal darkness of the centuries, halos of civilization.



France is in the same quality of race as Greece and Italy. 

She is Athenian in the matter of beauty, and Roman in her greatness. 

Moreover, she is good.  She gives herself.  Oftener than is the case

with other races, is she in the humor for self-devotion and sacrifice. 

Only, this humor seizes upon her, and again abandons her. 

And therein lies the great peril for those who run when she

desires only to walk, or who walk on when she desires to halt. 

France has her relapses into materialism, and, at certain instants,

the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything

which recalls French greatness and are of the dimensions of a

Missouri or a South Carolina.  What is to be done in such a case? 

The giantess plays at being a dwarf; immense France has her freaks

of pettiness.  That is all.



To this there is nothing to say.  Peoples, like planets, possess the

right to an eclipse.  And all is well, provided that the light

returns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night. 

Dawn and resurrection are synonymous.  The reappearance of the light

is identical with the persistence of the _I_.



Let us state these facts calmly.  Death on the barricade

or the tomb in exile, is an acceptable occasion for devotion. 

The real name of devotion is disinterestedness.  Let the abandoned

allow themselves to be abandoned, let the exiled allow themselves

to be exiled, and let us confine ourselves to entreating great

nations not to retreat too far, when they do retreat.  One must

not push too far in descent under pretext of a return to reason.



Matter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists;

but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom.  The life of the moment

has its rights, we admit, but permanent life has its rights also. 

Alas! the fact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall. 

This can be seen in history more frequently than is desirable: 

A nation is great, it tastes the ideal, then it bites the mire,

and finds it good; and if it be asked how it happens that it

has abandoned Socrates for Falstaff, it replies:  "Because I

love statesmen."



One word more before returning to our subject, the conflict.



A battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing

else than a convulsion towards the ideal.  Progress trammelled

is sickly, and is subject to these tragic epilepsies.  With that malady

of progress, civil war, we have been obliged to come in contact

in our passage.  This is one of the fatal phases, at once act

and entr'acte of that drama whose pivot is a social condemnation,

and whose veritable title is Progress.



Progress!



The cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought;

and, at the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea

which it contains having still more than one trial to undergo,

it is, perhaps, permitted to us, if not to lift the veil from it,

to at least allow its light to shine through.



The book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is,

from one end to the other, as a whole and in detail, whatever may

be its intermittences, exceptions and faults, the march from evil

to good, from the unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite

to conscience, from rottenness to life, from hell to heaven,

from nothingness to God.  Point of departure:  matter; point of arrival: 

the soul.  The hydra at the beginning, the angel at the end.







CHAPTER XXI



THE HEROES





All at once, the drum beat the charge.



The attack was a hurricane.  On the evening before, in the darkness,

the barricade had been approached silently, as by a boa.  Now, in broad

daylight, in that widening street, surprise was decidedly impossible,

rude force had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun the roar,

the army hurled itself on the barricade.  Fury now became skill. 

A powerful detachment of infantry of the line, broken at regular

intervals, by the National Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot,

and supported by serried masses which could be heard though

not seen, debauched into the street at a run, with drums beating,

trumpets braying, bayonets levelled, the sappers at their head,

and, imperturbable under the projectiles, charged straight

for the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall.



The wall held firm.



The insurgents fired impetuously.  The barricade once scaled

had a mane of lightning flashes.  The assault was so furious,

that for one moment, it was inundated with assailants; but it

shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs, and it

was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam,

to re-appear, a moment later, beetling, black and formidable.



The column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street,

unprotected but terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terrible

discharge of musketry.  Any one who has seen fireworks will recall

the sheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. 

Let the reader picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical

but horizontal, bearing a bullet, buck-shot or a biscaien at the

tip of each one of its jets of flame, and picking off dead men

one after another from its clusters of lightning.  The barricade

was underneath it.



On both sides, the resolution was equal.  The bravery exhibited

there was almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic

ferocity which began by the sacrifice of self.



This was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave. 

The troop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was desirous

of fighting.  The acceptance of the death agony in the flower

of youth and in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. 

In this fray, each one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. 

The street was strewn with corpses.



The barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius at

the other.  Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head,

reserved and sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after

the other, under his embrasure, without having even seen him;

Marius fought unprotected.  He made himself a target.  He stood

with more than half his body above the breastworks.  There is no

more violent prodigal than the avaricious man who takes the bit in

his teeth; there is no man more terrible in action than a dreamer. 

Marius was formidable and pensive.  In battle he was as in a dream. 

One would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in firing a gun.



The insurgents' cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms. 

In this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed.



Courfeyrac was bare-headed.



"What have you done with your hat?"  Bossuet asked him.



Courfeyrac replied:



"They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls."



Or they uttered haughty comments.



"Can any one understand," exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, "those

men,--[and he cited names, well-known names, even celebrated names,

some belonging to the old army]--who had promised to join us,

and taken an oath to aid us, and who had pledged their honor to it,

and who are our generals, and who abandon us!"



And Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile.



"There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes

the stars, from a great distance."



The interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges

that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm.



The assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position. 

They were at the top of a wall, and they thundered point-blank

upon the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled

in the escarpment.  This barricade, constructed as it was and

admirably buttressed, was really one of those situations where a handful

of men hold a legion in check.  Nevertheless, the attacking column,

constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets,

drew inexorably nearer, and now, little by little, step by step,

but surely, the army closed in around the barricade as the vice

grasps the wine-press.



One assault followed another.  The horror of the situation

kept increasing.



Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that

Rue de la Chanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. 

These haggard, ragged, exhausted men, who had had nothing to eat

for four and twenty hours, who had not slept, who had but a few

more rounds to fire, who were fumbling in their pockets which had

been emptied of cartridges, nearly all of whom were wounded,

with head or arm bandaged with black and blood-stained linen,

with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled, and who

were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords, became Titans. 

The barricade was ten times attacked, approached, assailed, scaled,

and never captured.



In order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary to

imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courages, and then to gaze

at the conflagration.  It was not a combat, it was the interior

of a furnace; there mouths breathed the flame; there countenances

were extraordinary.  The human form seemed impossible there,

the combatants flamed forth there, and it was formidable to behold

the going and coming in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray.



The successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we

renounce all attempts at depicting.  The epic alone has the right

to fill twelve thousand verses with a battle.



One would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism,

the most redoubtable of the seventeen abysses,

which the Veda calls the Forest of Swords.



They fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, with blows

of the sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand,

from above, from below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses,

from the windows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows,

whither some had crawled.  They were one against sixty.



The facade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous.  The window,

tattooed with grape-shot, had lost glass and frame and was nothing

now but a shapeless hole, tumultuously blocked with paving-stones.



Bossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed;

Combeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the

breast at the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier,

had only time to cast a glance to heaven when he expired.



Marius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in

the head, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood,

and one would have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief.



Enjolras alone was not struck.  When he had no longer any weapon,

he reached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust

some arm or other into his fist.  All he had left was the stumps

of four swords; one more than Francois I. at Marignan.  Homer says: 

"Diomedes cuts the throat of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt

in happy Arisba; Euryalus, son of Mecistaeus, exterminates Dresos

and Opheltios, Esepius, and that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore

to the blameless Bucolion; Ulysses overthrows Pidytes of Percosius;

Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypaetes, Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene;

and Teucer, Aretaon.  Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus'

pike.  Agamemnon, king of the heroes, flings to earth Elatos,

born in the rocky city which is laved by the sounding river Satnois." 

In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian attacks the giant marquis

Swantibore with a cobbler's shoulder-stick of fire, and the latter

defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucks up

by the roots.  Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes of

Bretagne and Bourbon, armed, emblazoned and crested in war-like guise,

on horseback and approaching each other, their battle-axes in hand,

masked with iron, gloved with iron, booted with iron, the one

caparisoned in ermine, the other draped in azure:  Bretagne with

his lion between the two horns of his crown, Bourbon helmeted with

a monster fleur de lys on his visor.  But, in order to be superb,

it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon, the ducal morion, to have

in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or, like Phyles,

father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a good suit of mail,

a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it suffices to give one's

life for a conviction or a loyalty.  This ingenuous little soldier,

yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who prowls with his clasp-knife

by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourg garden,

this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book,

a blond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,--take both of them,

breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face

in the Carrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray,

and let the one fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal,

and let both of them imagine that they are fighting for their country;

the struggle will be colossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit

and this sawbones in conflict will produce in that grand epic field

where humanity is striving, will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon,

King of Lycia, tiger-filled, crushing in his embrace the immense

body of Ajax, equal to the gods.







CHAPTER XXII



FOOT TO FOOT





When there were no longer any of the leaders left alive,

except Enjolras and Marius at the two extremities of the barricade,

the centre, which had so long sustained Courfeyrac, Joly, Bossuet,

Feuilly and Combeferre, gave way.  The cannon, though it had not

effected a practicable breach, had made a rather large hollow

in the middle of the redoubt; there, the summit of the wall had

disappeared before the balls, and had crumbled away; and the rubbish

which had fallen, now inside, now outside, had, as it accumulated,

formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two sides

of the barrier, one on the inside, the other on the outside. 

The exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack.



A final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. 

The mass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run,

came up with irresistible force, and the serried front of battle

of the attacking column made its appearance through the smoke

on the crest of the battlements.  This time, it was decisive. 

The group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated

in confusion.



Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. 

Many, finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns,

did not wish to die.  This is a moment when the instinct of

self-preservation emits howls, when the beast re-appears in men. 

They were hemmed in by the lofty, six-story house which formed the

background of their redoubt.  This house might prove their salvation. 

The building was barricaded, and walled, as it were, from top to bottom. 

Before the troops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt,

there was time for a door to open and shut, the space of a flash

of lightning was sufficient for that, and the door of that house,

suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly, was life

for these despairing men.  Behind this house, there were streets,

possible flight, space.  They set to knocking at that door with the

butts of their guns, and with kicks, shouting, calling, entreating,

wringing their hands.  No one opened.  From the little window

on the third floor, the head of the dead man gazed down upon them.



But Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them,

sprang forward and protected them.  Enjolras had shouted to

the soldiers:  "Don't advance!" and as an officer had not obeyed,

Enjolras had killed the officer.  He was now in the little inner court

of the redoubt, with his back planted against the Corinthe building,

a sword in one hand, a rifle in the other, holding open the door

of the wine-shop which he barred against assailants.  He shouted

to the desperate men:--"There is but one door open; this one."--

And shielding them with his body, and facing an entire battalion alone,

he made them pass in behind him.  All precipitated themselves thither. 

Enjolras, executing with his rifle, which he now used like a cane,

what single-stick players call a "covered rose" round his head,

levelled the bayonets around and in front of him, and was the last

to enter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when the soldiers tried

to make their way in, and the insurgents strove to bar them out. 

The door was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell back into

its frame, it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been

clinging to it, cut off and glued to the post.



Marius remained outside.  A shot had just broken his collar bone,

he felt that he was fainting and falling.  At that moment, with eyes

already shut, he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him,

and the swoon in which his senses vanished, hardly allowed him time

for the thought, mingled with a last memory of Cosette:--"I am

taken prisoner.  I shall be shot."



Enjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in

the wine-shop, had the same idea.  But they had reached a moment

when each man has not the time to meditate on his own death. 

Enjolras fixed the bar across the door, and bolted it, and double-locked

it with key and chain, while those outside were battering furiously

at it, the soldiers with the butts of their muskets, the sappers

with their axes.  The assailants were grouped about that door. 

The siege of the wine-shop was now beginning.



The soldiers, we will observe, were full of wrath.



The death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then,

a still more melancholy circumstance.  during the few hours which had

preceded the attack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents

were mutilating their prisoners, and that there was the headless body

of a soldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usual

accompaniment of civil wars, and it was a false report of this

kind which, later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain.



When the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others:



"Let us sell our lives dearly."



Then he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. 

Beneath the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible,

one large, the other small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined

beneath the cold folds of the shroud.  A hand projected from beneath

the winding sheet and hung near the floor.  It was that of the

old man.



Enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand, just as he

had kissed his brow on the preceding evening.



These were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course

of his life.



Let us abridge the tale.  The barricade had fought like a gate

of Thebes; the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. 

These resistances are dogged.  No quarter.  No flag of truce possible. 

Men are willing to die, provided their opponent will kill them.



When Suchet says:--"Capitulate,"--Palafox replies:  "After the war

with cannon, the war with knives."  Nothing was lacking in the capture

by assault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining

from the windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating

the soldiers by crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the

attic-windows and the cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally,

when the door yielded, the frenzied madness of extermination. 

The assailants, rushing into the wine-shop, their feet entangled

in the panels of the door which had been beaten in and flung on

the ground, found not a single combatant there.  The spiral staircase,

hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of the tap-room, a few

wounded men were just breathing their last, every one who was not

killed was on the first floor, and from there, through the hole

in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs,

a terrific fire burst forth.  It was the last of their cartridges. 

When they were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point

of death had no longer either powder or ball, each grasped

in his hands two of the bottles which Enjolras had reserved,

and of which we have spoken, and held the scaling party in check

with these frightfully fragile clubs.  They were bottles of aquafortis.



We relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. 

The besieged man, alas! converts everything into a weapon.  Greek fire

did not disgrace Archimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. 

All war is a thing of terror, and there is no choice in it. 

The musketry of the besiegers, though confined and embarrassed by

being directed from below upwards, was deadly.  The rim of the hole

in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain, whence

dripped long, red and smoking streams, the uproar was indescribable;

a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat. 

Words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch. 

There were no longer men in this conflict, which was now infernal. 

They were no longer giants matched with colossi.  It resembled Milton

and Dante rather than Homer.  Demons attacked, spectres resisted.



It was heroism become monstrous.







CHAPTER XXIII



ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK





At length, by dint of mounting on each other's backs,

aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up

the walls, clinging to the ceiling, slashing away at the very brink

of the trap-door, the last one who offered resistance, a score

of assailants, soldiers, National Guardsmen, municipal guardsmen,

in utter confusion, the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during

that redoubtable ascent, blinded by blood, furious, rendered savage,

made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor.  There they

found only one man still on his feet, Enjolras.  Without cartridges,

without sword, he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun

whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering. 

He had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself;

he had retreated into the corner of the room, and there, with haughty eye,

and head borne high, with this stump of a weapon in his hand, he was still

so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him.  A cry arose:



"He is the leader!  It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is

well that he has placed himself there.  Let him remain there. 

Let us shoot him down on the spot."



"Shoot me," said Enjolras.



And flinging away his bit of gun-barrel, and folding his arms,

he offered his breast.



The audacity of a fine death always affects men.  As soon as

Enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end, the din of strife

ceased in the room, and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort

of sepulchral solemnity.  The menacing majesty of Enjolras

disarmed and motionless, appeared to oppress this tumult, and this

young man, haughty, bloody, and charming, who alone had not a wound,

who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being, seemed, by the

authority of his tranquil glance, to constrain this sinister

rabble to kill him respectfully.  His beauty, at that moment

augmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was fresh and rosy

after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed,

as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded.  It was

of him, possibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council

of war:  "There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo." 

A National Guardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, lowered

his gun, saying:  "It seems to me that I am about to shoot a flower."



Twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras,

and silently made ready their guns.



Then a sergeant shouted:



"Take aim!"



An officer intervened.



"Wait."



And addressing Enjolras:



"Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged?"



"No."



"Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?"



"Yes."



Grantaire had waked up a few moments before.



Grantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since the

preceding evening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated

on a chair and leaning on the table.



He realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of "dead drunk." 

The hideous potion of absinthe-porter and alcohol had thrown

him into a lethargy.  His table being small, and not suitable

for the barricade, he had been left in possession of it. 

He was still in the same posture, with his breast bent over

the table, his head lying flat on his arms, surrounded by glasses,

beer-jugs and bottles.  His was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid

bear and the satiated leech.  Nothing had had any effect upon it,

neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor the grape-shot

which had made its way through the window into the room where he was. 

Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault.  He merely replied to

the cannonade, now and then, by a snore.  He seemed to be waiting

there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking. 

Many corpses were strewn around him; and, at the first glance,

there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers

of death.



Noise does not rouse a drunken man; silence awakens him.  The fall

of everything around him only augmented Grantaire's prostration;

the crumbling of all things was his lullaby.  The sort of halt which

the tumult underwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this

heavy slumber.  It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed,

which suddenly comes to a dead stop.  The persons dozing within it

wake up.  Grantaire rose to his feet with a start, stretched out

his arms, rubbed his eyes, stared, yawned, and understood.



A fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which

is torn away.  One beholds, at a single glance and as a whole,

all that it has concealed.  All suddenly presents itself to the memory;

and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place

during the last twenty-four hours, has no sooner opened his eyes than

he is perfectly informed.  Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity;

the obliteration of intoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured

the brain, is dissipated, and makes way for the clear and sharply

outlined importunity of realities.



Relegated, as he was, to one corner, and sheltered behind the

billiard-table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras,

had not even noticed Grantaire, and the sergeant was preparing

to repeat his order:  "Take aim!" when all at once, they heard

a strong voice shout beside them:



"Long live the Republic!  I'm one of them."



Grantaire had risen.  The immense gleam of the whole combat

which he had missed, and in which he had had no part,

appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man.



He repeated:  "Long live the Republic!" crossed the room with a firm

stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras.



"Finish both of us at one blow," said he.



And turning gently to Enjolras, he said to him:



"Do you permit it?"



Enjolras pressed his hand with a smile.



This smile was not ended when the report resounded.



Enjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall,

as though the balls had nailed him there.  Only, his head was bowed.



Grantaire fell at his feet, as though struck by a thunderbolt.



A few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents,

who had taken refuge at the top of the house.  They fired into the

attic through a wooden lattice.  They fought under the very roof. 

They flung bodies, some of them still alive, out through the windows. 

Two light-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered omnibus,

were slain by two shots fired from the attic.  A man in a blouse was

flung down from it, with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, and breathed

his last on the ground.  A soldier and an insurgent slipped together

on the sloping slates of the roof, and, as they would not release

each other, they fell, clasped in a ferocious embrace.  A similar

conflict went on in the cellar.  Shouts, shots, a fierce trampling. 

Then silence.  The barricade was captured.



The soldiers began to search the houses round about, and to pursue

the fugitives.







CHAPTER XXIV



PRISONER





Marius was, in fact, a prisoner.



The hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he

had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness

was that of Jean Valjean.



Jean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose

himself in it.  Had it not been for him, no one, in that supreme

phase of agony, would have thought of the wounded.  Thanks to him,

everywhere present in the carnage, like a providence, those who

fell were picked up, transported to the tap-room, and cared for. 

In the intervals, he reappeared on the barricade.  But nothing

which could resemble a blow, an attack or even personal defence

proceeded from his hands.  He held his peace and lent succor. 

Moreover he had received only a few scratches.  The bullets would

have none of him.  If suicide formed part of what he had meditated

on coming to this sepulchre, to that spot, he had not succeeded. 

But we doubt whether he had thought of suicide, an irreligious act.



Jean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to

see Marius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. 

When a shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the

agility of a tiger, fell upon him as on his prey, and bore him off.



The whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violently

concentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, that

no one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms,

traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind

the angle of the Corinthe building.



The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on

the street; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot,

and all eyes, and a few square feet of space.  There is sometimes

a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration,

and in the midst of raging seas, beyond a promontory or at the

extremity of a blind alley of shoals, a tranquil nook.  It was

in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade,

that Eponine had breathed her last.



There Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground,

placed his back against the wall, and cast his eyes about him.



The situation was alarming.



For an instant, for two or three perhaps, this bit of wall was

a shelter, but how was he to escape from this massacre?  He recalled

the anguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight

years before, and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape;

it was difficult then, to-day it was impossible.  He had before him

that deaf and implacable house, six stories in height, which appeared

to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window;

he had on his right the rather low barricade, which shut off the

Rue de la Petite Truanderie; to pass this obstacle seemed easy,

but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible. 

The troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade. 

It was evident, that to pass the barricade was to go in quest of the

fire of the platoon, and that any head which should run the risk

of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve

as a target for sixty shots.  On his left he had the field of battle. 

Death lurked round the corner of that wall.



What was to be done?



Only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament.



And it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some

expedient, to come to some decision.  Fighting was going on a few

paces away; fortunately, all were raging around a single point,

the door of the wine-shop; but if it should occur to one soldier,

to one single soldier, to turn the corner of the house,

or to attack him on the flank, all was over.



Jean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the

barricade at one side of him, then he looked at the ground,

with the violence of the last extremity, bewildered,

and as though he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes.



By dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an agony

began to assume form and outline at his feet, as though it had

been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold. 

A few paces distant he perceived, at the base of the small barrier

so pitilessly guarded and watched on the exterior, beneath a disordered

mass of paving-stones which partly concealed it, an iron grating,

placed flat and on a level with the soil.  This grating,

made of stout, transverse bars, was about two feet square. 

The frame of paving-stones which supported it had been torn up,

and it was, as it were, unfastened.



Through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture,

something like the flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. 

Jean Valjean darted forward.  His old art of escape rose to his

brain like an illumination.  To thrust aside the stones, to raise

the grating, to lift Marius, who was as inert as a dead body,

upon his shoulders, to descend, with this burden on his loins,

and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort of well,

fortunately not very deep, to let the heavy trap, upon which the

loosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place behind him,

to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below

the surface,--all this was executed like that which one does

in dreams, with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle;

this took only a few minutes.



Jean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious,

in a sort of long, subterranean corridor.



There reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night.



The impression which he had formerly experienced when falling

from the wall into the convent recurred to him.  Only, what he was

carrying to-day was not Cosette; it was Marius.  He could barely

hear the formidable tumult in the wine-shop, taken by assault,

like a vague murmur overhead.
