CHAPTER I



SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED


Cosette's grief, which had been so poignant and lively four or five

months previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact,

entered upon its convalescence.  Nature, spring, youth, love for

her father, the gayety of the birds and flowers, caused something

almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually, drop by drop,

into that soul, which was so virgin and so young.  Was the fire wholly

extinct there?  Or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed? 

The truth is, that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot

any longer.



One day she suddenly thought of Marius:  "Why!" said she, "I no

longer think of him."



That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers,

with a wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl,

a sword under his arm, waxed mustaches, and a glazed schapka,

passing the gate.  Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes,

a round face, was vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse

of Marius.  He had a cigar in his mouth.  Cosette thought that this

officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue

de Babylone.



On the following day, she saw him pass again.  She took note

of the hour.



From that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day.



The officer's comrades perceived that there was, in that "badly kept"

garden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature,

who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,--who is not

unknown to the reader, and whose name was Theodule Gillenormand,--

passed by.



"See here!" they said to him, "there's a little creature there

who is making eyes at you, look."



"Have I the time," replied the lancer, "to look at all the girls

who look at me?"



This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily

towards agony, and was saying:  "If I could but see her before I die!"--

Had his wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment

gazing at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word,

and he would have expired with grief.



Whose fault was it?  No one's.



Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves

in sorrow and there abide; Cosette was one of those persons

who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again.



Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period,

the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself, in which

the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the

vine which cling, as chance directs, to the capital of a marble

column or to the post of a wine-shop: A rapid and decisive moment,

critical for every orphan, be she rich or poor, for wealth does not

prevent a bad choice; misalliances are made in very high circles,

real misalliance is that of souls; and as many an unknown young man,

without name, without birth, without fortune, is a marble column

which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas, so such

and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent, who has polished

boots and varnished words, if looked at not outside, but inside,

a thing which is reserved for his wife, is nothing more than a

block obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous passions;

the post of a drinking-shop.



What did Cosette's soul contain?  Passion calmed or lulled to sleep;

something limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain depth,

and gloomy lower down.  The image of the handsome officer was

reflected in the surface.  Did a souvenir linger in the depths?--

Quite at the bottom?--Possibly.  Cosette did not know.



A singular incident supervened.







CHAPTER II



COSETTE'S APPREHENSIONS





During the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. 

This, as the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very

long intervals.  He remained absent a day or two days at the utmost. 

Where did he go?  No one knew, not even Cosette.  Once only,

on the occasion of one of these departures, she had accompanied him

in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner

of which she read:  Impasse de la Planchette.  There he alighted,

and the coach took Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone.  It was

usually when money was lacking in the house that Jean Valjean took

these little trips.



So Jean Valjean was absent.  He had said:  "I shall return

in three days."



That evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get

rid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun

to sing, accompanying herself the while, the chorus from Euryanthe: 

"Hunters astray in the wood!" which is probably the most beautiful

thing in all the sphere of music.  When she had finished, she remained

wrapped in thought.



All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps

in the garden.



It could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint,

she was in bed, and it was ten o'clock at night.



She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed,

and laid her ear against it.



It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was

walking very softly.



She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber,

opened a small wicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. 

The moon was at the full.  Everything could be seen as plainly as

by day.



There was no one there.



She opened the window.  The garden was absolutely calm, and all

that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual.



Cosette thought that she had been mistaken.  She thought that she

had heard a noise.  It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy

and magnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind

terrified depths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest,

and in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath

the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse

through the twilight.



She thought no more about it.



Moreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature.  There flowed

in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress

who runs barefoot.  It will be remembered that she was more of a lark

than a dove.  There was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her.



On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was

strolling in the garden.  In the midst of the confused thoughts

which occupied her, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound

similar to that of the preceding evening, as though some one were

walking beneath the trees in the dusk, and not very far from her;

but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on

the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side

to side, and she paid no heed to it.  Besides, she could see nothing.



She emerged from "the thicket"; she had still to cross a small lawn

to regain the steps.



The moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette's shadow

in front of her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.



Cosette halted in alarm.



Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf

another shadow, which was particularly startling and terrible,

a shadow which had a round hat.



It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border

of the clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.



She stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call,

or stir, or turn her head.



Then she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.



There was no one there.



She glanced on the ground.  The figure had disappeared.



She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far

as the gate, and found nothing.



She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror.  Was this

another hallucination?  What!  Two days in succession! 

One hallucination might pass, but two hallucinations? 

The disquieting point about it was, that the

shadow had assuredly not been a phantom.  Phantoms do not wear round hats.



On the following day Jean Valjean returned.  Cosette told him what

she thought she had heard and seen.  She wanted to be reassured

and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her: 

"You are a little goose."



Jean Valjean grew anxious.



"It cannot be anything," said he.



He left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she

saw him examining the gate with great attention.



During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she distinctly

heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window. 

She ran to her little wicket and opened it.  In point of fact,

there was a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand. 

Just as she was about to scream, the moon lighted up the man's profile. 

It was her father.  She returned to her bed, saying to herself: 

"He is very uneasy!"



Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights

in the garden.  Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.



On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun

to rise later; at one o'clock in the morning, possibly, she heard

a loud burst of laughter and her father's voice calling her:--



"Cosette!"



She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened

her window.



Her father was standing on the grass-plot below.



"I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you," said he;

"look, there is your shadow with the round hat."



And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon,

and which did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a

man wearing a round hat.  It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe

of sheet iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof.



Cosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions

were allayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast

with her father, she made merry over the sinister garden haunted

by the shadows of iron chimney-pots.



Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette,

she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot

was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen,

or thought she had seen, and whether the moon had been in the same

spot in the sky.



She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot

which is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires

when some one looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken

the alarm when Cosette had turned round, and Cosette had thought

herself very sure of this.  Cosette's serenity was fully restored. 

The proof appeared to her to be complete, and it quite vanished

from her mind, whether there could possibly be any one walking

in the garden during the evening or at night.



A few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred.







CHAPTER III



ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT





In the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,

screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms,

but which could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from

the outside, past the trees and the gate.



One evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had

gone out; Cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. 

The breeze was blowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating;

an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little,

that invincible sadness evoked by the evening, and which arises,

perhaps, who knows, from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at

that hour.



Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow.



Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on

the grass drenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the

species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged: 

"Really, one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour. 

One takes cold."



She returned to the bench.



As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the

spot which she had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had,

evidently, not been there a moment before.



Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant.  All at once

the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench

all by itself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been

thrust through the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. 

This time, the fear was genuine; the stone was there.  No doubt

was possible; she did not touch it, fled without glancing behind her,

took refuge in the house, and immediately closed with shutter,

bolt, and bar the door-like window opening on the flight of steps. 

She inquired of Toussaint:--



"Has my father returned yet?"



"Not yet, Mademoiselle."



[We have already noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered. 

May we be permitted to dispense with it for the future.  The musical

notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us.]



Jean Valjean, a thoughtful man, and given to nocturnal strolls,

often returned quite late at night.



"Toussaint," went on Cosette, "are you careful to thoroughly

barricade the shutters opening on the garden, at least with bars,

in the evening, and to put the little iron things in the little

rings that close them?"



"Oh! be easy on that score, Miss."



Toussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well aware

of the fact, but she could not refrain from adding:--



"It is so solitary here."



"So far as that is concerned," said Toussaint, "it is true. 

We might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf! 

And Monsieur does not sleep in the house, to boot. 

But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the shutters up like prisons. 

Lone women!  That is enough to make one shudder, I believe you! 

Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter your chamber at

night and say:  `Hold your tongue!' and begin to cut your throat. 

It's not the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and that's

all right; it's the abomination of feeling those people touch you. 

And then, their knives; they can't be able to cut well with them! 

Ah, good gracious!"



"Be quiet," said Cosette.  "Fasten everything thoroughly."



Cosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint,

and possibly, also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the

past week, which recurred to her memory, dared not even say to her: 

"Go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench!"

for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing "the men" to enter. 

She saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened,

made Toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar, locked herself

up in her own chamber, bolted her door, looked under her couch,

went to bed and slept badly.  All night long she saw that big stone,

as large as a mountain and full of caverns.



At sunrise,--the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh

at all our terrors of the past night, and our laughter is in direct

proportion to our terror which they have caused,--at sunrise Cosette,

when she woke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, and said to herself: 

"What have I been thinking of?  It is like the footsteps that I

thought I heard a week or two ago in the garden at night! 

It is like the shadow of the chimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?" 

The sun, which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters,

and turning the damask curtains crimson, reassured her to such an extent

that everything vanished from her thoughts, even the stone.



"There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round

hat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest."



She dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench,

and broke out in a cold perspiration.  The stone was there.



But this lasted only for a moment.  That which is terror by night

is curiosity by day.



"Bah!" said she, "come, let us see what it is."



She lifted the stone, which was tolerably large.  Beneath it was

something which resembled a letter.  It was a white envelope. 

Cosette seized it.  There was no address on one side, no seal

on the other.  Yet the envelope, though unsealed, was not empty. 

Papers could be seen inside.



Cosette examined it.  It was no longer alarm, it was no longer curiosity;

it was a beginning of anxiety.



Cosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook

of paper, each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines

in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought.



Cosette looked for a name; there was none.  To whom was this addressed? 

To her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench. 

From whom did it come?  An irresistible fascination took possession

of her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were

trembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias

all bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof,

and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said

to herself that she must know what it contained.



This is what she read.







CHAPTER IV



A HEART BENEATH A STONE





The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion

of a single being even to God, that is love.





Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars.





How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!





What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills

the world!  Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. 

One could comprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God

the Father of all evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul

for love.





The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac

curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace

of dreams.





God is behind everything, but everything

hides God.  Things are black, creatures

are opaque.  To love a being is to render that being transparent.





Certain thoughts are prayers.  There are moments when, whatever the

attitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.





Parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices,

which possess, however, a reality of their own.  They are

prevented from seeing each other, they cannot write to each other;

they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond. 

They send each other the song of the birds, the perfume of the flowers,

the smiles of children, the light of the sun, the sighings

of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation.  And why not? 

All the works of God are made to serve love.  Love is sufficiently

potent to charge all nature with its messages.



Oh Spring!  Thou art a letter that I write to her.





The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. 

Love, that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. 

In the infinite, the inexhaustible is requisite.





Love participates of the soul itself.  It is of the same nature. 

Like it, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible,

indivisible, imperishable.  It is a point of fire that exists

within us, which is immortal and infinite, which nothing can confine,

and which nothing can extinguish.  We feel it burning even to the

very marrow of our bones, and we see it beaming in the very depths

of heaven.





Oh Love!  Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand each

other, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances which

penetrate each other!  You will come to me, will you not, bliss! strolls

by twos in the solitudes!  Blessed and radiant days!  I have sometimes

dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the

lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men.





God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to give

them endless duration.  After a life of love, an eternity of love is,

in fact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the

ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world,

is impossible, even to God.  God is the plenitude of heaven;

love is the plenitude of man.





You look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous,

and because it is impenetrable.  You have beside you a sweeter

radiance and a greater mystery, woman.





All of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings.  We lack air

and we stifle.  Then we die.  To die for lack of love is horrible. 

Suffocation of the soul.





When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred

and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered

so far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything

more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they

are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit.  Love, soar.





On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks,

you are lost, you love.  But one thing remains for you to do: 

to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.





What love commences can be finished by God alone.





True love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost

or a handkerchief found, and eternity is required for its

devotion and its hopes.  It is composed both of the infinitely

great and the infinitely little.





If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the

sensitive plant; if you are a man, be love.





Nothing suffices for love.  We have happiness, we desire paradise;

we possess paradise, we desire heaven.



Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. 

Understand how to find it there.  Love has contemplation as well

as heaven, and more than heaven, it has voluptuousness.





"Does she still come to the Luxembourg?"  "No, sir."  "This is the church

where she attends mass, is it not?"  "She no longer comes here." 

"Does she still live in this house?"  "She has moved away." 

"Where has she gone to dwell?"



"She did not say."



What a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul!



Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. 

Shame on the passions which belittle man!  Honor to the one which

makes a child of him!





There is one strange thing, do you know it?  I dwell in the night. 

There is a being who carried off my sky when she went away.





Oh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave,

hand in hand, and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing

a finger,--that would suffice for my eternity!





Ye who suffer because ye love, love yet more.  To die of love,

is to live in it.





Love.  A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture. 

There is ecstasy in agony.





Oh joy of the birds!  It is because they have nests that they sing.





Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.





Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a

long trial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. 

This destiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step

inside the tomb.  Then something appears to him, and he begins to

distinguish the definitive.  The definitive, meditate upon that word. 

The living perceive the infinite; the definitive permits itself

to be seen only by the dead.  In the meanwhile, love and suffer,

hope and contemplate.  Woe, alas! to him who shall have loved

only bodies, forms, appearances!  Death will deprive him of all. 

Try to love souls, you will find them again.





I encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. 

His hat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes;

water trickled through his shoes, and the stars through his soul.





What a grand thing it is to be loved!  What a far grander thing

it is to love!  The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. 

It is no longer composed of anything but what is pure; it no longer

rests on anything that is not elevated and great.  An unworthy

thought can no more germinate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. 

The serene and lofty soul, inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions,

dominating the clouds and the shades of this world, its follies,

its lies, its hatreds, its vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue

of heaven, and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean

shocks of destiny, as the crests of mountains feel the shocks

of earthquake.





If there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct.







CHAPTER V



COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER





As Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought.  At the very moment

when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book,

the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,--

it was his hour; Cosette thought him hideous.



She resumed her contemplation of the book.  It was written in the

most charming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand,

but with divers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish,

as when ink has been added to the inkstand, and consequently on

different days.  It was, then, a mind which had unfolded itself there,

sigh by sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice,

without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never read anything like it. 

This manuscript, in which she already perceived more light than

obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. 

Each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated

her heart with a strange radiance.  The education which she had

received had always talked to her of the soul, and never of love,

very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame. 

This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed

to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning,

the end.  It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon

her a handful of rays of light.  In these few lines she felt

a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will,

an immense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart,

an ecstasy fully expanded.  What was this manuscript?  A letter. 

A letter without name, without address, without date, without signature,

pressing and disinterested, an enigma composed of truths, a message

of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin,

an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of

a phantom to a shade.  It was an absent one, tranquil and dejected,

who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love,

his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love.  This had been

written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven. 

These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what

might be called drops of soul.



Now, from whom could these pages come?  Who could have penned them?



Cosette did not hesitate a moment.  One man only.



He!



Day had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. 

She felt an unheard-of joy, and a profound anguish.  It was he! he

who had written! he was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust

through that railing!  While she was forgetful of him, he had found

her again!  But had she forgotten him?  No, never!  She was foolish

to have thought so for a single moment.  She had always loved him,

always adored him.  The fire had been smothered, and had smouldered

for a time, but she saw all plainly now; it had but made headway,

and now it had burst forth afresh, and had inflamed her whole being. 

This note-book was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul

into hers.  She felt the conflagration starting up once more.



She imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: 

"Oh yes!" said she, "how perfectly I recognize all that!  That is

what I had already read in his eyes."  As she was finishing it

for the third time, Lieutenant Theodule passed the gate once more,

and rattled his spurs upon the pavement.  Cosette was forced

to raise her eyes.  She thought him insipid, silly, stupid,

useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent, and extremely ugly. 

The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.



She turned away as in shame and indignation.  She would gladly

have thrown something at his head.



She fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her

chamber to peruse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart,

and to dream.  When she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed

it and put it in her bosom.



All was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. 

The abyss of Eden had yawned once more.



All day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. 

She scarcely thought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled

skein in her brain, she could not manage to conjecture anything,

she hoped through a tremor, what? vague things.  She dared make

herself no promises, and she did not wish to refuse herself anything. 

Flashes of pallor passed over her countenance, and shivers ran through

her frame.  It seemed to her, at intervals, that she was entering

the land of chimaeras; she said to herself:  "Is this reality?" 

Then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown,

she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles against her flesh;

and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he would have shuddered

in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy, which overflowed

from beneath her eyelids.--"Oh yes!" she thought, "it is certainly he! 

This comes from him, and is for me!"



And she told herself that an intervention of the angels,

a celestial chance, had given him back to her.



Oh transfiguration of love!  Oh dreams!  That celestial chance,

that intervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed

by one thief to another thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard

to the Lion's Ditch, over the roofs of La Force.







CHAPTER VI



OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELY





When evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed herself. 

She arranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on

a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much,

and which, through this slope, permitted a view of the beginning

of her throat, and was, as young girls say, "a trifle indecent." 

It was not in the least indecent, but it was prettier than usual. 

She made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so.



Did she mean to go out?  No.



Was she expecting a visitor?  No.



At dusk, she went down to the garden.  Toussaint was busy

in her kitchen, which opened on the back yard.



She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside

the branches from time to time with her hand, because there

were some which hung very low.



In this manner she reached the bench.



The stone was still there.



She sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though

she wished to caress and thank it.



All at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which one

undergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she

does not see the person.



She turned her head and rose to her feet.



It was he.



His head was bare.  He appeared to have grown thin and pale. 

His black clothes were hardly discernible.  The twilight threw

a wan light on his fine brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. 

Beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness, he had something about

him that suggested death and night.  His face was illuminated

by the light of the dying day, and by the thought of a soul that is

taking flight.



He seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.



He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.



Cosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry.  She retreated slowly,

for she felt herself attracted.  He did not stir.  By virtue

of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him,

she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see.



Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. 

Had it not been for this tree, she would have fallen.



Then she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard,

barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:--



"Pardon me, here I am.  My heart is full.  I could not live on as I

was living, and I have come.  Have you read what I placed there

on the bench?  Do you recognize me at all?  Have no fear of me. 

It is a long time, you remember the day, since you looked at me

at the Luxembourg, near the Gladiator.  And the day when you passed

before me?  It was on the 16th of June and the 2d of July.  It is nearly

a year ago.  I have not seen you for a long time.  I inquired of the

woman who let the chairs, and she told me that she no longer saw you. 

You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on the third floor, in the front

apartments of a new house,--you see that I know!  I followed you. 

What else was there for me to do?  And then you disappeared. 

I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading the newspapers

under the arcade of the Odeon.  I ran after you.  But no.  It was

a person who had a bonnet like yours.  At night I came hither. 

Do not be afraid, no one sees me.  I come to gaze upon your windows

near at hand.  I walk very softly, so that you may not hear,

for you might be alarmed.  The other evening I was behind you,

you turned round, I fled.  Once, I heard you singing.  I was happy. 

Did it affect you because I heard you singing through the shutters? 

That could not hurt you.  No, it is not so?  You see, you are

my angel!  Let me come sometimes; I think that I am going to die. 

If you only knew!  I adore you.  Forgive me, I speak to you, but I

do not know what I am saying; I may have displeased you; have I

displeased you?"



"Oh! my mother!" said she.



And she sank down as though on the point of death.



He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close,

without knowing what he was doing.  He supported her, though he was

tottering himself.  It was as though his brain were full of smoke;

lightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed

to him that he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he

was committing a profanation.  Moreover, he had not the least passion

for this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast. 

He was beside himself with love.



She took his hand and laid it on her heart.  He felt the paper there,

he stammered:--



"You love me, then?"



She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more

than a barely audible breath:--



"Hush!  Thou knowest it!"



And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb

and intoxicated young man.



He fell upon the bench, and she beside him.  They had no words more. 

The stars were beginning to gleam.  How did it come to pass that their

lips met?  How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts,

that the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white

behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills?



A kiss, and that was all.



Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.



They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the

damp earth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their

hearts were full of thoughts.  They had clasped hands unconsciously.



She did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there,

and how he had made his way into the garden.  It seemed so simple

to her that he should be there!



From time to time, Marius' knee touched Cosette's knee, and both shivered.



At intervals, Cosette stammered a word.  Her soul fluttered

on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower.



Little by little they began to talk to each other.  Effusion followed

silence, which is fulness.  The night was serene and splendid overhead. 

These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything,

their dreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimaeras,

their weaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar,

how they had longed for each other, their despair when they

had ceased to see each other.  They confided to each other in an

ideal intimacy, which nothing could augment, their most secret and

most mysterious thoughts.  They related to each other, with candid

faith in their illusions, all that love, youth, and the remains of

childhood which still lingered about them, suggested to their minds. 

Their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise,

that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was the young

man who had the young girl's soul, and the young girl who had

the young man's soul.  Each became permeated with the other,

they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other.



When they had finished, when they had told each other everything,

she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him:--



"What is your name?"



"My name is Marius," said he.  "And yours?"



"My name is Cosette."
