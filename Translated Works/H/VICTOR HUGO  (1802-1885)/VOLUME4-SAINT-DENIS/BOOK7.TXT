CHAPTER I


ORIGIN


Pigritia is a terrible word.



It engenders a whole world, la pegre, for which read theft,

and a hell, la pegrenne, for which read hunger.



Thus, idleness is the mother.



She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.



Where are we at this moment?  In the land of slang.



What is slang?  It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect;

it is theft in its two kinds; people and language.



When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave

and sombre history introduced into a work written with the same

aim as this[39] a thief who talked argot, there arose amazement

and clamor.--"What! How!  Argot!  Why, argot is horrible! 

It is the language of prisons, galleys, convicts, of everything

that is most abominable in society!" etc., etc.





[39] The Last Day of a Condemned Man.





We have never understood this sort of objections.



Since that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound

observer of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of

the people, Balzac and Eugene Sue, having represented their ruffians

as talking their natural language, as the author of The Last Day

of a Condemned Man did in 1828, the same objections have been raised. 

People repeated:  "What do authors mean by that revolting dialect? 

Slang is odious!  Slang makes one shudder!"



Who denies that?  Of course it does.



When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society,

since when has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go

to the bottom?  We have always thought that it was sometimes a

courageous act, and, at least, a simple and useful deed, worthy of

the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits. 

Why should one not explore everything, and study everything? 

Why should one halt on the way?  The halt is a matter depending

on the sounding-line, and not on the leadsman.



Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to

undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order,

where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage

in those vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to fling,

still quivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping

with filth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary

each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire

and the shadows.  Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation

thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible

swarming of slang.  It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast

made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool. 

One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket

which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares. 

One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye,

such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab. 

All this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been

organized out of disorganization.



Now, when has horror ever excluded study?  Since when has malady

banished medicine?  Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study

the viper, the bat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula,

and one who would cast them back into their darkness, saying:  "Oh! how

ugly that is!"  The thinker who should turn aside from slang would

resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart. 

He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language,

a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. 

For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case,

that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result. 

What is slang, properly speaking?  It is the language of wretchedness.



We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms,

which is one way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades,

professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social

hierarchy and all forms of intelligence, have their own slang. 

The merchant who says:  "Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality,"

the broker on 'change who says:  "Assets at end of current month,"

the gambler who says:  "Tiers et tout, refait de pique," the sheriff

of the Norman Isles who says:  The holder in fee reverting to his landed

estate cannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary

seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor," the playwright who says: 

"The piece was hissed," the comedian who says:  "I've made a hit,"

the philosopher who says:  "Phenomenal triplicity," the huntsman

who says:  "Voileci allais, Voileci fuyant," the phrenologist

who says:  "Amativeness, combativeness, secretiveness," the infantry

soldier who says:  "My shooting-iron," the cavalry-man who says: 

"My turkey-cock," the fencing-master who says:  "Tierce, quarte, break,"

the printer who says:  "My shooting-stick and galley,"--all, printer,

fencing-master, cavalry dragoon, infantry-man, phrenologist,

huntsman, philosopher, comedian, playwright, sheriff, gambler,

stock-broker, and merchant, speak slang.  The painter who says: 

"My grinder," the notary who says:  "My Skip-the-Gutter,"

the hairdresser who says:  "My mealyback," the cobbler who says: 

"My cub," talks slang.  Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on

the point, all the different fashions of saying the right and the left,

the sailor's port and starboard, the scene-shifter's court-side, and

garden-side, the beadle's Gospel-side and Epistle-side, are slang. 

There is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses. 

The Hotel Rambouillet nearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles.  There is

a slang of duchesses, witness this phrase contained in a love-letter

from a very great lady and a very pretty woman of the Restoration: 

"You will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why I should

libertize."[40] Diplomatic ciphers are slang; the pontifical

chancellery by using 26 for Rome, grkztntgzyal for despatch,

and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI.  for the Due de Modena, speaks slang. 

The physicians of the Middle Ages who, for carrot, radish, and turnip,

said Opoponach, perfroschinum, reptitalmus, dracatholicum, angelorum,

postmegorum, talked slang.  The sugar-manufacturer who says: 

"Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,"--this honest

manufacturer talks slang.  A certain school of criticism twenty years ago,

which used to say:  "Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays

upon words and puns,"--talked slang.  The poet, and the artist who,

with profound understanding, would designate M. de Montmorency

as "a bourgeois," if he were not a judge of verses and statues,

speak slang.  The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits,

"Pomona," the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms," a horse,

"a courser," the white or tricolored cockade, "the rose of Bellona,"

the three-cornered hat, "Mars' triangle,"--that classical Academician

talks slang.  Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang. 

The tongue which is employed on board ship, that wonderful language

of the sea, which is so complete and so picturesque, which was spoken

by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperre, which mingles with

the whistling of the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets,

the shock of the boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind,

the gale, the cannon, is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which

is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal.





[40] "Vous trouverez dans ces potains-la, une foultitude de raisons

pour que je me libertise."





No doubt.  But say what we will, this manner of understanding

the word slang is an extension which every one will not admit. 

For our part, we reserve to the word its ancient and precise,

circumscribed and determined significance, and we restrict slang

to slang.  The veritable slang and the slang that is pre-eminently

slang, if the two words can be coupled thus, the slang immemorial

which was a kingdom, is nothing else, we repeat, than the homely,

uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous, cruel, equivocal, vile, profound,

fatal tongue of wretchedness.  There exists, at the extremity of all

abasement and all misfortunes, a last misery which revolts and makes

up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate

facts and reigning rights; a fearful conflict, where, now cunning,

now violent, unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time,

it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice, and with

club-blows through crime.  To meet the needs of this conflict,

wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is slang.



To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf,

were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and

which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements,

good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it

is complicated, to extend the records of social observation;

is to serve civilization itself.  This service Plautus rendered,

consciously or unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers

talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered, by making so many

of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects. 

Here objections spring up afresh.  Phoenician, very good! 

Levantine, quite right!  Even dialect, let that pass!  They are

tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang! 

What is the use of preserving slang?  What is the good of assisting

slang "to survive"?



To this we reply in one word, only.  Assuredly, if the tongue

which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest,

the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy

of attention and study.



It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example,

for more than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every

possible human misery.



And then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities

and infirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view

to remedy, is not a business in which choice is permitted. 

The historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than

the historian of events.  The latter has the surface of civilization,

the conflicts of crowns, the births of princes, the marriages of kings,

battles, assemblages, great public men, revolutions in the daylight,

everything on the exterior; the other historian has the interior,

the depths, the people who toil, suffer, wait, the oppressed woman,

the agonizing child, the secret war between man and man,

obscure ferocities, prejudices, plotted iniquities, the subterranean,

the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the die-of-hunger,

the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of souls,

the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans,

the unhappy, and the infamous, all the forms which roam through

the darkness.  He must descend with his heart full of charity,

and severity at the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to those

impenetrable casemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed

and those who deal the blow, those who weep and those who curse,

those who fast and those who devour, those who endure evil and those

who inflict it.  Have these historians of hearts and souls duties

at all inferior to the historians of external facts?  Does any one

think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli? 

Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper

side merely because it is deeper and more sombre?  Do we really

know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern?



Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words

of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between

the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind. 

No one is a good historian of the patent, visible, striking,

and public life of peoples, if he is not, at the same time,

in a certain measure, the historian of their deep and hidden life;

and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he

understands how, at need, to be the historian of the exterior also. 

The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events,

and this is true reciprocally.  They constitute two different orders

of facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced,

and which often bring forth results.  All the lineaments which

providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels,

sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the

depths produce ebullitions on the surface.  True history being

a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.



Man is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with

a double focus.  Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.



Slang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having some

bad action to perform, disguises itself.  There it clothes itself

in word-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible.



One finds it difficult to recognize.  Is it really the French tongue,

the great human tongue?  Behold it ready to step upon the stage

and to retort upon crime, and prepared for all the employments

of the repertory of evil.  It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps

on the crutch of the Court of Miracles, a crutch metamorphosable

into a club; it is called vagrancy; every sort of spectre,

its dressers, have painted its face, it crawls and rears, the double

gait of the reptile.  Henceforth, it is apt at all roles, it is made

suspicious by the counterfeiter, covered with verdigris by the forger,

blacked by the soot of the incendiary; and the murderer applies its rouge.



When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society,

one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. 

One distinguishes questions and replies.  One perceives, without

understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents,

but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. 

It is slang.  The words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable

and fantastic bestiality.  One thinks one hears hydras talking.



It is unintelligible in the dark.  It gnashes and whispers,

completing the gloom with mystery.  It is black in misfortune,

it is blacker still in crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated,

compose slang.  Obscurity in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts,

obscurity in voices.  Terrible, toad-like tongue which goes

and comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, and stirs about in monstrous

wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night, of hunger,

of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity, of suffocation,

and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.



Let us have compassion on the chastised.  Alas!  Who are we ourselves? 

Who am I who now address you?  Who are you who are listening to me? 

And are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born? 

The earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail.  Who knows

whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice? 

Look closely at life.  It is so made, that everywhere we feel the sense

of punishment.



Are you what is called a happy man?  Well! you are sad every day. 

Each day has its own great grief or its little care.  Yesterday you

were trembling for a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear

for your own; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day

after to-morrow the diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that,

the misfortune of some friend; then the prevailing weather, then something

that has been broken or lost, then a pleasure with which your

conscience and your vertebral column reproach you; again, the course

of public affairs.  This without reckoning in the pains of the heart. 

And so it goes on.  One cloud is dispelled, another forms. 

There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous

and sunny.  And you belong to that small class who are happy! 

As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.



Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase:  the fortunate

and the unfortunate.  In this world, evidently the vestibule

of another, there are no fortunate.



The real human division is this:  the luminous and the shady. 

To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number

of the luminous,--that is the object.  That is why we cry: 

Education! science!  To teach reading, means to light the fire;

every syllable spelled out sparkles.



However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. 

People suffer in the light; excess burns.  The flame is the enemy

of the wing.  To burn without ceasing to fly,--therein lies the

marvel of genius.



When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will

still suffer.  The day is born in tears.  The luminous weep,

if only over those in darkness.







CHAPTER II



ROOTS





Slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness.



Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy

is bidden to its most poignant meditations, in the presence

of that enigmatic dialect at once so blighted and rebellious. 

Therein lies chastisement made visible.  Every syllable has

an air of being marked.  The words of the vulgar tongue appear

therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were, beneath the hot iron

of the executioner.  Some seem to be still smoking.  Such and such

a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief

branded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare. 

Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which

are fugitives from justice.  Metaphor is sometimes so shameless,

that one feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.



Moreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strange

dialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial

case of pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing

as well as for the gold medal, and which is called literature. 

Slang, whether the public admit the fact or not has its syntax

and its poetry.  It is a language.  Yes, by the deformity of

certain terms, we recognize the fact that it was chewed by Mandrin,

and by the splendor of certain metonymies, we feel that Villon spoke it.



That exquisite and celebrated verse--



          Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?

          But where are the snows of years gone by?



is a verse of slang.  Antam--ante annum--is a word of Thunes slang,

which signified the past year, and by extension, formerly. 

Thirty-five years ago, at the epoch of the departure of the great

chain-gang, there could be read in one of the cells at Bicetre,

this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of Thunes

condemned to the galleys:  Les dabs d'antan trimaient siempre pour

la pierre du Coesre.  This means Kings in days gone by always

went and had themselves anointed.  In the opinion of that king,

anointment meant the galleys.



The word decarade, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles

at a gallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is worthy of him. 

This word, which strikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a

masterly onomatopoeia the whole of La Fontaine's admirable verse:--



          Six forts chevaux tiraient un coche.

          Six stout horses drew a coach.





From a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove more

curious and fruitful than the study of slang.  It is a whole language

within a language, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft

which has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots

in the old Gallic trunk, and whose sinister foliage crawls all over

one side of the language.  This is what may be called the first,

the vulgar aspect of slang.  But, for those who study the tongue as it

should be studied, that is to say, as geologists study the earth,

slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit.  According as one digs

a longer or shorter distance into it, one finds in slang, below the old

popular French, Provencal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language

of the Mediterranean ports, English and German, the Romance language

in its three varieties, French, Italian, and Romance Romance, Latin,

and finally Basque and Celtic.  A profound and unique formation. 

A subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable. 

Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering has

dropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its pebble. 

A throng of evil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversed

life and have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely

visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word.



Do you want Spanish?  The old Gothic slang abounded in it. 

Here is boffete, a box on the ear, which is derived from bofeton;

vantane, window (later on vanterne), which comes from vantana;

gat, cat, which comes from gato; acite, oil, which comes from aceyte. 

Do you want Italian?  Here is spade, sword, which comes from spada;

carvel, boat, which comes from caravella.  Do you want English? 

Here is bichot, which comes from bishop; raille, spy, which comes from

rascal, rascalion; pilche, a case, which comes from pilcher, a sheath. 

Do you want German?  Here is the caleur, the waiter, kellner; the hers,

the master, herzog (duke). Do you want Latin?  Here is frangir,

to break, frangere; affurer, to steal, fur; cadene, chain, catena. 

There is one word which crops up in every language of the continent,

with a sort of mysterious power and authority.  It is the word magnus;

the Scotchman makes of it his mac, which designates the chief

of the clan; Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the great Farlane,

the great Callumore[41]; slang turns it into meck and later le meg,

that is to say, God.  Would you like Basque?  Here is gahisto,

the devil, which comes from gaiztoa, evil; sorgabon, good night,

which comes from gabon, good evening.  Do you want Celtic? 

Here is blavin, a handkerchief, which comes from blavet, gushing water;

menesse, a woman (in a bad sense), which comes from meinec, full

of stones; barant, brook, from baranton, fountain; goffeur, locksmith,

from goff, blacksmith; guedouze, death, which comes from guenn-du,

black-white. Finally, would you like history?  Slang calls crowns les

malteses, a souvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta.





[41] It must be observed, however, that mac in Celtic means son.





In addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possesses

other and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak,

from the mind of man itself.



In the first place, the direct creation of words.  Therein lies

the mystery of tongues.  To paint with words, which contains

figures one knows not how or why, is the primitive foundation

of all human languages, what may be called their granite.



Slang abounds in words of this description, immediate words,

words created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom,

without etymology, without analogies, without derivatives, solitary,

barbarous, sometimes hideous words, which at times possess a singular

power of expression and which live.  The executioner, le taule;

the forest, le sabri; fear, flight, taf; the lackey, le larbin;

the mineral, the prefect, the minister, pharos; the devil, le rabouin. 

Nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal. 

Some, le rabouin, for example, are at the same time grotesque

and terrible, and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace.



ln the second place, metaphor.  The peculiarity of a language which

is desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich

in figures.  Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting

a stroke, the prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. 

No idiom is more metaphorical than slang:  devisser le coco (to

unscrew the nut), to twist the neck; tortiller (to wriggle), to eat;

etre gerbe, to be tried; a rat, a bread thief; il lansquine, it rains,

a striking, ancient figure which partly bears its date about it,

which assimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense and

slanting pikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a single word

the popular expression:  it rains halberds.  Sometimes, in proportion

as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second, words pass

from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense. 

The devil ceases to be le rabouin, and becomes le boulanger (the

baker), who puts the bread into the oven.  This is more witty,

but less grand, something like Racine after Corneille, like Euripides

after AEschylus.  Certain slang phrases which participate in the two

epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical

character resemble phantasmagories.  Les sorgueuers vont solliciter

des gails a la lune--the prowlers are going to steal horses by night,--

this passes before the mind like a group of spectres.  One knows not

what one sees.



In the third place, the expedient.  Slang lives on the language. 

It uses it in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard,

and it often confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it

in a gross and summary fashion.  Occasionally, with the ordinary

words thus deformed and complicated with words of pure slang,

picturesque phrases are formed, in which there can be felt the mixture

of the two preceding elements, the direct creation and the metaphor: 

le cab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri,

the dog is barking, I suspect that the diligence for Paris is passing

through the woods.  Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussiere,

la fee est bative, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning,

the daughter is pretty.  Generally, to throw listeners off the track,

slang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language

without distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in aille,

in orgue, in iergue, or in uche.  Thus:  Vousiergue trouvaille

bonorgue ce gigotmuche?  Do you think that leg of mutton good? 

A phrase addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out

whether the sum offered for his escape suited him.



The termination in mar has been added recently.



Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted itself. 

Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as it feels

that it is understood, it changes its form.  Contrary to what happens

with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls upon

it kills whatever it touches.  Thus slang is in constant process

of decomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which

never pauses.  It passes over more ground in ten years than a language

in ten centuries.  Thus le larton (bread) becomes le lartif; le gail

(horse) becomes le gaye; la fertanche (straw) becomes la fertille;

le momignard (brat), le momacque; les fiques (duds), frusques;

la chique (the church), l'egrugeoir; le colabre (neck), le colas. 

The devil is at first, gahisto, then le rabouin, then the baker;

the priest is a ratichon, then the boar (le sanglier); the dagger is

le vingt-deux (twenty-two), then le surin, then le lingre; the police

are railles, then roussins, then rousses, then marchands de lacets

(dealers in stay-laces), then coquers, then cognes; the executioner

is le taule, then Charlot, l'atigeur, then le becquillard. 

In the seventeenth century, to fight was "to give each other snuff";

in the nineteenth it is "to chew each other's throats." 

There have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes. 

Cartouche's talk would have been Hebrew to Lacenaire.  All the words

of this language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men

who utter them.



Still, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement,

the ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more.  It has

its headquarters where it maintains its sway.  The Temple preserved

the slang of the seventeenth century; Bicetre, when it was a prison,

preserved the slang of Thunes.  There one could hear the termination

in anche of the old Thuneurs.  Boyanches-tu (bois-tu), do you drink? 

But perpetual movement remains its law, nevertheless.



If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes

of observation, this language which is incessantly evaporating,

he falls into doleful and useful meditation.  No study is more

efficacious and more fecund in instruction.  There is not a metaphor,

not an analogy, in slang, which does not contain a lesson. 

Among these men, to beat means to feign; one beats a malady;

ruse is their strength.



For them, the idea of the man is not separated from the idea

of darkness.  The night is called la sorgue; man, l'orgue. Man

is a derivative of the night.



They have taken up the practice of considering society in the

light of an atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force,

and they speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health. 

A man under arrest is a sick man; one who is condemned is a dead man.



The most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls

in which he is buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, and he calls

the dungeon the castus.  In that funereal place, life outside

always presents itself under its most smiling aspect.  The prisoner

has irons on his feet; you think, perhaps, that his thought

is that it is with the feet that one walks?  No; he is thinking

that it is with the feet that one dances; so, when he has succeeded

in severing his fetters, his first idea is that now he can dance,

and he calls the saw the bastringue (public-house ball).--A name

is a centre; profound assimilation.--The ruffian has two heads,

one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life long,

and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death;

he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne,

and the head which expiates it la tronche.--When a man has no

longer anything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart,

when he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation

which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations,

he is ripe for crime; he is like a well-whetted knife; he has

two cutting edges, his distress and his malice; so slang does

not say a blackguard, it says un reguise.--What are the galleys? 

A brazier of damnation, a hell.  The convict calls himself a fagot.--

And finally, what name do malefactors give to their prison? 

The college.  A whole penitentiary system can be evolved from

that word.



Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of

the galleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa,

have had their birth?



Let him listen to what follows:--



There existed at the Chatelet in Paris a large and long cellar. 

This cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine.  It had

neither windows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door;

men could enter there, air could not.  This vault had for ceiling

a vault of stone, and for floor ten inches of mud.  It was flagged;

but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water. 

Eight feet above the floor, a long and massive beam traversed this

subterranean excavation from side to side; from this beam hung,

at short distances apart, chains three feet long, and at the end

of these chains there were rings for the neck.  In this vault,

men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the

day of their departure for Toulon.  They were thrust under this beam,

where each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting

for him.



The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands,

caught the unhappy wretches by the throat.  They were rivetted and

left there.  As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. 

They remained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath

that beam, almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach

their bread, jug, or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg,

filth flowing to their very calves, broken asunder with fatigue,

with thighs and knees giving way, clinging fast to the chain with

their hands in order to obtain some rest, unable to sleep except

when standing erect, and awakened every moment by the strangling

of the collar; some woke no more.  In order to eat, they pushed

the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along their leg

with their heel until it reached their hand.



How long did they remain thus?  One month, two months, six months

sometimes; one stayed a year.  It was the antechamber of the galleys. 

Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king.  In this

sepulchre-hell, what did they do?  What man can do in a sepulchre,

they went through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell,

they sang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. 

In the waters of Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could

be heard before the sound of the oars.  Poor Survincent, the poacher,

who had gone through the prison-cellar of the Chatelet, said: 

"It was the rhymes that kept me up."  Uselessness of poetry. 

What is the good of rhyme?



It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had

their birth.  It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Chatelet of Paris

that comes the melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: 

"Timaloumisaine, timaloumison."  The majority of these



       Icicaille est la theatre        Here is the theatre

       Du petit dardant.               Of the little archer (Cupid).





Do what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic

in the heart of man, love.



In this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. 

The secret is the thing above all others.  The secret, in the eyes

of these wretches, is unity which serves as a base of union. 

To betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce

community something of his own personality.  To inform against,

in the energetic slang dialect, is called:  "to eat the bit." 

As though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance

of all and nourished himself on a bit of each one's flesh.



What does it signify to receive a box on the ear? 

Commonplace metaphor replies:  "It is to see thirty-six candles."



Here slang intervenes and takes it up:  Candle, camoufle. 

Thereupon, the ordinary tongue gives camouflet[42] as the synonym

for soufflet.  Thus, by a sort of infiltration from below upwards,

with the aid of metaphor, that incalculable, trajectory slang

mounts from the cavern to the Academy; and Poulailler saying: 

"I light my camoufle," causes Voltaire to write:  "Langleviel La

Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets."





[42] Smoke puffed in the face of a person asleep.





Researches in slang mean discoveries at every step.  Study and

investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point

of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed.



The thief also has his food for cannon, stealable matter, you, I,

whoever passes by; le pantre.  (Pan, everybody.)



Slang is language turned convict.



That the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low, that it

can be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality,

that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss,

is sufficient to create consternation.



Oh, poor thought of miserable wretches!



Alas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness? 

Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the liberator,

the immense rider of Pegasi and hippo-griffs, the combatant of heroes

of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings,

the radiant knight of the future?  Will she forever summon in vain

to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal?  Is she condemned

to hear the fearful approach of Evil through the density of the gulf,

and to catch glimpses, nearer and nearer at hand, beneath the

hideous water of that dragon's head, that maw streaked with foam,

and that writhing undulation of claws, swellings, and rings? 

Must it remain there, without a gleam of light, without hope,

given over to that terrible approach, vaguely scented out

by the monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms,

forever chained to the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white

and naked amid the shadows!







CHAPTER III



SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS





As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred

years ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,

symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful,

now menacing.  One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those

vagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs

of their own, some of which have come down to us.  The eight of clubs,

for instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous

trefoil leaves, a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. 

At the foot of this tree a fire was burning, over which three hares

were roasting a huntsman on a spit, and behind him, on another fire,

hung a steaming pot, whence emerged the head of a dog.  Nothing can be

more melancholy than these reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards,

in the presence of stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the

cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters.  The diverse forms

assumed by thought in the realm of slang, even song, even raillery,

even menace, all partook of this powerless and dejected character. 

All the songs, the melodies of some of which have been collected,

were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking tears. 

The pegre is always the poor pegre, and he is always the hare

in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird.  He hardly complains,

he contents himself with sighing; one of his moans has come

down to us:  "I do not understand how God, the father of men,

can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry,

without himself suffering torture."[43] The wretch, whenever he has

time to think, makes himself small before the low, and frail in the

presence of society; he lies down flat on his face, he entreats,

he appeals to the side of compassion; we feel that he is conscious

of his guilt.





[43] Je n'entrave que le dail comment meck, le daron des orgues,

peut atiger ses momes et ses momignards et les locher criblant sans

etre agite lui-meme.





Towards the middle of the last century a change took place,

prison songs and thieves' ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent

and jovial mien.  The plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla. 

We find in the eighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of

the galleys and prisons, a diabolical and enigmatical gayety. 

We hear this strident and lilting refrain which we should say had

been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam, and which seems to have

been flung into the forest by a will-o'-the-wisp playing the fife:--



                    Miralabi suslababo

                    Mirliton ribonribette

                    Surlababi mirlababo

                    Mirliton ribonribo.





This was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting

a man's throat.



A serious symptom.  In the eighteenth century, the ancient

melancholy of the dejected classes vanishes.  They began to laugh. 

They rally the grand meg and the grand dab.  Given Louis XV. 

they call the King of France "le Marquis de Pantin."  And behold,

they are almost gay.  A sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable

wretches, as though their consciences were not heavy within them

any more.  These lamentable tribes of darkness have no longer

merely the desperate audacity of actions, they possess the heedless

audacity of mind.  A sign that they are losing the sense of their

criminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers,

some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of. 

A sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines

and sophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness,

while communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines.  A sign,

in short, of some outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some

diversion shall arise.



Let us pause a moment.  Whom are we accusing here?  Is it the

eighteenth century?  Is it philosophy?  Certainly not.  The work

of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome. 

The encyclopedists, Diderot at their head; the physiocrates,

Turgot at their head; the philosophers, Voltaire at their head;

the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,--these are four sacred legions. 

Humanity's immense advance towards the light is due to them. 

They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towards

the four cardinal points of progress.  Diderot towards the beautiful,

Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseau

towards the just.  But by the side of and above the philosophers,

there were the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a

healthy growth, hemlock in the virgin forest.  While the executioner

was burning the great books of the liberators of the century

on the grand staircase of the court-house, writers now forgotten

were publishing, with the King's sanction, no one knows what strangely

disorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the unfortunate. 

Some of these publications, odd to say, which were patronized

by a prince, are to be found in the Secret Library.  These facts,

significant but unknown, were imperceptible on the surface. 

Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger. 

It is obscure because it is underhand.  Of all these writers,

the one who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy

gallery was Restif de La Bretonne.



This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages

in Germany than anywhere else.  In Germany, during a given period,

summed up by Schiller in his famous drama The Robbers, theft and pillage

rose up in protest against property and labor, assimilated certain

specious and false elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance,

were absurd in reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas,

disappeared within them, after a fashion, assumed an abstract name,

passed into the state of theory, and in that shape circulated

among the laborious, suffering, and honest masses, unknown even to

the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture, unknown even

to the masses who accepted it.  Whenever a fact of this sort

presents itself, the case is grave.  Suffering engenders wrath;

and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep,

which is the same thing as shutting one's eyes, the hatred of the

unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made

spirit which dreams in a corner, and sets itself to the scrutiny

of society.  The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing.



Hence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearful

commotions which were formerly called jacqueries, beside which purely

political agitations are the merest child's play, which are no

longer the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor, but the

revolt of discomfort against comfort.  Then everything crumbles.



Jacqueries are earthquakes of the people.



It is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the

eighteenth century, which the French Revolution, that immense

act of probity, cut short.



The French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed

with the sword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement,

closed the door of ill and opened the door of good.



It put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma,

rendered the century healthy, crowned the populace.



It may be said of it that it created man a second time, by giving

him a second soul, the right.



The nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work,

and to-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is

simply impossible.  Blind is he who announces it!  Foolish is he

who fears it!  Revolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie.



Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. 

Feudal and monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. 

There is no more of the Middle Ages in our constitution.  We no

longer live in the days when terrible swarms within made irruptions,

when one heard beneath his feet the obscure course of a dull rumble,

when indescribable elevations from mole-like tunnels appeared

on the surface of civilization, where the soil cracked open,

where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where one suddenly beheld

monstrous heads emerging from the earth.



The revolutionary sense is a moral sense.  The sentiment of right,

once developed, develops the sentiment of duty.  The law of all

is liberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins,

according to Robespierre's admirable definition.  Since '89, the

whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual; there is

not a poor man, who, possessing his right, has not his ray of sun;

the die-of-hunger feels within him the honesty of France; the dignity

of the citizen is an internal armor; he who is free is scrupulous;

he who votes reigns.  Hence incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage

of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes heroically lowered before temptations. 

The revolutionary wholesomeness is such, that on a day of deliverance,

a 14th of July, a 10th of August, there is no longer any populace. 

The first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs is: 

death to thieves!  Progress is an honest man; the ideal and the

absolute do not filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons

containing the wealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848?  By the

rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over

the treasure.  Virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. 

In those wagons in chests, hardly closed, and some, even, half-open,

amid a hundred dazzling caskets, was that ancient crown of France,

studded with diamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty,

by the Regent diamond, which was worth thirty millions.  Barefooted,

they guarded that crown.



Hence, no more Jacquerie.  I regret it for the sake of the skilful. 

The old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter;

and henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics.  The principal

spring of the red spectre is broken.  Every one knows it now. 

The scare-crow scares no longer.  The birds take liberties with

the mannikin, foul creatures alight upon it, the bourgeois laugh

at it.







CHAPTER IV



THE TWO DUTIES:  TO WATCH AND TO HOPE





This being the case, is all social danger dispelled?  Certainly not. 

There is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point;

blood will no longer rush to its head.  But let society take heed to

the manner in which it breathes.  Apoplexy is no longer to be feared,

but phthisis is there.  Social phthisis is called misery.



One can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck

by lightning.



Let us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forget

that this is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts

must understand that the first of political necessities consists

in thinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs,

in solacing, airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging

their horizon to a magnificent extent, in lavishing upon them

education in every form, in offering them the example of labor,

never the example of idleness, in diminishing the individual burden

by enlarging the notion of the universal aim, in setting a limit

to poverty without setting a limit to wealth, in creating vast

fields of public and popular activity, in having, like Briareus,

a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed

and the feeble, in employing the collective power for that grand

duty of opening workshops for all arms, schools for all aptitudes,

and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in augmenting salaries,

diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and what is, that is

to say, in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need;

in a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more

comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant.



And, let us say it, all this is but the beginning.  The true

question is this:  labor cannot be a law without being a right.



We will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place

for that.



If nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight.



Intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than

material improvement.  To know is a sacrament, to think is

the prime necessity, truth is nourishment as well as grain. 

A reason which fasts from science and wisdom grows thin.  Let us

enter equal complaint against stomachs and minds which do not eat. 

If there is anything more heart-breaking than a body perishing

for lack of bread, it is a soul which is dying from hunger for the light.



The whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. 

Some day we shall be amazed.  As the human race mounts upward,

the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress. 

The obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation

of level.



We should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation.



The past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment.  It censures. 

This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising.  Behold, it is walking

and advancing.  It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. 

He arrives with his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism,

with his banner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. 

He advances, he threatens, he laughs, he is at our doors.  Let us

not despair, on our side.  Let us sell the field on which Hannibal

is encamped.



What have we to fear, we who believe?



No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there

exists a return of a river on its course.



But let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter. 

When they say "no" to progress, it is not the future but themselves

that they are condemning.  They are giving themselves a sad malady;

they are inoculating themselves with the past.  There is but one way

of rejecting To-morrow, and that is to die.



Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the

soul never,--this is what we desire.



Yes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak,

the problem will be solved.



Yes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be

finished by the nineteenth.  He who doubts this is an idiot! 

The future blossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal

well-being, is a divinely fatal phenomenon.



Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct

them within a given time to a logical state, that is to say,

to a state of equilibrium; that is to say, to equity.  A force

composed of earth and heaven results from humanity and governs it;

this force is a worker of miracles; marvellous issues are no more

difficult to it than extraordinary vicissitudes.  Aided by science,

which comes from one man, and by the event, which comes from another,

it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude

of problems, which seem impossibilities to the vulgar herd. 

It is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the

reconciliation of ideas, than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts,

and we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress,

which brought the Orient and the Occident face to face one fine day,

in the depths of a sepulchre, and made the imaums converse with

Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid.



In the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause

in the grandiose onward march of minds.  Social philosophy consists

essentially in science and peace.  Its object is, and its result

must be, to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms.  It examines,

it scrutinizes, it analyzes; then it puts together once more,

it proceeds by means of reduction, discarding all hatred.



More than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind

which is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks

of nations and empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,--and some

fine day that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them

all away.  The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria,

of Egypt, have disappeared one after the other.  Why?  We know not. 

What are the causes of these disasters?  We do not know. 

Could these societies have been saved?  Was it their fault? 

Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them? 

What is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a

nation and a race?  Questions to which there exists no reply. 

Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations.  They sprung a leak,

then they sank.  We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort

of terror that we look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called

the past, behind those colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those

immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the

fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows. 

But shadows are there, and light is here.  We are not acquainted

with the maladies of these ancient civilizations, we do not know

the infirmities of our own.  Everywhere upon it we have the right

of light, we contemplate its beauties, we lay bare its defects. 

Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness once diagnosed,

the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy. 

Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and

its prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving.  It will be saved. 

It is already much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet

another point.  All the labors of modern social philosophies must

converge towards this point.  The thinker of to-day has a great duty--

to auscultate civilization.



We repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by this

persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages,

an austere interlude in a mournful drama.  Beneath the social mortality,

we feel human imperishableness.  The globe does not perish,

because it has these wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits,

here and there, nor because of a volcano which ejects its pus. 

The maladies of the people do not kill man.



And yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes

his head at times.  The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical

have their hours of weakness.



Will the future arrive?  It seems as though we might almost

put this question, when we behold so much terrible darkness. 

Melancholy face-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched.  On the

part of the selfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education,

appetite increasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity

which dulls, a fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far

as an aversion for the suffering, an implacable satisfaction,

the I so swollen that it bars the soul; on the side of the

wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing others enjoy,

the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires,

hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure and simple ignorance.



Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous

point which we distinguish there one of those which vanish? 

The ideal is frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small,

isolated, imperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great,

black menaces, monstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger

than a star in the maw of the clouds.
