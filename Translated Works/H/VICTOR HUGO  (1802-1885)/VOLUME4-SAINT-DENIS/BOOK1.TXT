	BOOK FIRST.--A FEW PAGES OF HISTORY



CHAPTER I



WELL CUT


1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with

the Revolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking

moments of history.  These two years rise like two mountains midway

between those which precede and those which follow them.  They have

a revolutionary grandeur.  Precipices are to be distinguished there. 

The social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group

of superposed and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the

ancient French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant,

athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. 

These appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement

and resistance.  At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul,

can be descried shining there.



This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning

to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping

the principal lines even at the present day.



We shall make the attempt.



The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to define,

in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and which

are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place.



These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire

to convert them to profit.  In the beginning, the nation asks nothing

but repose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition,

to be small.  Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. 

Of great events, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God,

we have seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads.  We would

exchange Caesar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. 

"What a good little king was he!"  We have marched since daybreak,

we have reached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have

made our first change with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre,

the third with Bonaparte; we are worn out.  Each one demands a bed.



Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which

are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit,

what?  A shelter.  They have it.  They take possession of peace,

of tranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content.  But, at the

same time certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at

the door in their turn.  These facts are the products of revolutions

and wars, they are, they exist, they have the right to install

themselves in society, and they do install themselves therein;

and most of the time, facts are the stewards of the household

and fouriers[32] who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles.





[32] In olden times, fouriers were the officials who preceded

the Court and allotted the lodgings.





This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:--



At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts

demand guarantees.  Guarantees are the same to facts that repose

is to men.



This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector;

this is what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.



These guarantees are a necessity of the times.  They must be accorded. 

Princes "grant" them, but in reality, it is the force of things

which gives them.  A profound truth, and one useful to know,

which the Stuarts did not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons

did not even obtain a glimpse of in 1814.



The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell,

had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed,

and that what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House

of Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing,

and that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. 

was merely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House

of Bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it

should please the King to reassume it.  Still, the House of Bourbon

should have felt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it

did not come from it.



This house was churlish to the nineteenth century.  It put on an

ill-tempered look at every development of the nation.  To make use

of a trivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word,

it looked glum.  The people saw this.



It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried

away before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive

that it had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion.  It did

not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.



It thought that it had roots, because it was the past.  It was mistaken;

it formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. 

The roots of French society were not fixed in the Bourbons,

but in the nations.  These obscure and lively roots constituted,

not the right of a family, but the history of a people. 

They were everywhere, except under the throne.



The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot

in her history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny,

and the necessary base of her politics.  She could get along without

the Bourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years;

there had been a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. 

And how should they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. 

reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII.  was reigning

at the battle of Marengo?  Never, since the origin of history,

had princes been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion

of divine authority which facts contain and promulgate.  Never had

that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied

to such a point the right from on high.



A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more

on the guarantees "granted" in 1814, on the concessions, as it

termed them.  Sad.  A sad thing!  What it termed its concessions

were our conquests; what it termed our encroachments were our rights.



When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration,

supposing itself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in

the country, that is to say, believing itself to be strong and deep,

abruptly decided on its plan of action, and risked its stroke. 

One morning it drew itself up before the face of France, and, elevating

its voice, it contested the collective title and the individual

right of the nation to sovereignty, of the citizen to liberty. 

In other words, it denied to the nation that which made it a nation,

and to the citizen that which made him a citizen.



This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called

the ordinances of July.  The Restoration fell.



It fell justly.  But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile

to all forms of progress.  Great things had been accomplished,

with it alongside.



Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion,

which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur in peace,

which had been wanting under the Empire.  France free and strong

had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of Europe. 

The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon

had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. 

and Charles X. that it was the turn of intelligence to have

the word.  The wind ceased, the torch was lighted once more. 

On the lofty heights, the pure light of mind could be seen flickering. 

A magnificent, useful, and charming spectacle.  For a space of

fifteen years, those great principles which are so old for the thinker,

so new for the statesman, could be seen at work in perfect peace,

on the public square; equality before the law, liberty of conscience,

liberty of speech, liberty of the press, the accessibility of

all aptitudes to all functions.  Thus it proceeded until 1830. 

The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the

hands of Providence.



The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side,

but on the side of the nation.  They quitted the throne with gravity,

but without authority; their descent into the night was not one of

those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history;

it was neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream

of Napoleon.  They departed, that is all.  They laid down the crown,

and retained no aureole.  They were worthy, but they were not august. 

They lacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. 

Charles X. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table

to be cut over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious

about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. 

This diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons, and serious

men who honored their race.  The populace was admirable.  The nation,

attacked one morning with weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection,

felt itself in the possession of so much force that it did not go

into a rage.  It defended itself, restrained itself, restored things

to their places, the government to law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and

then halted!  It took the old king Charles X. from beneath that dais

which had sheltered Louis XIV.  and set him gently on the ground. 

It touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution. 

It was not one man, it was not a few men, it was France,

France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with her victory,

who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice,

before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume

du Vair after the day of the Barricades:--



"It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors

of the great, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough,

from an afflicted fortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves

harsh towards their Prince in his adversity; but as for me,

the fortune of my Kings and especially of my afflicted Kings,

will always be venerable to me."



The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. 

As we have just stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. 

They faded out in the horizon.



The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout

the entire world.  The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm,

the others turned away, each according to his nature.  At the first blush,

the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes,

wounded and stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. 

A fright which can be comprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. 

This strange revolution had hardly produced a shock; it had not even

paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy,

and of shedding its blood.  In the eyes of despotic governments,

who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself,

the Revolution of July committed the fault of being formidable

and of remaining gentle.  Nothing, however, was attempted or

plotted against it.  The most discontented, the most irritated,

the most trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor

may be, a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are

sensible of the collaboration of some one who is working above man.



The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. 

A thing which is full of splendor.



Right overthrowing the fact.  Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution

of 1830, hence, also, its mildness.  Right triumphant has no need

of being violent.



Right is the just and the true.



The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. 

The fact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most

thoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact,

and if it contain only too little of right, or none at all,

is infallibly destined to become, in the course of time, deformed,

impure, perhaps, even monstrous.  If one desires to learn at one blow,

to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the

distance of centuries, let him look at Machiavelli.  Machiavelli is

not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer;

he is nothing but the fact.  And he is not only the Italian fact;

he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth century. 

He seems hideous, and so he is, in the presence of the moral idea

of the nineteenth.



This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin

of society.  To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea

with the humane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically

into the fact and the fact into right, that is the task of sages.







CHAPTER II



BADLY SEWED





But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another. 

The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.



As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste

to prepare the shipwreck.



The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title

of Statesmen; so that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming

somewhat of a slang word.  It must be borne in mind, in fact,

that wherever there is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. 

To say "the skilful" amounts to saying "the mediocre."



In the same way, to say "statesmen" is sometimes equivalent

to saying "traitors."  If, then, we are to believe the skilful,

revolutions like the Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt

ligature is indispensable.  The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. 

Also, right once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. 

Liberty once assured, attention must be directed to power.



Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful,

but they begin to be distrustful.  Power, very good.  But, in the

first place, what is power?  In the second, whence comes it? 

The skilful do not seem to hear the murmured objection, and they

continue their manoeuvres.



According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the

mask of necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement

of a people after a revolution, when this people forms part

of a monarchical continent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. 

In this way, say they, peace, that is to say, time to dress

our wounds, and to repair the house, can be had after a revolution. 

The dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance. 

Now, it is not always easy to procure a dynasty.



If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the first

man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of

a king.  You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.



But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make

a dynasty.  There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity

in a race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.



If we place ourselves at the point of view of the "statesmen," after

making all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the

qualities of the king which result from it?  He may be and it is useful

for him to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his

own person in that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it,

that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein,

that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.



What are the qualities of a dynasty?  It should be national; that is

to say, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed,

but by reason of ideas accepted.  It should be composed of past

and be historic; be composed of future and be sympathetic.



All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves

with finding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second

absolutely insisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick

or the House of Orleans.



Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which,

bending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself. 

Each branch may become a dynasty.  On the sole condition that it shall

bend down to the people.



Such is the theory of the skilful.



Here, then, lies the great art:  to make a little render to success

the sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may

tremble from it also, to season with fear every step that is taken,

to augment the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress,

to dull that aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm,

to cut all angles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right,

to envelop the giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed

very speedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put

Hercules on the treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event

with the expedient, to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal

that nectar thinned out with a potion, to take one's precautions

against too much success, to garnish the revolution with a shade.



1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.



1830 is a revolution arrested midway.  Half of progress, quasi-right. Now,

logic knows not the "almost," absolutely as the sun knows not the candle.



Who arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?



Why?



Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction. 

Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will

be satiety.



The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after

Charles X.



The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of

the bourgeoisie.  The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion

of the people.  The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. 

A chair is not a caste.



But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march

of the human race.  This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.



One is not a class because one has committed a fault.  Selfishness is

not one of the divisions of the social order.



Moreover, we must be just to selfishness.  The state to which

that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired

after the shock of 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated

with indifference and laziness, and which contains a little shame;

it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness

accessible to dreams; it was the halt.



The halt is a word formed of a singular double

and almost contradictory sense:  a troop

on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is to say, repose.



The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on

the alert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels

and holds itself on its guard.



The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of to-morrow.



It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.



What we here call combat may also be designated as progress.



The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man

who should express this word Halt.  An Although-Because.

A composite individuality, signifying revolution and

signifying stability, in other terms, strengthening

the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future.



This man was "already found."  His name was Louis Philippe d'Orleans.



The 221 made Louis Philippe King.  Lafayette undertook the coronation.



He called it the best of republics.  The town-hall of Paris took

the place of the Cathedral of Rheims.



This substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was "the work

of 1830."



When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their

solution became apparent.  All this had been accomplished

outside the bounds of absolute right.  Absolute right cried: 

"I protest!" then, terrible to say, it retired into the darkness.







CHAPTER III



LOUIS PHILIPPE





Revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly

and choose well.  Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced

to the state of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830,

they nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent

them from falling amiss.  Their eclipse is never an abdication.



Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may

be deceived, and grave errors have been seen.



Let us return to 1830.  1830, in its deviation, had good luck. 

In the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution

had been cut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. 

Louis Philippe was a rare man.



The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating

circumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been

of blame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues;

careful of his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs,

knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year;

sober, serene, peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince;

sleeping with his wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged

with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois,

an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become

useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch;

knowing all the languages of Europe, and, what is more rare,

all the languages of all interests, and speaking them; an admirable

representative of the "middle class," but outstripping it, and in every

way greater than it; possessing excellent sense, while appreciating

the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all on his

intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race, very particular,

declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughly the first

Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness,

but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in public,

concise in private; reputed, but not proved to be a miser;

at bottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their

own fancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters;

a gentleman, but not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong;

adored by his family and his household; a fascinating talker,

an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest,

always governing at the shortest range, incapable of rancor and

of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity,

clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong

those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones;

unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, but with

marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients,

in countenances, in masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France! 

Incontestably fond of his country, but preferring his family;

assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity,

a disposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns

everything to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely

repudiate baseness, but which has this valuable side, that it

preserves politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures,

and society from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive,

sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving

himself the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against

England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard;

singing the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to despondency,

to lassitude, to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal,

to daring generosity, to Utopia, to chimeras, to wrath, to vanity,

to fear; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity; a general

at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes; attacked eight times by regicides

and always smiling.  brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker;

uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up,

and unfitted for great political adventures; always ready to risk

his life, never his work; disguising his will in influence, in order

that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king;

endowed with observation and not with divination; not very attentive

to minds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order

to judge; prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom,

easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory,

his only point of resemblance with Caesar, Alexander, and Napoleon;

knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant

of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd,

the interior aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls,

in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currents

of consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in accord

with France lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact;

governing too much and not enough; his own first minister;

excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle

to the immensity of ideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty

of civilization, of order and organization, an indescribable spirit

of proceedings and chicanery, the founder and lawyer of a dynasty;

having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney; in short,

a lofty and original figure, a prince who understood how to create

authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in spite

of the jealousy of Europe.  Louis Philippe will be classed among

the eminent men of his century, and would be ranked among the most

illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little,

and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree

as the feeling for what is useful.



Louis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained graceful;

not always approved by the nation, he always was so by the masses;

he pleased.  He had that gift of charming.  He lacked majesty; he wore

no crown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man;

his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new;

a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830;

Louis Philippe was transition reigning; he had preserved the

ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed

at the service of opinions modern; he loved Poland and Hungary,

but he wrote les Polonois, and he pronounced les Hongrais.  He wore

the uniform of the national guard, like Charles X., and the ribbon

of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.



He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera. 

Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers;

this made a part of his bourgeois popularity.  He had no heart. 

He went out with his umbrella under his arm, and this umbrella

long formed a part of his aureole.  He was a bit of a mason, a bit

of a gardener, something of a doctor; he bled a postilion who had

tumbled from his horse; Louis Philippe no more went about without

his lancet, than did Henri IV.  without his poniard.  The Royalists

jeered at this ridiculous king, the first who had ever shed blood

with the object of healing.



For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction

to be made; there is that which accuses royalty, that which

accuses the reign, that which accuses the King; three columns

which all give different totals.  Democratic right confiscated,

progress becomes a matter of secondary interest, the protests of the

street violently repressed, military execution of insurrections,

the rising passed over by arms, the Rue Transnonain, the counsels

of war, the absorption of the real country by the legal country,

on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons,--

these are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused, Algeria too

harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English,

with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith,

to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,--these are

the doings of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than

national was the doing of the King.



As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King's

charge is decreased.



This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.



Whence arises this fault?



We will state it.



Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation

of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid

of everything and does not like to be disturbed; hence excessive

timidity, which is displeasing to the people, who have the

14th of July in their civil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.



Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled

first of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his

family was deserved by the family.  That domestic group was worthy

of admiration.  Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. 

One of Louis Philippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name

of her race among artists, as Charles d'Orleans had placed it

among poets.  She made of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne

d'Arc. Two of Louis Philippe's daughters elicited from Metternich

this eulogium:  "They are young people such as are rarely seen,

and princes such as are never seen."



This, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration,

is the truth about Louis Philippe.



To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction

of the Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting

side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing

power, therein lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830;

never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event;

the one entered into the other, and the incarnation took place. 

Louis Philippe is 1830 made man.  Moreover, he had in his favor that

great recommendation to the throne, exile.  He had been proscribed,

a wanderer, poor.  He had lived by his own labor.  In Switzerland,

this heir to the richest princely domains in France had sold an old

horse in order to obtain bread.  At Reichenau, he gave lessons

in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and sewed. 

These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie

enthusiastic.  He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage

of Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. 

He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette;

he had belonged to the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped

him on the shoulder; Danton had said to him:  "Young man!" 

At the age of four and twenty, in '93, being then M. de Chartres,

he had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of Louis

XVI., so well named that poor tyrant.  The blind clairvoyance

of the Revolution, breaking royalty in the King and the King

with royalty, did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce

crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal,

the public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply,

the alarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that

sombre breath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe,

of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,--he had looked

on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen

the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention;

he had beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by

who was made responsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy,

rise through the shadows; and there had lingered in his soul

the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace,

which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God.



The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious.  Its memory

was like a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. 

One day, in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted

to doubt, he rectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the

alphabetical list of the Constituent Assembly.



Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight.  While he

reigned the press was free, the tribune was free, conscience and

speech were free.  The laws of September are open to sight. 

Although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges,

he left his throne exposed to the light.  History will do justice

to him for this loyalty.



Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene,

is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience.  His case is,

as yet, only in the lower court.



The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent,

has not yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce

a definite judgment on this king; the austere and illustrious

historian Louis Blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict;

Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called

the 221 and 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, and

a half-revolution; and in any case, from the superior point of view

where philosophy must place itself, we cannot judge him here, as the

reader has seen above, except with certain reservations in the name

of the absolute democratic principle; in the eyes of the absolute,

outside these two rights, the right of man in the first place,

the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation; but what we

can say, even at the present day, that after making these reserves is,

that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he is considered,

Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view

of human goodness, will remain, to use the antique language

of ancient history, one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne.



What is there against him?  That throne.  Take away Louis Philippe

the king, there remains the man.  And the man is good.  He is good at

times even to the point of being admirable.  Often, in the midst of his

gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy

of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there,

exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? 

He took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit,

considering it something to hold his own against Europe, but that it

was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. 

He obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals;

he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the

crown attorneys, those chatterers of the law, as he called them. 

Sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table; he examined them all;

it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. 

One day, he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred: 

"I won seven last night."  During the early years of his reign,

the death penalty was as good as abolished, and the erection of a

scaffold was a violence committed against the King.  The Greve having

disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution

was instituted under the name of the Barriere-Saint-Jacques;

"practical men" felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine;

and this was one of the victories of Casimir Perier, who represented

the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe,

who represented its liberal sides.  Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria

with his own hand.  After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: 

"What a pity that I was not wounded!  Then I might have pardoned!" 

On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry,

he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is one of the most

generous figures of our day:  "His pardon is granted; it only remains

for me to obtain it."  Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. 

and as kindly as Henri IV.



Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls,

the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.



Louis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps,

by others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at

the present day, who knew that king, should come and testify in his

favor before history; this deposition, whatever else it may be,

is evidently and above all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph

penned by a dead man is sincere; one shade may console another shade;

the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it;

it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two

tombs in exile:  "This one flattered the other."







CHAPTER IV



CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION





At the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point

of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which

envelop the beginning of Louis Philippe's reign, it was necessary

that there should be no equivoque, and it became requisite that

this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king.



Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority

without violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue

of a revolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real

aim of the Revolution, but in which he, the Duc d'Orleans,

exercised no personal initiative.  He had been born a Prince,

and he believed himself to have been elected King.  He had not served

this mandate on himself; he had not taken it; it had been offered

to him, and he had accepted it; convinced, wrongly, to be sure,

but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was in accordance with

right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty. 

Hence his possession was in good faith.  Now, we say it in

good conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect

good faith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack,

the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither

on the King nor on the democracy.  A clash of principles resembles

a clash of elements.  The ocean defends the water, the hurricane

defends the air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends

the people; the relative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute,

which is the republic; society bleeds in this conflict, but that

which constitutes its suffering to-day will constitute its safety

later on; and, in any case, those who combat are not to be blamed;

one of the two parties is evidently mistaken; the right is not,

like the Colossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one

foot on the republic, and one in Royalty; it is indivisible,

and all on one side; but those who are in error are so sincerely;

a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. 

Let us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone these

formidable collisions.  Whatever the nature of these tempests may be,

human irresponsibility is mingled with them.



Let us complete this exposition.



The government of 1840 led a hard life immediately.  Born yesterday,

it was obliged to fight to-day.



Hardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague

movements of traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid,

and so lacking in solidity.



Resistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on

the preceding evening.  From month to month the hostility increased,

and from being concealed it became patent.



The Revolution of July, which gained but little acceptance outside

of France by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France,

as we have said.



God delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure text

written in a mysterious tongue.  Men immediately make translations

of it; translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps,

and of nonsense.  Very few minds comprehend the divine language. 

The most sagacious, the calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly,

and when they arrive with their text, the task has long been completed;

there are already twenty translations on the public place. 

From each remaining springs a party, and from each misinterpretation

a faction; and each party thinks that it alone has the true text,

and each faction thinks that it possesses the light.



Power itself is often a faction.



There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current;

they are the old parties.



For the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God,

think that revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt,

one has the right to revolt against them.  Error.  For in these

revolutions, the one who revolts is not the people; it is the king. 

Revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt.  Every revolution,

being a normal outcome, contains within itself its legitimacy,

which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor, but which remains even

when soiled, which survives even when stained with blood.



Revolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. 

A revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real.  It is

because it must be that it is.



None the less did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution

of 1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. 

Errors make excellent projectiles.  They strike it cleverly in its

vulnerable spot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic;

they attacked this revolution in its royalty.  They shouted to it: 

"Revolution, why this king?"  Factions are blind men who aim correctly.



This cry was uttered equally by the republicans.  But coming from them,

this cry was logical.  What was blindness in the legitimists was

clearness of vision in the democrats.  1830 had bankrupted the people. 

The enraged democracy reproached it with this.



Between the attack of the past and the attack of the future,

the establishment of July struggled.  It represented the minute

at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries,

on the other hand with eternal right.



In addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and had

become a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. 

To keep the peace, was an increase of complication.  A harmony

established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. 

From this secret conflict, always muzzled, but always growling,

was born armed peace, that ruinous expedient of civilization which

in the harness of the European cabinets is suspicious in itself. 

The Royalty of July reared up, in spite of the fact that it caught

it in the harness of European cabinets.  Metternich would gladly

have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed on in France by progress,

it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers in Europe.  After having

been towed, it undertook to tow.



Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary,

education, penal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman,

wealth, misery, production, consumption, division, exchange,

coin, credit, the rights of capital, the rights of labor,--

all these questions were multiplied above society, a terrible slope.



Outside of political parties properly so called, another movement

became manifest.  Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic

fermentation.  The elect felt troubled as well as the masses;

in another manner, but quite as much.



Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people,

traversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them with

indescribably vague epileptic shocks.  These dreamers, some isolated,

others united in families and almost in communion, turned over


social questions in a pacific but profound manner; impassive miners,

who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano,

hardly disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they

caught glimpses.



This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this

agitated epoch.



These men left to political parties the question of rights,

they occupied themselves with the question of happiness.



The well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract

from society.



They raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry,

of commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion.  In civilization,

such as it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great

deal by the agency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a

manner to form a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law,

patiently studied by economists, those geologists of politics. 

These men who grouped themselves under different appellations,

but who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists,

endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the

living waters of human felicity.



From the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works

embraced everything.  To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the French

Revolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.



The reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do

not here treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point

of view, the questions raised by socialism.  We confine ourselves

to indicating them.



All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves,

cosmogonic visions, revery and mysticism being cast aside, can be

reduced to two principal problems.



First problem:  To produce wealth.



Second problem:  To share it.



The first problem contains the question of work.



The second contains the question of salary.



In the first problem the employment of forces is in question.



In the second, the distribution of enjoyment.



From the proper employment of forces results public power.



From a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness.



By a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution

must be understood.



From these two things combined, the public power without,

individual happiness within, results social prosperity.



Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.



England solves the first of these two problems.  She creates

wealth admirably, she divides it badly.  This solution which is

complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes: 

monstrous opulence, monstrous wretchedness.  All enjoyments for some,

all privations for the rest, that is to say, for the people;

privilege, exception, monopoly, feudalism, born from toil itself. 

A false and dangerous situation, which sates public power or

private misery, which sets the roots of the State in the sufferings

of the individual.  A badly constituted grandeur in which are combined

all the material elements and into which no moral element enters.



Communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem. 

They are mistaken.  Their division kills production.  Equal partition

abolishes emulation; and consequently labor.  It is a partition

made by the butcher, which kills that which it divides.  It is

therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions. 

Slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it.



The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. 

The two problems must be combined and made but one.



Solve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice,

you will be England.  You will have, like Venice, an artificial

power, or, like England, a material power; you will be the wicked

rich man.  You will die by an act of violence, as Venice died,

or by bankruptcy, as England will fall.  And the world will allow

to die and fall all that is merely selfishness, all that does

not represent for the human race either a virtue or an idea.



It is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England,

we designate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchies

superposed on nations, and not the nations themselves.  The nations

always have our respect and our sympathy.  Venice, as a people,

will live again; England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England,

the nation, is immortal.  That said, we continue.



Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor,

suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the

feeble by the strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy

of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached

the goal, adjust, mathematically and fraternally, salary to labor,

mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of childhood,

and make of science the base of manliness, develop minds while keeping

arms busy, be at one and the same time a powerful people and a family

of happy men, render property democratic, not by abolishing it,

but by making it universal, so that every citizen, without exception,

may be a proprietor, an easier matter than is generally supposed;

in two words, learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it,

and you will have at once moral and material greatness; and you will

be worthy to call yourself France.



This is what socialism said outside and above a few sects

which have gone astray; that is what it sought in facts,

that is what it sketched out in minds.



Efforts worthy of admiration!  Sacred attempts!



These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen

necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account,

confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system

of politics to be created, which shall be in accord with the old

world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal,

a situation in which it became necessary to use Lafayette to

defend Polignac, the intuition of progress transparent beneath

the revolt, the chambers and streets, the competitions to be

brought into equilibrium around him, his faith in the Revolution,

perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague

acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to remain

of his race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people,

his own honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully,

and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was,

he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king.



He felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not,

nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.



Piles of shadows covered the horizon.  A strange shade,

gradually drawing nearer, extended little by little over men,

over things, over ideas; a shade which came from wraths and systems. 

Everything which had been hastily stifled was moving and fermenting. 

At times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing,

so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were

intermingled with truths.  Spirits trembled in the social anxiety

like leaves at the approach of a storm.  The electric tension

was such that at certain instants, the first comer, a stranger,

brought light.  Then the twilight obscurity closed in again. 

At intervals, deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed

as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud.



Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July,

the year 1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending

and threatening.



The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince

de Conde engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus

as Paris did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French

Prince and giving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred

of Nicolas, behind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain,

Miguel in Portugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending

his hand over Bologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona,

at the North no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up

Poland in her coffin, irritated glances watching France narrowly all

over Europe, England, a suspected ally, ready to give a push to that

which was tottering and to hurl herself on that which should fall,

the peerage sheltering itself behind Beccaria to refuse four heads

to the law, the fleurs-de-lys erased from the King's carriage,

the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined,

Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir Perier dead in the

exhaustion of his power; political and social malady breaking

out simultaneously in the two capitals of the kingdom, the one

in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil; at Paris

civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the same glare

of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people;

the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse

de Berry in la Vendee, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera,

added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.







CHAPTER V



FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES





Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. 

The fermentation entered the boiling state.  Ever since 1830,

petty partial revolts had been going on here and there,

which were quickly suppressed, but ever bursting forth afresh,

the sign of a vast underlying conflagration.  Something terrible

was in preparation.  Glimpses could be caught of the features still

indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a possible revolution. 

France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg

Saint-Antoine.



The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning

its ebullition.



The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union

of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops,

grave and stormy.



The government was there purely and simply called in question. 

There people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of

keeping quiet.  There were back shops where workingmen were made to

swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm,

and "that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy." 

This engagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the

wine-shop "assumed a sonorous tone," and said, "You understand! 

You have sworn!"



Sometimes they went up stairs, to a private room on the first floor,

and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted.  They made

the initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as

to the fathers of families.  That was the formula.



In the tap-rooms, "subversive" pamphlets were read.  They treated

the government with contempt, says a secret report of that time.



Words like the following could be heard there:--



"I don't know the names of the leaders.  We folks shall not

know the day until two hours beforehand."  One workman said: 

"There are three hundred of us, let each contribute ten sous,

that will make one hundred and fifty francs with which to procure

powder and shot."



Another said:  "I don't ask for six months, I don't ask for even two. 

In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. 

With twenty-five thousand men we can face them."  Another said: 

"I don't sleep at night, because I make cartridges all night." 

From time to time, men "of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats"

came and "caused embarrassment," and with the air of "command,"

shook hands with the most important, and then went away.  They never

stayed more than ten minutes.  Significant remarks were exchanged

in a low tone:  "The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged."  "It was

murmured by all who were there," to borrow the very expression of one

of those who were present.  The exaltation was such that one day,

a workingman exclaimed, efore the whole wine-shop: "We have no arms!" 

One of his comrades replied:  "The soldiers have!" thus parodying

without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamation to the army

in Italy:  "When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,"

adds one report, "they did not communicate it to each other." 

It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they

said.



These reunions were sometimes periodical.  At certain ones of them,

there were never more than eight or ten persons present, and they

were always the same.  In others, any one entered who wished,

and the room was so full that they were forced to stand. 

Some went thither through enthusiasm and passion; others because

it was on their way to their work.  As during the Revolution,

there were patriotic women in some of these wine-shops who embraced

new-comers.



Other expressive facts came to light.



A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark: 

"Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you."



Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue

de Charonne.  The balloting was carried on in their caps.



Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons

in the Rue de Cotte.  There there was a trophy of arms formed of

wooden broadswords, canes, clubs, and foils.  One day, the buttons

were removed from the foils.



A workman said:  "There are twenty-five of us, but they don't

count on me, because I am looked upon as a machine."  Later on,

that machine became Quenisset.



The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange

and indescribable notoriety.  A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said

to another woman:  "For a long time, there has been a strong force

busy making cartridges."  In the open street, proclamation could

be seen addressed to the National Guard in the departments. 

One of these proclamations was signed:  Burtot, wine-merchant.



One day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an Italian

accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the

Marche Lenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which seemed

to emanate from an occult power.  Groups formed around him,

and applauded.



The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and

noted down.  "--Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn,

our bill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison."--"The

breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted

to us many mediums."--"The future of nations is being worked out in

our obscure ranks."--" Here are the fixed terms:  action or reaction,

revolution or counter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer

believe either in inertia or in immobility.  For the people

against the people, that is the question.  There is no other."--"On

the day when we cease to suit you, break us, but up to that day,

help us to march on."  All this in broad daylight.



Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of the

people by reason of their very audacity.  On the 4th of April, 1832,

a passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle

of the Rue Sainte-Marguerite and shouted:  "I am a Babouvist!" 

But beneath Babeuf, the people scented Gisquet.



Among other things, this man said:--



"Down with property!  The opposition of the left is cowardly

and treacherous.  When it wants to be on the right side,

it preaches revolution, it is democratic in order to escape

being beaten, and royalist so that it may not have to fight. 

The republicans are beasts with feathers.  Distrust the republicans,

citizens of the laboring classes."



"Silence, citizen spy!" cried an artisan.



This shout put an end to the discourse.



Mysterious incidents occurred.



At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a "very

well dressed man," who said to him:  "Whither are you bound,

citizen?"  "Sir," replied the workingman, "I have not the honor

of your acquaintance."  "I know you very well, however."  And the

man added:  "Don't be alarmed, I am an agent of the committee. 

You are suspected of not being quite faithful.  You know that if you

reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on you."  Then he shook hands

with the workingman and went away, saying:  "We shall meet again soon."



The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues,

not only in the wine-shops, but in the street.



"Get yourself received very soon," said a weaver to a cabinet-maker.



"Why?"



"There is going to be a shot to fire."



Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies,

fraught with evident Jacquerie:--



"Who governs us?"



"M. Philippe."



"No, it is the bourgeoisie."



The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word Jacquerie

in a bad sense.  The Jacques were the poor.



On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they

passed by:  "We have a good plan of attack."



Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four

men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere

du Trone:--



"Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris

any more."



Who was the he?  Menacing obscurity.



"The principal leaders," as they said in the faubourg, held themselves

apart.  It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop

near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Society

aid for tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving

as intermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.



Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about

these leaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular

arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before

the Court of Peers:--



"Who was your leader?"



"I knew of none and I recognized none."



There was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes

idle reports, rumors, hearsay.  Other indications cropped up.



A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around

the ground on which a house was in process of construction,

in the Rue de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment

of a letter on which were still legible the following lines:--





The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the

sections for the different societies.





And, as a postscript:--





We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere,

No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house

of a gunsmith in that court.  The section owns no arms.





What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his

neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up

another paper, torn like the first, and still more significant,

of which we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest

attaching to these strange documents:--



+------------------------------------------------------------+ | Q

| C | D | E | Learn this list by heart.  After so doing | | | | |

| you will tear it up.  The men admitted | | | | | | will do the

same when you have transmitted | | | | | | their orders to them. 

| | | | | | Health and Fraternity, | | | | | | u og a fe L. |

+------------------------------------------------------------+





It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret

of this find at the time, learned the significance of those four

capital letters:  quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs

[scouts], and the sense of the letters:  u og a fe, which was a date,

and meant April 15th, 1832.  Under each capital letter were inscribed

names followed by very characteristic notes.  Thus:  Q. Bannerel. 

8 guns, 83 cartridges.  A safe man.--C. Boubiere.  1 pistol,

40 cartridges.--D. Rollet.  1 foil, 1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.--

E. Tessier.  1 sword, 1 cartridge-box. Exact.--Terreur.  8 guns. 

Brave, etc.



Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure,

a third paper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly,

this sort of enigmatical list:--



          Unite:  Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6.

          Barra.  Soize.  Salle-au-Comte.

          Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?

          J. J. R.

          Caius Gracchus.

          Right of revision.  Dufond.  Four.

          Fall of the Girondists.  Derbac.  Maubuee.

          Washington.  Pinson.  1 pistol, 86 cartridges.

          Marseillaise.

          Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.

          Hoche.

          Marceau.  Plato.  Arbre-Sec.

          Warsaw.  Tilly, crier of the Populaire.





The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew

its significance.  It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature

of the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rights

of Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. 

To-day, when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than

history, we may publish them.  It should be added, that the foundation

of the Society of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to

the date when this paper was found.  Perhaps this was only a rough draft.



Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according to

written notes, material facts begin to make their appearance.



In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-abrac, there

were seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise

and in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this

same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card,

on which was written the following:--



           Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . .  12 ounces.

           Sulphur   . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.

           Charcoal  . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces and a half.

           Water     . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.





The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong

smell of powder.



A mason returning from his day's work, left behind him a little

package on a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz.  This package

was taken to the police station.  It was opened, and in it were

found two printed dialogues, signed Lahautiere, a song entitled: 

"Workmen, band together," and a tin box full of cartridges.



One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see

how warm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.



In a ditch on the boulevard, between Pere-Lachaise and the Barriere

du Trone, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing,

discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood,

a bag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation

of cartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of

hunting-powder, and a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented

evident traces of melted lead.



Police agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five

o'clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon,

who was afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section and got

himself killed in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing

near his bed, and holding in his hand some cartridges which he

was in the act of preparing.



Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet

between the Barriere Picpus and the Barriere Charenton in a little

lane between two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there

was a "Jeu de Siam."[33] One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse

and handed it to the other.  As he was handing it to him, he noticed

that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp. 

He primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already

in the pan.  Then the two men parted.





[33] A game of ninepins, in which one side of the ball is smaller

than the other, so that it does not roll straight, but describes

a curve on the ground.





A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the

affair of April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred

cartridges and twenty-four flints.



The government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred

thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. 

On the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. 

The remarkable point about it was, that the police were not able to

seize a single one.



An intercepted letter read:  "The day is not far distant when,

within four hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be

under arms."



All this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. 

The approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the

face of the government.  No singularity was lacking to this still

subterranean crisis, which was already perceptible.  The bourgeois

talked peaceably to the working-classes of what was in preparation. 

They said:  "How is the rising coming along?" in the same tone in

which they would have said:  "How is your wife?"



A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired:  "Well, when are

you going to make the attack?"



Another shop-keeper said:--



"The attack will be made soon."



"I know it.  A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you,

now there are twenty-five thousand."  He offered his gun,

and a neighbor offered a small pistol which he was willing to sell

for seven francs.



Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing.  Not a point in Paris

nor in France was exempt from it.  The artery was beating everywhere. 

Like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form

in the human body, the network of secret societies began to spread

all over the country.  From the associations of the Friends

of the People, which was at the same time public and secret,

sprang the Society of the Rights of Man, which also dated from one

of the orders of the day:  Pluviose, Year 40 of the republican era,

which was destined to survive even the mandate of the Court of

Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and which did not hesitate

to bestow on its sections significant names like the following:--



     Pikes.

     Tocsin.

     Signal cannon.

     Phrygian cap.

     January 21.

     The beggars.

     The vagabonds.

     Forward march.

     Robespierre.

     Level.

     Ca Ira.



The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. 

These were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead. 

Other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great

mother societies.  The members of sections complained that they

were torn asunder.  Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee

of organization of the Municipalities.  Thus the associations for the

liberty of the press, for individual liberty, for the instruction

of the people against indirect taxes.  Then the Society of Equal

Workingmen which was divided into three fractions, the levellers,

the communists, the reformers.  Then the Army of the Bastilles,

a sort of cohort organized on a military footing, four men commanded

by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty by

a lieutenant; there were never more than five men who knew each other. 

Creation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed

stamped with the genius of Venice.



The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms,

the Society of Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.



A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about

among these the republican affiliations.  It was denounced

and repudiated there.



The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities,

Lyons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society

of the Rights of Man, the Charbonniere, and The Free Men. 

All had a revolutionary society which was called the Cougourde. 

We have already mentioned this word.



In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with

the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than

the faubourgs.  A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop

of the Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served

as rallying points for the students.  The Society of the Friends

of the A B C affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the

Cougourde of Aix, met, as we have seen, in the Cafe Musain. 

These same young men assembled also, as we have stated already, in a

restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mondetour which was called Corinthe. 

These meetings were secret.  Others were as public as possible,

and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments

of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions: 

"Where was this meeting held?"  "In the Rue de la Paix." 

"At whose house?"  "In the street."  "What sections were there?" 

"Only one."  "Which?"  "The Manuel section."  "Who was its leader?" 

"I." "You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course

of attacking the government.  Where did your instructions come from?" 

"From the central committee."



The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved

subsequently by the operations of Beford, Luneville, and Epinard. 

They counted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth,

on the thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. 

In Burgundy and in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree;

that is to say, a pole surmounted by a red cap.



Such was the situation.



The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population,

as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and made

it felt.  That was the sore point.  This old faubourg, peopled like

an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a hive of bees,

was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. 

Everything was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption,

however, of the regular work.  It is impossible to convey an idea

of this lively yet sombre physiognomy.  In this faubourg exists

poignant distress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist rare

and ardent minds.  It is particularly in the matter of distress

and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet.



The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble;

for it received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures,

strikes, slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. 

In times of revolution misery is both cause and effect.  The blow

which it deals rebounds upon it.  This population full of proud virtue,

capable to the highest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly

to arms, prompt to explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to

be only awaiting the fall of a spark.  Whenever certain sparks

float on the horizon chased by the wind of events, it is impossible

not to think of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and of the formidable

chance which has placed at the very gates of Paris that powder-house

of suffering and ideas.



The wine-shops of the Faubourg Antoine, which have been more than

once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused,

possess historical notoriety.  In troublous times people grow

intoxicated there more on words than on wine.  A sort of prophetic

spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there, swelling hearts

and enlarging souls.  The cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine

resemble those taverns of Mont Aventine erected on the cave of

the Sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath;

taverns where the tables were almost tripods, and where was drunk

what Ennius calls the sibylline wine.



The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. 

Revolutionary agitations create fissures there, through which

trickles the popular sovereignty.  This sovereignty may do evil;

it can be mistaken like any other; but, even when led astray,

it remains great.  We may say of it as of the blind cyclops, Ingens.



In '93, according as the idea which was floating about was good

or evil, according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm,

there leaped forth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions,

now heroic bands.



Savage.  Let us explain this word.  When these bristling men,

who in the early days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling,

wild, with uplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves

upon ancient Paris in an uproar, what did they want?  They wanted

an end to oppression, an end to tyranny, an end to the sword,

work for men, instruction for the child, social sweetness for

the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread for all, the idea

for all, the Edenizing of the world.  Progress; and that holy,

sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible wise,

driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist, a roar

in their mouths.  They were savages, yes; but the savages of civilization.



They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only

with fear and trembling, to force the human race to paradise. 

They seemed barbarians, and they were saviours.  They demanded

light with the mask of night.



Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying,

but ferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men,

smiling, embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings,

in white plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their

elbows on a velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently

on demeanor and the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages,

of divine right, of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the

death penalty, of war, glorifying in low tones and with politeness,

the sword, the stake, and the scaffold.  For our part, if we were

forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization

and the civilized men of barbarism, we should choose the barbarians.



But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible.  No perpendicular

fall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear.



Neither despotism nor terrorism.  We desire progress with a gentle slope.



God takes care of that.  God's whole policy consists in rendering

slopes less steep.







CHAPTER VI



ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS





It was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible catastrophe,

instituted a kind of mysterious census.



All were present at a secret meeting at the Cafe Musain.



Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical

but significant metaphors:--



"It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we

may count.  If combatants are required, they must be provided. 

It can do no harm to have something with which to strike. 

Passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are

bulls on the road than when there are none.  Let us, therefore,

reckon a little on the herd.  How many of us are there? 

There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow.

Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose. 

Let us mistrust the unexpected.  Let us not be caught unprepared. 

We must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they

hold fast.  This business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac,

you will see the polytechnic students.  It is their day to go out. 

To-day is Wednesday.  Feuilly, you will see those of the Glaciere,

will you not?  Combeferre has promised me to go to Picpus. 

There is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there.  Bahorel will

visit the Estrapade.  Prouvaire, the masons are growing lukewarm;

you will bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honore.

Joly will go to Dupuytren's clinical lecture, and feel the pulse

of the medical school.  Bossuet will take a little turn in the court

and talk with the young law licentiates.  I will take charge of the

Cougourde myself."



"That arranges everything," said Courfeyrac.



"No."



"What else is there?"



"A very important thing."



"What is that?" asked Courfeyrac.



"The Barriere du Maine," replied Enjolras.



Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection,

then he resumed:--



"At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers, painters,

and journeymen in the studios of sculptors.  They are an enthusiastic

family, but liable to cool off.  I don't know what has been the matter

with them for some time past.  They are thinking of something else. 

They are becoming extinguished.  They pass their time playing dominoes. 

There is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little,

but with firmness.  They meet at Richefeu's. They are to be found

there between twelve and one o'clock. Those ashes must be fanned into

a glow.  For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius,

who is a good fellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. 

I need some one for the Barriere du Maine.  I have no one."



"What about me?" said Grantaire.  "Here am I."



"You?"



"I."



"You indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown

cold in the name of principle!"



"Why not?"



"Are you good for anything?"



"I have a vague ambition in that direction," said Grantaire.



"You do not believe in everything."



"I believe in you."



"Grantaire will you do me a service?"



"Anything.  I'll black your boots."



"Well, don't meddle with our affairs.  Sleep yourself sober from

your absinthe."



"You are an ingrate, Enjolras."



"You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine!  You capable of it!"



"I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres, of crossing the Place

Saint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking

the Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the

Rue d'Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind

me the Conseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries,

of striding across the boulevard, of following the Chaussee du Maine,

of passing the barrier, and entering Richefeu's. I am capable of that. 

My shoes are capable of that."



"Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu's?"



"Not much.  We only address each other as thou."



"What will you say to them?"



"I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi!  Of Danton. 

Of principles."



"You?"



"I. But I don't receive justice.  When I set about it, I am terrible. 

I have read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my

constitution of the year Two by heart.  `The liberty of one citizen

ends where the liberty of another citizen begins.'  Do you take me

for a brute?  I have an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. 

The Rights of Man, the sovereignty of the people, sapristi!  I am

even a bit of a Hebertist.  I can talk the most superb twaddle

for six hours by the clock, watch in hand."



"Be serious," said Enjolras.



"I am wild," replied Grantaire.



Enjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man

who has taken a resolution.



"Grantaire," he said gravely, "I consent to try you.  You shall go

to the Barriere du Maine."



Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Cafe Musain. 

He went out, and five minutes later he returned.  He had gone home

to put on a Robespierre waistcoat.



"Red," said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. 

Then, with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet

points of the waistcoat across his breast.



And stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:--



"Be easy."



He jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.



A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Cafe Musain

was deserted.  All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his

own direction, each to his own task.  Enjolras, who had reserved

the Cougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.



Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met

on the plain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are

so numerous in that side of Paris.



As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation

in review in his own mind.  The gravity of events was self-evident.

When facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady,

move heavily, the slightest complication stops and entangles them. 

A phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births.  Enjolras descried

a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. 

Who knows?  Perhaps the moment was at hand.  The people were

again taking possession of right, and what a fine spectacle! 

The revolution was again majestically taking possession of France and

saying to the world:  "The sequel to-morrow!" Enjolras was content. 

The furnace was being heated.  He had at that moment a powder train

of friends scattered all over Paris.  He composed, in his own mind,

with Combeferre's philosophical and penetrating eloquence,

Feuilly's cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac's dash, Bahorel's smile,

Jean Prouvaire's melancholy, Joly's science, Bossuet's sarcasms,

a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once. 

All hands to work.  Surely, the result would answer to the effort. 

This was well.  This made him think of Grantaire.



"Hold," said he to himself, "the Barriere du Maine will not take me

far out of my way.  What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu's?

Let us have a look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he

is getting on."



One o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras

reached the Richefeu smoking-room.



He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door

fall to and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled

with tables, men, and smoke.



A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another voice. 

It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.



Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne

table, strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos.  He was

hammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:--



"Double-six."



"Fours."



"The pig!  I have no more."



"You are dead.  A two."



"Six."



"Three."



"One."



"It's my move."



"Four points."



"Not much."



"It's your turn."



"I have made an enormous mistake."



"You are doing well."



"Fifteen."



"Seven more."



"That makes me twenty-two." [Thoughtfully, "Twenty-two!"]



"You weren't expecting that double-six. If I had placed it

at the beginning, the whole play would have been changed."



"A two again."



"One."



"One!  Well, five."



"I haven't any."



"It was your play, I believe?"



"Yes."



"Blank."



"What luck he has!  Ah!  You are lucky!  [Long revery.] Two."



"One."



"Neither five nor one.  That's bad for you."



"Domino."



"Plague take it!"
