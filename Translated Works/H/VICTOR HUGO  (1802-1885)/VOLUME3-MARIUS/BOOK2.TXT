CHAPTER I



NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH



In the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge

there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved

the memory of a worthy man named M. Gillenormand, and who mention

him with complaisance.  This good man was old when they were young. 

This silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared--for those who regard

with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past--

from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which,

under Louis XIV., the names of all the provinces of France were

appended exactly as in our day, the streets of the new Tivoli quarter

have received the names of all the capitals of Europe; a progression,

by the way, in which progress is visible.



M.Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831,

was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed,

simply because they have lived a long time, and who are strange

because they formerly resembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. 

He was a peculiar old man, and in very truth, a man of another age,

the real, complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth

century, who wore his good, old bourgeoisie with the air with which

marquises wear their marquisates.  He was over ninety years of age,

his walk was erect, he talked loudly, saw clearly, drank neat,

ate, slept, and snored.  He had all thirty-two of his teeth. 

He only wore spectacles when he read.  He was of an amorous disposition,

but declared that, for the last ten years, he had wholly and

decidedly renounced women.  He could no longer please, he said;

he did not add:  "I am too old," but:  "I am too poor."  He said: 

"If I were not ruined--Heee!"  All he had left, in fact, was an

income of about fifteen thousand francs.  His dream was to come

into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income

for mistresses.  He did not belong, as the reader will perceive,

to that puny variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire,

have been dying all their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot;

this jovial old man had always had good health.  He was superficial,

rapid, easily angered.  He flew into a passion at everything,

generally quite contrary to all reason.  When contradicted, he raised

his cane; he beat people as he had done in the great century. 

He had a daughter over fifty years of age, and unmarried, whom he

chastised severely with his tongue, when in a rage, and whom he

would have liked to whip.  She seemed to him to be eight years old. 

He boxed his servants' ears soundly, and said:  "Ah! carogne!" 

One of his oaths was:  "By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!" 

He had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himself shaved

every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him,

being jealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty

and coquettish barberess.  M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment

in all things, and declared that he was extremely sagacious;

here is one of his sayings:  "I have, in truth, some penetration;

I am able to say when a flea bites me, from what woman it came."



The words which he uttered the most frequently were:  the sensible man,

and nature.  He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation

which our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter,

after his own fashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: 

"Nature," he said, "in order that civilization may have a little

of everything, gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism. 

Europe possesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale. 

The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. 

The dancers at the opera are pink female savages.  They do not eat men,

they crunch them; or, magicians that they are, they transform them

into oysters and swallow them.  The Caribbeans leave only the bones,

they leave only the shell.  Such are our morals.  We do not devour,

we gnaw; we do not exterminate, we claw."







CHAPTER II



LIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSE





He lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. 

He owned the house.  This house has since been demolished and rebuilt,

and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions

of numeration which the streets of Paris undergo.  He occupied

an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor, between street

and gardens, furnished to the very ceilings with great Gobelins

and Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes; the subjects

of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the

arm-chairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast, nine-leaved screen

of Coromandel lacquer.  Long, full curtains hung from the windows,

and formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent. 

The garden situated immediately under his windows was attached

to that one of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase

twelve or fifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and

descended with great agility.  In addition to a library adjoining

his chamber, he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal,

a gallant and elegant retreat, with magnificent hangings of straw,

with a pattern of flowers and fleurs-de-lys made on the galleys

of Louis XIV.  and ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne for

his mistress.  M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal

great-aunt, who had died a centenarian.  He had had two wives. 

His manners were something between those of the courtier,

which he had never been, and the lawyer, which he might have been. 

He was gay, and caressing when he had a mind.  In his youth he

had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives

and never by their mistresses, because they are, at the same time,

the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers

in existence.  He was a connoisseur of painting.  He had in his chamber

a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens,

executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details,

in a confused and hap-hazard manner.  M. Gillenormand's attire

was not the habit of Louis XIV.  nor yet that of Louis XVI.;

it was that of the Incroyables of the Directory.  He had thought

himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions. 

His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous revers, a long

swallow-tail and large steel buttons.  With this he wore knee-breeches

and buckle shoes.  He always thrust his hands into his fobs. 

He said authoritatively:  "The French Revolution is a heap

of blackguards."







CHAPTER III



LUC-ESPRIT





At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the

honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the

same time--ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire,

the Camargo and the Salle.  Caught between two fires, he had beaten

a heroic retreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry,

who was sixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was

in love.  He abounded in memories.  He was accustomed to exclaim: 

"How pretty she was--that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the

last time I saw her at Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained

sentiments, with her come-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the

color of persons newly arrived, and her little agitation muff!" 

He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin,

which he was fond of talking about effusively.  "I was dressed

like a Turk of the Levant Levantin," said he.  Madame de Boufflers,

having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had described him as "a

charming fool."  He was horrified by all the names which he saw

in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois. 

He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he said,

stifling outbursts of laughter the while.  "Oh!" he said,

"what people these are!  Corbiere!  Humann!  Casimir Perier! 

There's a minister for you!  I can imagine this in a journal: 

`M. Gillenorman, minister!' that would be a farce.  Well!  They are so

stupid that it would pass"; he merrily called everything by its name,

whether decent or indecent, and did not restrain himself in the least

before ladies.  He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, and filth

with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant. 

It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century. 

It is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age

of crudities in prose.  His god-father had predicted that he

would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowed on him these two

significant names:  Luc-Esprit.







CHAPTER IV



A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT





He had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he

was born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais,

whom he called the Duc de Nevers.  Neither the Convention, nor the

death of Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons,

nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. 

The Duc de Nevers was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. 

"What a charming grand seigneur," he said, "and what a fine air he

had with his blue ribbon!"



In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparation

for the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for three

thousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. 

He grew animated on this subject:  "The elixir of gold," he exclaimed,

"the yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte's drops, in the

eighteenth century,--this was the great remedy for the catastrophes

of love, the panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. 

Louis XV.  sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope."  He would have

been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told

him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. 

M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789;

he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during

the Terror, and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of

gayety and cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off. 

If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic

in his presence, he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on

the point of swooning.  He sometimes alluded to his ninety years,

and said, "I hope that I shall not see ninety-three twice." 

On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live to be

a hundred.







CHAPTER V



BASQUE AND NICOLETTE





He had theories.  Here is one of them:  "When a man is passionately

fond of women, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares

but little, who is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights,

perched on the code, and jealous at need, there is but one way

of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace,

and that is to let his wife control the purse-strings. This

abdication sets him free.  Then his wife busies herself,

grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her fingers

covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education

of half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers,

presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law,

follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself

the sovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises,

binds fast and annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges,

disarranges, hoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme

and personal delight, and that consoles her.  While her husband

disdains her, she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband." 

This theory M. Gillenormand had himself applied, and it had become

his history.  His wife--the second one--had administered his fortune

in such a manner that, one fine day, when M. Gillenormand found

himself a widower, there remained to him just sufficient to live on,

by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen

thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire with him. 

He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave

a property behind him.  Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are

subject to adventures, and, for instance, become national property;

he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents,

and he had no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. 

"All that's the Rue Quincampois!" he said.  His house in the Rue

Filles-du-Clavaire belonged to him, as we have already stated. 

He had two servants, "a male and a female."  When a servant entered

his establishment, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him.  He bestowed on

the men the name of their province:  Nimois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. 

His last valet was a big, foundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five,

who was incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born

at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque.  All the female

servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the Magnon,

of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook,

a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. 

"How much wages do you want a month?" asked M. Gillenormand. 

"Thirty francs."  "What is your name?"  "Olympie."  "You shall

have fifty francs, and you shall be called Nicolette."







CHAPTER VI



IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN





With M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious

at being in despair.  He had all sorts of prejudices and took

all sorts of liberties.  One of the facts of which his exterior

relief and his internal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have

just hinted, that he had remained a brisk spark, and that he passed

energetically for such.  This he called having "royal renown." 

This royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls. 

One day, there was brought to him in a basket, as though it had

been a basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who was yelling

like the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which a

servant-maid, dismissed six months previously, attributed to him. 

M. Gillenormand had, at that time, fully completed his

eighty-fourth year.  Indignation and uproar in the establishment. 

And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that? 

What audacity!  What an abominable calumny!  M. Gillenormand himself

was not at all enraged.  He gazed at the brat with the amiable smile

of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and said in an aside: 

"Well, what now?  What's the matter?  You are finely taken aback,

and really, you are excessively ignorant.  M. le Duc d'Angouleme,

the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade of fifteen

when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother

to the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age

of eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Presidente Jacquin,

a son, a real child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta

and a counsellor of state; one of the great men of this century,

the Abbe Tabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. There is

nothing out of the ordinary in these things.  And then, the Bible! 

Upon that I declare that this little gentleman is none of mine. 

Let him be taken care of.  It is not his fault."  This manner

of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose name was Magnon,

sent him another parcel in the following year.  It was a boy again. 

Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated.  He sent the two brats

back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month

for their maintenance, on the condition that the said mother would

not do so any more.  He added:  "I insist upon it that the mother

shall treat them well.  I shall go to see them from time to time." 

And this he did.  He had had a brother who was a priest, and who had

been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years,

and had died at seventy-nine. "I lost him young," said he. 

This brother, of whom but little memory remains, was a peaceable

miser, who, being a priest, thought himself bound to bestow alms

on the poor whom he met, but he never gave them anything except

bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of going

to hell by way of paradise.  As for M. Gillenormand the elder,

he never haggled over his alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. 

He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich,

his turn of mind would have been magnificent.  He desired

that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner,

even his rogueries.  One day, having been cheated by a business

man in a matter of inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner,

he uttered this solemn exclamation:  "That was indecently done! 

I am really ashamed of this pilfering.  Everything has degenerated

in this century, even the rascals.  Morbleu! this is not the way

to rob a man of my standing.  I am robbed as though in a forest,

but badly robbed.  Silva, sint consule dignae!"  He had had two wives,

as we have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter,

who had remained unmarried, and by the second another daughter,

who had died at about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love,

or chance, or otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served

in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire, who had won

the cross at Austerlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo. 

"He is the disgrace of my family," said the old bourgeois. 

He took an immense amount of snuff, and had a particularly graceful

manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand. 

He believed very little in God.







CHAPTER VII



RULE:  RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING





Such was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his hair,--

which was gray rather than white,--and which was always dressed in

"dog's ears."  To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this.



He had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous and great.



In 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand,

who was still young,--he was only seventy-four,--lived in the

Faubourg Saint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice.

He had only retired to the Marais when he quitted society,

long after attaining the age of eighty.



And, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. 

The principal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his

door absolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one

whatever except in the evening.  He dined at five o'clock, and after

that his door was open.  That had been the fashion of his century,

and he would not swerve from it.  "The day is vulgar," said he,

"and deserves only a closed shutter.  Fashionable people only light up

their minds when the zenith lights up its stars."  And he barricaded

himself against every one, even had it been the king himself. 

This was the antiquated elegance of his day.







CHAPTER VIII



TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR





We have just spoken of M. Gillenormand's two daughters.  They had

come into the world ten years apart.  In their youth they had

borne very little resemblance to each other, either in character

or countenance, and had also been as little like sisters to each

other as possible.  The youngest had a charming soul, which turned

towards all that belongs to the light, was occupied with flowers,

with verses, with music, which fluttered away into glorious space,

enthusiastic, ethereal, and was wedded from her very youth, in ideal,

to a vague and heroic figure.  The elder had also her chimera;

she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor, a contractor,

a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man, or even a prefect;

the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the antechamber

with a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues of the

town-hall, to be "Madame la Prefete,"--all this had created

a whirlwind in her imagination.  Thus the two sisters strayed,

each in her own dream, at the epoch when they were young girls. 

Both had wings, the one like an angel, the other like a goose.



No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. 

No paradise becomes terrestrial in our day.  The younger wedded

the man of her dreams, but she died.  The elder did not marry at all.



At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we

are relating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude,

with one of the sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds

that it is possible to see.  A characteristic detail; outside of

her immediate family, no one had ever known her first name. 

She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand, the elder.



In the matter of cant, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given

points to a miss.  Her modesty was carried to the other extreme

of blackness.  She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day,

a man had beheld her garter.



Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty.  Her guimpe

was never sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. 

She multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed

of looking.  The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more

sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced.



Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries

of innocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew,

named Theodule, to embrace her without displeasure.



In spite of this favored Lancer, the label:  Prude, under which we have

classed her, suited her to absolute perfection.  Mademoiselle Gillenormand

was a sort of twilight soul.  Prudery is a demi-virtue and a demi-vice.



To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining.  She belonged

to the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals,

mumbled special orisons, revered "the holy blood," venerated "the

sacred heart," remained for hours in contemplation before a

rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank

and file of the faithful, and there allowed her soul to soar among

little clouds of marble, and through great rays of gilded wood.



She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself,

named Mademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead,

and beside whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being

an eagle.  Beyond the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois

had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of

making preserves.  Mademoiselle Vaubois, perfect in her style,

was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence.



Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather

than lost as she grew older.  This is the case with passive natures. 

She had never been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then,

years wear away the angles, and the softening which comes with time

had come to her.  She was melancholy with an obscure sadness

of which she did not herself know the secret.  There breathed

from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished,

and which had never had a beginning.



She kept house for her father.  M. Gillenormand had his daughter

near him, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister

with him.  These households comprised of an old man and an old

spinster are not rare, and always have the touching aspect of two

weaknesses leaning on each other for support.



There was also in this house, between this elderly spinster

and this old man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling

and mute in the presence of M. Gillenormand.  M. Gillenormand

never addressed this child except in a severe voice, and sometimes,

with uplifted cane:  "Here, sir! rascal, scoundrel, come here!--

Answer me, you scamp!  Just let me see you, you good-for-nothing!"

etc., etc.  He idolized him.



This was his grandson.  We shall meet with this child again later on.
