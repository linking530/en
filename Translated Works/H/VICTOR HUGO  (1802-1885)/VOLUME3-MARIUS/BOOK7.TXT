CHAPTER I



MINES AND MINERS


Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance,

a third lower floor.  The social soil is everywhere undermined,

sometimes for good, sometimes for evil.  These works are superposed

one upon the other.  There are superior mines and inferior mines. 

There is a top and a bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes

gives way beneath civilization, and which our indifference and

heedlessness trample under foot.  The Encyclopedia, in the last century,

was a mine that was almost open to the sky.  The shades, those sombre

hatchers of primitive Christianity, only awaited an opportunity to

bring about an explosion under the Caesars and to inundate the human

race with light.  For in the sacred shadows there lies latent light. 

Volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth. 

Every form begins by being night.  The catacombs, in which the first

mass was said, were not alone the cellar of Rome, they were the vaults

of the world.



Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure,

there are excavations of all sorts.  There is the religious mine,

the philosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. 

Such and such a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. 

Such another with wrath.  People hail and answer each other from one

catacomb to another.  Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. 

There they branch out in every direction.  They sometimes meet,

and fraternize there.  Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes,

who lends him his lantern.  Sometimes they enter into combat there. 

Calvin seizes Socinius by the hair.  But nothing arrests nor interrupts

the tension of all these energies toward the goal, and the vast,

simultaneous activity, which goes and comes, mounts, descends,

and mounts again in these obscurities, and which immense unknown

swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside

and the outside.  Society hardly even suspects this digging

which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels.  There are

as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works,

as there are extractions.  What emerges from these deep excavations? 

The future.



The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. 

The work is good, up to a degree which the social philosophies

are able to recognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed;

lower down, it becomes terrible.  At a certain depth, the excavations

are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit

breathable by man has been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.



The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of this

ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold,

and where one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine,

sometimes misshapen.  Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther,

there is Descartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire,

there is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre;

below Robespierre, there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. 

And so it goes on.  Lower down, confusedly, at the limit which separates

the indistinct from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men,

who perhaps do not exist as yet.  The men of yesterday are spectres;

those of to-morrow are forms.  The eye of the spirit distinguishes

them but obscurely.  The embryonic work of the future is one of the

visions of philosophy.



A world in limbo, in the state of foetus, what an unheard-of spectre!



Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.



Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves,

binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always,

think themselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly,

and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others.  The first

are paradisiacal, the last are tragic.  Nevertheless, whatever may be

the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal,

from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this

is it:  disinterestedness.  Marat forgets himself like Jesus. 

They throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think

not of themselves.  They have a glance, and that glance seeks

the absolute.  The first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last,

enigmatical though he may be, has still, beneath his eyelids,

the pale beam of the infinite.  Venerate the man, whoever he may be,

who has this sign--the starry eye.



The shadowy eye is the other sign.



With it, evil commences.  Reflect and tremble in the presence of any

one who has no glance at all.  The social order has its black miners.



There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and where

light becomes extinct.



Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all

these galleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system

of progress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower

than Marat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without

any connection with the upper levels, there lies the last mine. 

A formidable spot.  This is what we have designated as the le

troisieme dessous.  It is the grave of shadows.  It is the cellar

of the blind.  Inferi.



This communicates with the abyss.







CHAPTER II



THE LOWEST DEPTHS





There disinterestedness vanishes.  The demon is vaguely outlined;

each one is for himself.  The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles,

and gnaws.  The social Ugolino is in this gulf.



The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts,

almost phantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are

ignorant both of the idea and of the word; they take no thought

for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires. 

They are almost unconscious, and there exists within them a sort

of terrible obliteration.  They have two mothers, both step-mothers,

ignorance and misery.  They have a guide, necessity; and for all

forms of satisfaction, appetite.  They are brutally voracious,

that is to say, ferocious, not after the fashion of the tyrant,

but after the fashion of the tiger.  From suffering these spectres

pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy creation, logic of darkness. 

That which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer

complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest of matter. 

Man there becomes a dragon.  To be hungry, to be thirsty--that is

the point of departure; to be Satan--that is the point reached. 

From that vault Lacenaire emerges.



We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments

of the upper mine, of the great political, revolutionary, and

philosophical excavation.  There, as we have just said, all is pure,

noble, dignified, honest.  There, assuredly, one might be misled;

but error is worthy of veneration there, so thoroughly does it imply

heroism.  The work there effected, taken as a whole has a name:  Progress.



The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths,

hideous depths.  There exists beneath society, we insist upon

this point, and there will exist, until that day when ignorance

shall be dissipated, the great cavern of evil.



This cavern is below all, and is the foe of all.  It is hatred,

without exception.  This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has

never cut a pen.  Its blackness has no connection with the sublime

blackness of the inkstand.  Never have the fingers of night which

contract beneath this stifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book

nor unfolded a newspaper.  Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche;

Marat is an aristocrat to Schinderhannes.  This cavern has for its

object the destruction of everything.



Of everything.  Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates. 

It not only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social order;

it undermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, it undermines

civilization, it undermines revolution, it undermines progress. 

Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder, assassination. 

It is darkness, and it desires chaos.  Its vault is formed of ignorance.



All the others, those above it, have but one object--to suppress it. 

It is to this point that philosophy and progress tend, with all

their organs simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real,

as well as by their contemplation of the absolute.  Destroy the cavern

Ignorance and you destroy the lair Crime.



Let us condense, in a few words, a part of what we have just written. 

The only social peril is darkness.



Humanity is identity.  All men are made of the same clay. 

There is no difference, here below, at least, in predestination. 

The same shadow in front, the same flesh in the present, the same

ashes afterwards.  But ignorance, mingled with the human paste,

blackens it.  This incurable blackness takes possession of the

interior of a man and is there converted into evil.







CHAPTER III



BABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE





A quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnasse

governed the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.



Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position.  For his lair he had

the sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles

were of marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern,

his torso that of a colossus, his head that of a bird.  One thought

one beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton

velvet waistcoat.  Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion,

might have subdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to

be one.  A low brow, large temples, less than forty years of age,

but with crow's-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard

like that of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. 

His muscles called for work, his stupidity would have none of it. 

He was a great, idle force.  He was an assassin through coolness. 

He was thought to be a creole.  He had, probably, somewhat to do

with Marshal Brune, having been a porter at Avignon in 1815. 

After this stage, he had turned ruffian.



The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer. 

Babet was thin and learned.  He was transparent but impenetrable. 

Daylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. 

He declared that he was a chemist.  He had been a jack of all trades. 

He had played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose,

a fine talker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. 

His occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts

and portraits of "the head of the State."  In addition to this,

he extracted teeth.  He had exhibited phenomena at fairs,

and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster: 

"Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the Academies, makes physical

experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, undertakes

stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners.  Price:  one tooth,

one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth,

two francs, fifty.  Take advantage of this opportunity." 

This Take advantage of this opportunity meant:  Have as many teeth

extracted as possible.  He had been married and had had children. 

He did not know what had become of his wife and children.  He had

lost them as one loses his handkerchief.  Babet read the papers,

a striking exception in the world to which he belonged.  One day,

at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels,

he had read in the Messager, that a woman had just given birth to a child,

who was doing well, and had a calf's muzzle, and he exclaimed: 

"There's a fortune! my wife has not the wit to present me with a child

like that!"



Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to "undertake Paris." 

This was his expression.



Who was Claquesous?  He was night.  He waited until the sky was daubed

with black, before he showed himself.  At nightfall he emerged from

the hole whither he returned before daylight.  Where was this hole? 

No one knew.  He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute

darkness, and with his back turned to them.  Was his name Claquesous? 

Certainly not.  If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. 

He was a ventriloquist.  Babet said:  "Claquesous is a nocturne

for two voices."  Claquesous was vague, terrible, and a roamer. 

No one was sure whether he had a name, Claquesous being a sobriquet;

none was sure that he had a voice, as his stomach spoke more

frequently than his voice; no one was sure that he had a face,

as he was never seen without his mask.  He disappeared as though he

had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as though he

sprang from the earth.



A lugubrious being was Montparnasse.  Montparnasse was a child;

less than twenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries,

charming black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes;

he had all vices and aspired to all crimes.



The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse.  It was

the street boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. 

He was genteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. 

The rim of his hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make

room for a tuft of hair, after the style of 1829.  He lived by robbery

with violence.  His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. 

Montparnasse was a fashion-plate in misery and given to the commission

of murders.  The cause of all this youth's crimes was the desire

to be well-dressed. The first grisette who had said to him: 

"You are handsome!" had cast the stain of darkness into his heart,

and had made a Cain of this Abel.  Finding that he was handsome,

he desired to be elegant:  now, the height of elegance is idleness;

idleness in a poor man means crime.  Few prowlers were so dreaded

as Montparnasse.  At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses

in his past.  More than one passer-by lay with outstretched arms

in the presence of this wretch, with his face in a pool of blood. 

Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman, the bust

of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the boulevard

wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon

in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of

the sepulchre.







CHAPTER IV



COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE





These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent

among the police, and striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet

glances "under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain," lending each

other their names and their traps, hiding in their own shadows,

boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other,

stripping off their personalities, as one removes his false nose

at a masked ball, sometimes simplifying matters to the point of

consisting of but one individual, sometimes multiplying themselves

to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them for a whole throng.



These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious

robber with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris;

they were that monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt

of society.



Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying

their relations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse

were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the

department of the Seine.  The inventors of ideas of that nature,

men with nocturnal imaginations, applied to them to have their

ideas executed.  They furnished the canvas to the four rascals,

and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery.  They labored

at the stage setting.  They were always in a condition to lend

a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded

a lift of the shoulder, and which were sufficiently lucrative. 

When a crime was in quest of arms, they under-let their accomplices. 

They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition

of all underground tragedies.



They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they

woke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere.  There they

held their conferences.  They had twelve black hours before them;

they regulated their employment accordingly.



Patron-Minette,--such was the name which was bestowed in the

subterranean circulation on the association of these four men. 

In the fantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day

by day, Patron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as entre chien

et loup--between dog and wolf--signifies the evening.  This appellation,

Patron-Minette, was probably derived from the hour at which their

work ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the

separation of ruffians.  These four men were known under this title. 

When the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison,

and questioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied,

"Who did it?" demanded the President.  Lacenaire made this response,

enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear

to the police:  "Perhaps it was Patron-Minette."



A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages;

in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list

of ruffians composing it.  Here are the appellations to which

the principal members of Patron-Minette answered,--for the names

have survived in special memoirs.



Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.



Brujon.  [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from

interpolating this word.]



Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.



Laveuve.



Finistere.



Homere-Hogu, a negro.



Mardisoir.  (Tuesday evening.)



Depeche.  (Make haste.)



Fauntleroy, alias Bouquetiere (the Flower Girl).



Glorieux, a discharged convict.



Barrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.



L'Esplanade-du-Sud.



Poussagrive.



Carmagnolet.



Kruideniers, called Bizarro.



Mangedentelle.  (Lace-eater.)



Les-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.)



Demi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.



Etc., etc.



We pass over some, and not the worst of them.  These names have

faces attached.  They do not express merely beings, but species. 

Each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen

fungi from the under side of civilization.



Those beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances,

were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. 

Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed, they went off by day

to sleep, sometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned

quarries of Montmatre or Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. 

They ran to earth.



What became of these men?  They still exist.  They have always existed. 

Horace speaks of them:  Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae,

mendici, mimae; and so long as society remains what it is,

they will remain what they are.  Beneath the obscure roof of

their cavern, they are continually born again from the social ooze. 

They return, spectres, but always identical; only, they no longer

bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins. 

The individuals extirpated, the tribe subsists.



They always have the same faculties.  From the vagrant to the tramp,

the race is maintained in its purity.  They divine purses in pockets,

they scent out watches in fobs.  Gold and silver possess an odor

for them.  There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said,

that they have a "stealable" air.  These men patiently pursue

these bourgeois.  They experience the quivers of a spider at the

passage of a stranger or of a man from the country.



These men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches

a glimpse of them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. 

They do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists;

one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows,

that they are in no wise distinct from them, that they possess

no other soul than the darkness, and that it is only momentarily

and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life,

that they have separated from the night.



What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish?  Light. 

Light in floods.  Not a single bat can resist the dawn. 

Light up society from below.
