to purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a

journeyman to us.  We could not then employ him; but I foolishly

let him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper,

and might then have work for him.  My hopes of success, as I told him,

were founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford,

was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet

was profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely

fail of good encouragement.  I requested Webb not to mention it;

but he told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,

published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb

was to be employ'd. I resented this; and, to counteract them,

as I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces of

entertainment for Bradford's paper, under the title of the BUSY BODY,

which Breintnal continu'd some months.  By this means the attention

of the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals,

which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were disregarded.  He began

his paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters of

a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to me

for a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go on with it,

took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years extremely

profitable to me.



I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number,

though our partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that,

in fact, the whole management of the business lay upon me. 

Meredith was no compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. 

My friends lamented my connection with him, but I was to make the best

of it.



Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before

in the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited

remarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor

Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,

occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of,

and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.



Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went on

growing continually.  This was one of the first good effects of my

having learnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men,

seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle

a pen, thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me. 

Bradford still printed the votes, and laws, and other publick business. 

He had printed an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,

blundering manner, we reprinted it elegantly and correctly,

and sent one to every member.  They were sensible of the difference: 

it strengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they

voted us their printers for the year ensuing.



Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton,

before mentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat

in it.  He interested himself for me strongly in that instance,

as he did in many others afterward, continuing his patronage till

his death.<6>



     <6> I got his son once L500.--[Marg. note.]



Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him,

but did not press me.  I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment,

crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me,

and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest,

and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.



But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least

reason to expect.  Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for

our printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able

to advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid;

and a hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient,

and su'd us all.  We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could

not be rais'd in time, the suit must soon come to a judgment

and execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined,

as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps at

half price.



In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten,

nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came to

me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application

from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should

be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself,

if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing

the partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen

drunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to

our discredit.  These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. 

I told them I could not propose a separation while any prospect

remain'd of the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement,

because I thought myself under great obligations to them for what they

had done, and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd

in their performance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should

then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.



Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,

"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken

in this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and

me what he would for you alone.  If that is the case, tell me,

and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business." 

"No," said he, "my father has really been disappointed, and is

really unable; and I am unwilling to distress him farther. 

I see this is a business I am not fit for.  I was bred a farmer,

and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirty

years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade.  Many of our Welsh

people are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap. 

I am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old employment. 

You may find friends to assist you.  If you will take the debts

of the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound he

has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirty

pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership,

and leave the whole in your hands."  I agreed to this proposal: 

it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately. 

I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina,

from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing the

best account that had been given of that country, the climate,

the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious. 

I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction to

the publick.



As soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because I

would not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of

what each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other;

paid off the company's debts, and went on with the business

in my own name, advertising that the partnership was dissolved. 

I think this was in or about the year 1729.



About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,

only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that soon

to be sunk.  The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being against

all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate,

as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors. 

We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on the side

of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723

had done much good by increasing the trade, employment, and number

of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old houses

inhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered well,

that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia,

eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, between

Second and Front streets, with bills on their doors, "To be let";

and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me then

think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.



Our debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote

and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled "The Nature and

Necessity of a Paper Currency."  It was well receiv'd by the common

people in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd

and strengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to have

no writers among them that were able to answer it, their opposition

slacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. 

My friends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service,

thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money;

a very profitable jobb and a great help to me.  This was another

advantage gain'd by my being able to write.



The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as

never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-five

thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which it

arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds,

trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, till

I now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful.



I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the

Newcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;

small things appearing great to those in small circumstances;

and these, to me, were really great advantages, as they were

great encouragements.  He procured for me, also, the printing

of the laws and votes of that government, which continu'd

in my hands as long as I follow'd the business.



I now open'd a little stationer's shop.  I had in it blanks of

all sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted

in that by my friend Breintnal.  I had also paper, parchment,

chapmen's books, etc.  One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London,

an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly

and diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose.



I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the

printing-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman,

I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal,

but to avoid all appearances to the contrary.  I drest plainly;

I was seen at no places of idle diversion.  I never went out a fishing

or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work,

but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I

was not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper

I purchas'd at the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow. 

Thus being esteem'd an industrious, thriving young man, and paying

duly for what I bought, the merchants who imported stationery

solicited my custom; others proposed supplying me with books,

and I went on swimmingly.  In the mean time, Keimer's credit

and business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to sell his

printing house to satisfy his creditors.  He went to Barbadoes,

and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.



His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd

with him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought

his materials.  I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival

in Harry, as his friends were very able, and had a good deal

of interest.  I therefore propos'd a partner-ship to him which he,

fortunately for me, rejected with scorn.  He was very proud,

dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd expensively, took much diversion

and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business;

upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do,

he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him. 

There this apprentice employ'd his former master as a journeyman;

they quarrel'd often; Harry went continually behindhand, and at

length was forc'd to sell his types and return to his country work

in Pensilvania.  The person that bought them employ'd Keimer to use them,

but in a few years he died.



There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the

old one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing

now and then by straggling hands, but was not very anxious

about the business.  However, as he kept the post-office, it was

imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news; his paper

was thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine,

and therefore had many, more, which was a profitable thing to him,

and a disadvantage to me; for, tho' I did indeed receive and send

papers by the post, yet the publick opinion was otherwise, for what

I did send was by bribing the riders, who took them privately,

Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which occasion'd some

resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of him for it, that,

when I afterward came into his situation, I took care never to imitate it.



I had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in part

of my house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop

for his glazier's business, tho' he worked little, being always

absorbed in his mathematics.  Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me

with a relation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often

together, till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being

in herself very deserving.  The old folks encourag'd me by continual

invitations to supper, and by leaving us together, till at length

it was time to explain.  Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty. 

I let her know that I expected as much money with their daughter

as would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house, which I

believe was not then above a hundred pounds.  She brought me word

they had no such sum to spare; I said they might mortgage their

house in the loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was,

that they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford,

they had been inform'd the printing business was not a profitable one;

the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer

and D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probably

soon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house,

and the daughter shut up.



Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice,

on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract,

and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave

them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not;

but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. 

Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of

their disposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declared

absolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family. 

This was resented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed,

leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.



But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd

round me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places;

but soon found that, the business of a printer being generally

thought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife,

unless with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable. 

In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried

me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way,

which were attended with some expense and great inconvenience,

besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper which of

all things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it. 

A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintances

had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had a

regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house. 

I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs,

wherein I sometimes was of service.  I piti'd poor Miss Read's

unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful,

and avoided company.  I considered my giddiness and inconstancy

when in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness,

tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own

than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither,

and persuaded the other match in my absence.  Our mutual affection

was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. 

The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife being

said to be living in England; but this could not easily be prov'd,

because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of his death,

it was not certain.  Then, tho' it should be true, he had left

many debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay. 

We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her

to wife, September 1st, 1730.  None of the inconveniences happened

that we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate,

assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have

ever mutually endeavored to make each other happy.  Thus I corrected

that great erratum as well as I could.



About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little

room of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition

was made by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in our

disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have them

altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted;

and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should,

while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage

of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly

as beneficial as if each owned the whole.  It was lik'd and agreed to,

and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we could

best spare.  The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'

they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring

for want of due care of them, the collection, after about a year,

was separated, and each took his books home again



And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for

a subscription library.  I drew up the proposals, got them put into

form by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends

in the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each

to begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term

our company was to continue.  We afterwards obtain'd a charter,

the company being increased to one hundred:  this was the mother

of all the North American subscription libraries, now so numerous. 

It is become a great thing itself, and continually increasing. 

These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans,

made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen

from other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree

to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense

of their privileges.



Memo.  Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the beginning

and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importance

to others.  What follows was written many years after in compliance

with the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly intended for

the public.  The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the interruption.



     Letter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life

                    (received in Paris).



"MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been desirous of

writing to thee, but could not be reconciled to the thought that

the letter might fall into the hands of the British, lest some

printer or busy-body should publish some part of the contents,

and give our friend pain, and myself censure.



"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy,

about twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an

account of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son,

ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in

thy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means,

if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latter

part may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee

will not delay it.  Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us;

and what will the world say if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben. 

Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing

and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertaining

not only to a few, but to millions?  The influence writings under

that class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere

appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals. 

It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring

to become as good and eminent as the journalist.  Should thine,

for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail of

it), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy

early youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be! 

I know of no character living, nor many of them put together,

who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit

of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance

with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would have no

other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is

of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it."





The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown

to a friend, I received from him the following:



     Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.       

                                 "PARIS, January 31, 1783.



"My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutes

of the principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your

Quaker acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing

my reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publish

it as he desired.  Various concerns have for some time past prevented

this letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worth

any expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present,

I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as the

terms I am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners,

I shall only tell you how I would address any other person,

who was as good and as great as yourself, but less diffident. 

I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the history of your life

from the following motives:  Your history is so remarkable,

that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it;

and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as your own management

of the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a table

of the internal circumstances of your country, which will very

much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds. 

And considering the eagerness with which such information is sought

by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a

more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give. 

All that has happened to you is also connected with the detail

of the manners and situation of a rising people; and in this

respect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can

be more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society. 

But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared with

the chance which your life will give for the forming of future

great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you

design to publish) of improving the features of private character,

and consequently of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic. 

The two works I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noble

rule and example of self-education. School and other education

constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy

apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple,

and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons

are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming

prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery that

the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable! 

Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not only

an influence late in life, but a weak influence.  It is in youth

that we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth

that we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony. 

In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education even

of the next generation is given; in youth the private and public

character is determined; and the term of life extending but from youth

to age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especially

before we take our party as to our principal objects.  But your

biography will not merely teach self-education, but the education

of a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improve

his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man. 

And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we see

our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guide

in this particular, from the farthest trace of time?  Show then,

sir, how much is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and invite

all wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise. 

When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race,

and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance,

it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific,

acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be great

and domestic, enviable and yet good-humored.



"The little private incidents which you will also have to relate,

will have considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of

prudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you

have acted in these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life,

and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained

to them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight. 

The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have other

people's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting;

this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will

have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike;

and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality

as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy;

and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its

errors considered) than human life?



"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated

fantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes;

but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but

what is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your account

of yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin,

will hold not only in point of character, but of private history)

will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important,

as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue,

or greatness.  As no end likewise happens without a means, so we

shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you

became considerable; but at the same time we may see that though

the event is flattering,the means are as simple as wisdom could

make them;that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought and

habit.Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman's

waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world. 

Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to

forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently

that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life. 

Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the

passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment

instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets. 

Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves

in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom

patience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent,

sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling

Dr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance,

which he considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singular

that he should have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness,

without which you never could have waited for your advancement,

or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which is

a strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance

of regulating our minds.  If this correspondent had known the nature

of your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your former

writings and measures would secure attention to your Biography,

and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return,

would secure attention to them.  This is an advantage attendant upon

a various character, and which brings all that belongs to it into

greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more persons

are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters,

than they are for the time or the inclination to do it.  But there

is one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your life

as a mere piece of biography.  This style of writing seems a little

gone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen

of it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject of

comparison with the lives of various public cutthroats and intriguers,

and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers. 

If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own,

and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will be

worth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being tired of figuring

to myself a character of which every feature suits only one man in

the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter,

my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application to your proper self. 

I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let the

world into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils nay

otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age,

the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking,

it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently

master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind. 

Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period,

will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it,

and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will be

highly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as your

own character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny,

it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country,

as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should stand

respectable and eternal.  For the furtherance of human happiness,

I have always maintained that it is necessary to prove that

man is not even at present a vicious and detestable animal;

and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him;

and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to see

the opinion established, that there are fair characters existing

among the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men,

without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people will

cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of taking

their share in the scramble of life, or at least of making it

comfortable principally for themselves.  Take then, my dear sir,

this work most speedily into hand:  shew yourself good as you are good;

temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourself

as one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord,

in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted,

as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life. 

Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you. 

When they think well of individuals in your native country,

they will go nearer to thinking well of your country; and when your

countrymen see themselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will go

nearer to thinking well of England.  Extend your views even further;

do not stop at those who speak the English tongue, but after having

settled so many points in nature and politics, think of bettering

the whole race of men.  As I have not read any part of the life

in question, but know only the character that lived it, I write

somewhat at hazard.  I am sure, however, that the life and the treatise

I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief

of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measure

of suiting these performances to the several views above stated. 

Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer

of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed pieces

to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure

that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a life

otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain. 

In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressed

to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir,

etc., etc.,

Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris, 1784.



It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been

too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain. 

It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,

which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my

return being uncertain and having just now a little leisure, I will

endeavor to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home,

it may there be corrected and improv'd.



Not having any copy here of what is already written, I know

not whether an account is given of the means I used to establish

the Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning,

is now become so considerable, though I remember to have come

down to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore

begin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if found

to have been already given.



At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good

bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. 

In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold

only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Those

who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from England;

the members of the Junto had each a few.  We had left the alehouse,

where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. 

I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room,

where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences,

but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow

such as he wish'd to read at home.  This was accordingly done,

and for some time contented us.



Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to

render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public

subscription library.  I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would

be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden,

to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed,

by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first

purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. 

So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority

of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find

more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down

for this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. 

On this little fund we began.  The books were imported; the library

wag opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers,

on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. 

The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by

other towns, and in other provinces.  The libraries were augmented

by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people,

having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study,

became better acquainted with books, and in a few years were

observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent

than people of the same rank generally are in other countries.



When we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles, which were

to be binding upon us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden,

the scrivener, said to us, "You are young men, but it is scarcely

probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term

fix'd in the instrument."  A number of us, however, are yet living;

but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter

that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.



The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions,

made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as the

proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one's

reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbors,

when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. 

I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated

it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go

about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. 

In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after

practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes,

can heartily recommend it.  The present little sacrifice of your

vanity will afterwards be amply repaid.  If it remains a while

uncertain to whom the merit belongs, some one more vain than

yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will

be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers,

and restoring them to their right owner.



This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,

for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd

in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once

intended for me.  Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. 

I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind;

and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigable

as it was necessary.  I was indebted for my printing-house;

I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contend

with for business two printers, who were established in the place

before me.  My circumstances, however, grew daily easier. 

My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having,

among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb

of Solomon, "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand

before kings, he shall not stand before mean men," I from thence

considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction,

which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should ever

literally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened;

for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sitting

down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.



We have an English proverb that says, "He that would thrive, must ask

his wife."  It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd

to industry and frugality as myself.  She assisted me cheerfully

in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop,

purchasing old linen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc.  We kept

no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture

of the cheapest.  For instance, my breakfast was a long time bread

and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer,

with a pewter spoon.  But mark how luxury will enter families,

and make a progress, in spite of principle:  being call'd one morning

to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! 

They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife,

and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings,

for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that she

thought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well

as any of his neighbors.  This was the first appearance of plate

and China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years,

as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds

in value.



I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho'

some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees

of God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible,

others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public

assemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was

without some religious principles.  I never doubted, for instance,

the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd

it by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was

the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime

will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. 

These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to

be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected

them all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found them

more or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendency

to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principally

to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.  This respect

to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects,

induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen

the good opinion another might have of his own religion; and as

our province increas'd in people, and new places of worship were

continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contributions,

my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.
