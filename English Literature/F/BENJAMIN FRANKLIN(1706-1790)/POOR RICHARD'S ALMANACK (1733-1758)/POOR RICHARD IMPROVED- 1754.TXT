        _Poor Richard Improved_

        Kind READER,
        I have now serv'd you three Apprenticeships, yet, old as I am,
I have no Inclination to quit your Service, but should be glad to be
able to continue in it three times three Apprenticeships longer.

        The first _Astrologers_ I think, were honest Husbandmen; and so
it seems are the last; for my Brethren _Jerman_ and _Moore_, and
myself, the only remaining Almanack-makers of this Country, are all
of that Class: Tho' in intermediate Times our Art has been cultivated
in great Cities, and even in the Courts of Princes; witness History,
from the Days of King NEBUCHADNEZZAR I. of _Babylon_, to those of
Queen JAMES I. of _England._ -- But you will ask, perhaps, how I
prove that the first Astrologers were Countrymen? -- I own this is a
Matter beyond the Memory of History, for Astrology was before
Letters; but I prove it from the Book of the Heavens, from the Names
of the twelve Signs, which were mostly given to remark some
Circumstance relative to rural Affairs, in the several successive
Months of the Year, and by that Means to supply the Want of
Almanacks. -- Thus, as the Year of the Ancients began most naturally
with the Spring, _Aries_ and _Taurus_, that is, the Ram and the Bull,
represented the successive Addition to their Flocks of Sheep and
Kine, by their Produce in that Season, Lambs and Calves. -- _Gemini_
were originally the Kids, but called the Twins, as Goats more
commonly bring forth two than one: These follow'd the Calves. --
_Cancer_, the Crab, came next, when that Kind of Fish were in Season.
-- Then follow'd _Leo_, the Lion, and _Virgo_, the Wench, to mark the
Summer Months, and Dog-days, when those Creatures were most
mischievous.  In Autumn comes first _Libra_, the Ballance, to point
out the Time for weighing and selling the Summer's Produce; or
rather, a Time of Leisure for holding Courts of Justice in which they
might plague themselves and Neighbours; I know some suppose this Sign
to signify the equal Poise, at that Time, of Day and Night; but the
other Signification is the truer, as plainly appears by the following
Sign _Scorpio_, or the Scorpion, with the Sting in his Tail, which
certainly denotes the Paying of Costs. -- Then follows _Sagittary_,
the Archer, to show the Season of Hunting; for now the Leaves being
off the Trees and Bushes, the Game might be more easily seen and
struck with their Arrows. -- The _Goat_ accompanies the short Days
and long Nights of Winter, to shew the Season of Mirth, Feasting and
Jollity; for what can _Capricorn_ mean, but Dancing or Cutting of
_Capers_? -- At length comes _Aquarius_, or the Water-bearer, to show
the Season of Snows, Rains and Floods; and lastly _Pisces_, or the
two Shads, to denote the approaching Return of those Fish up the
Rivers: Make your Wears, hawl your Seins; Catch 'em and pickle 'em,
my Friends; they are excellent Relishers of old Cyder. -- But if you
can't get Shad, Mackrell may do better.

        I know, gentle Readers, that many of you always expect a
Preface, and think yourselves slighted if that's omitted.  So here
you have it, and much good may't do ye.  As little as it is to the
Purpose, there are many less so, now-a-days. -- I have left out, you
see, all the usual Stuff about the _Importunity of Friends_, and the
like, or I might have made it much bigger.  You think, however, that
'tis big enough o'Conscience, for any Matter of Good that's in it; --
I think so too, if it fills the Page, which is the Needful at
present, from
                                         _Your loving Friend to serve,_
                                                 R. SAUNDERS.
                                 ______

        The first Degree of Folly, is to conceit one's self wise; the
second to profess it; the third to despise Counsel.

        Take heed of the Vinegar of sweet Wine, and the Anger of
Good-nature.

        The Bell calls others to Church, but itself never minds the
Sermon.

        Cut the Wings of your Hens and Hopes, lest they lead you a
weary Dance after them.

        In Rivers & bad Governments, the lightest Things swim at top.

        The Cat in Gloves catches no Mice.

        If you'd know the Value of Money, go and borrow some.

        The Horse thinks one thing, and he that saddles him another.

        Love your Neighbour; yet don't pull down your Hedge.

        When _Prosperity_ was well mounted, she let go the Bridle, and
soon came tumbling out of the Saddle.

        Some make Conscience of wearing a Hat in the Church, who make
none of robbing the Altar.

        In the Affairs of this World Men are saved, not by Faith, but
by the Want of it.

        _Friendship_ cannot live with _Ceremony_, nor without
_Civility._

        Praise little, dispraise less.

        The learned Fool writes his Nonsense in better Language than
the unlearned; but still 'tis Nonsense.

        A Child thinks 20 _Shillings_ and 20 Years can scarce ever be
spent.

        Don't think so much of your own Cunning, as to forget other
Mens: A cunning Man is overmatch'd by a cunning Man and a Half.

        Willows are weak, but they bind the Faggot.

        You may give a Man an Office, but you cannot give him
Discretion.

        He that doth what he should not, shall feel what he would not.

        To be intimate with a foolish Friend, is like going to bed to a
Razor.

        Little Rogues easily become great Ones.

        You may sometimes be much in the wrong, in owning your being in
the right.

        _Friends_ are the true Sceptres of Princes.

        Where Sense is wanting, every thing is wanting.

        Many Princes sin with _David_, but few repent with him.

        He that hath no _ill_ Fortune will be troubled with _good._

        For Age and Want save while you may;
        No Morning Sun lasts a whole Day.

        Learning to the Studious; Riches to the Careful; Power to the
Bold; Heaven to the Virtuous.

        Now glad the Poor with _Christmas_ Cheer;
        Thank God you're able so to end the Year.
