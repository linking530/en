        _Poor Richard Improved_
        1756

        COURTEOUS READER,
        I suppose my Almanack may be worth the Money thou hast paid for
it, hadst thou no other Advantage from it, than to find the _Day of
the Month_, the _remarkable Days_, the _Changes of the Moon_, the
_Sun and Moon's Rising and Setting_, and to foreknow the _Tides_ and
the _Weather_; these, with other Astronomical Curiosities, I have
yearly and constantly prepared for thy Use and Entertainment, during
now near two Revolutions of the Planet _Jupiter._ But I hope this is
not all the Advantage thou hast reaped; for with a View to the
Improvement of thy _Mind_ and thy _Estate_, I have constantly
interspers'd in every little Vacancy, _Moral Hints_, _Wise Sayings_,
and _Maxims of Thrift_, tending to impress the Benefits arising from
_Honesty_, _Sobriety_, _Industry_ and _Frugality_; which if thou hast
duly observed, it is highly probable thou art _wiser_ and _richer_
many fold more than the Pence my Labours have cost thee.  Howbeit, I
shall not therefore raise my Price because thou art better able to
pay; but being thankful for past Favours, shall endeavour to make my
little Book more worthy thy Regard, by adding to those _Recipes_
which were intended for the _Cure_ of the _Mind_, some valuable Ones
regarding the _Health_ of the _Body._ They are recommended by the
Skilful, and by successful Practice.  I wish a Blessing may attend
the Use of them, and to thee all Happiness, being
                                         _Thy obliged Friend,_
                                                 R. SAUNDERS.

        A Change of _Fortune_ hurts a wise Man no more than a Change of
the _Moon._

        Does Mischief, Misconduct, & Warrings displease ye;
        Think there's a Providence, 'twill make ye easy.

        _Mine_ is better than _Ours._

        Love your Enemies, for they tell you your Faults.

        He that has a Trade, has an Office of Profit and Honour.

        Be civil to _all_; serviceable to _many_; familiar with _few_;
Friend to _one_; Enemy to _none._

        _Vain-Glory_ flowereth, but beareth no Fruit.

        As I spent some Weeks last Winter, in visiting my old
Acquaintance in the _Jerseys_, great Complaints I heard for Want of
Money, and that Leave to make more Paper Bills could not be obtained.
_Friends and Countrymen_, my Advice on this Head shall cost you
nothing, and if you will not be angry with me for giving it, I
promise you not to be offended if you do not take it.

        You spend yearly at least _Two Hundred Thousand Pounds_, 'tis
said, in _European_, _East-Indian_, and _West-Indian_ Commodities:
Supposing one Half of this Expence to be in _Things absolutely
necessary_, the other Half may be call'd _Superfluities_, or at best,
Conveniences, which however you might live without for one little
Year, and not suffer exceedingly.  Now to save this Half, observe
these few Directions.


        1. When you incline to have new Cloaths, look first well over
the old Ones, and see if you cannot shift with them another Year,
either by Scouring, Mending, or even Patching if necessary.  Remember
a Patch on your Coat, and Money in your Pocket, is better and more
creditable than a Writ on your Back, and no Money to take it off.

        2. When you incline to buy China Ware, Chinces, _India_ Silks,
or any other of their flimsey slight Manufactures; I would not be so
hard with you, as to insist on your absolutely _resolving against
it_; all I advise, is, to _put it off_ (as you do your Repentance)
_till another Year_; and this, in some Respects, may prevent an
Occasion of Repentance.

        3. If you are now a Drinker of Punch, Wine or Tea, twice a Day;
for the ensuing Year drink them but _once_ a Day.  If you now drink
them but once a Day, do it but every other Day.  If you do it now but
once a Week, reduce the Practice to once a Fortnight.  And if you do
not exceed in Quantity as you lessen the Times, half your Expence in
these Articles will be saved.

        4thly and lastly, When you incline to drink Rum, fill the Glass
_half_ with Water.

        Thus at the Year's End, there will be _An Hundred Thousand
Pounds_ more Money in your Country.

        If Paper Money in ever so great a Quantity could be made, no
Man could get any of it without giving something for it.  But all he
saves in this Way, will be _his own for nothing_; and his Country
actually so much richer.  Then the Merchants old and doubtful Debts
may be honestly paid off, and Trading become surer thereafter, if not
so extensive.
                                 ______

        Laws _too gentle_ are seldom _obeyed_; _too severe_, seldom
_executed._

        _Trouble_ springs from _Idleness_; _Toil_ from _Ease._

        _Love_, and be _loved._

        A wise Man will desire no more, than what he may get justly,
use soberly, distribute chearfully, and leave contentedly.

        The diligent Spinner has a large Shift.

        A false Friend and a Shadow, attend only while the Sun shines.


        _To-morrow_, every Fault is to be amended; but that _To-morrow_
never comes.

        Plough deep, while Sluggards sleep;
        And you shall have Corn, to sell and to keep.

        He that sows Thorns, should never go barefoot.

        _Laziness_ travels so slowly, that _Poverty_ soon overtakes
him.

        _Sampson_ with his _strong Body_, had a _weak Head_, or he
would not have laid it in a Harlot's Lap.

        When a Friend deals with a Friend
        Let the Bargain be clear and well penn'd,
        That they may continue Friends to the End.

        He that never eats too much, will never be lazy.

        To be _proud_ of _Knowledge_, is to be _blind_ with _Light_; to
be _proud_ of _Virtue_, is to _poison_ yourself with the _Antidote._

        Get what you can, and what you get, hold;
        'Tis the _Stone_ that will turn all your Lead into Gold.

        An honest Man will receive neither _Money_ nor _Praise_, that
is not his Due.

        Well, my Friend, thou art now just entering the last Month of
another Year.  If thou art a Man of Business, and of prudent Care,
belike thou wilt now settle thy Accounts, to satisfy thyself whether
thou hast gain'd or lost in the Year past, and how much of either,
the better to regulate thy future Industry or thy common Expences.
This is commendable. -- But it is not all. -- Wilt thou not examine
also thy _moral_ Accompts, and see what Improvements thou hast made
in the Conduct of Life, what Vice subdued, what Virtue acquired; how
much _better_, and how much _wiser_, as well as how much _richer_
thou art grown?  What shall it _profit_ a Man, if he _gain_ the whole
World, and _lose_ his own Soul?  Without some Care in this Matter,
tho' thou may'st come to count thy Thousands, thou wilt possibly
still appear poor in the Eyes of the Discerning, even _here_, and be
really so for ever _hereafter._


        _Saying_ and _Doing_, have quarrel'd and parted.

        Tell me my Faults, and mend your own.
