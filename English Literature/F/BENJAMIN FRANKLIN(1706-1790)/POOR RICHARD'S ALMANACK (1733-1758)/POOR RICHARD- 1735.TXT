        _Poor Richard_
        1735

        _Courteous Reader,_
        This is the third Time of my appearing in print, hitherto very
much to my own Satisfaction, and, I have reason to hope, to the
Satisfaction of the Publick also; for the Publick is generous, and
has been very charitable and good to me.  I should be ungrateful
then, if I did not take every Opportunity of expressing my Gratitude;
for _ingratum si dixeris, omnia dixeris_: I therefore return the
Publick my most humble and hearty Thanks.

        Whatever may be the Musick of the Spheres, how great soever the
Harmony of the Stars, 'tis certain there is no Harmony among the
Stargazers; but they are perpetually growling and snarling at one
another like strange Curs, or like some Men at their Wives: I had
resolved to keep the Peace on my own part, and affront none of them;
and I shall persist in that Resolution: But having receiv'd much
Abuse from _Titan Leeds_ deceas'd, (_Titan Leeds_ when living would
not have us'd me so!) I say, having receiv'd much Abuse from the
Ghost of _Titan Leeds_, who pretends to be still living, and to write
Almanacks in spight of me and my Predictions, I cannot help saying,
that tho' I take it patiently, I take it very unkindly.  And whatever
he may pretend, 'tis undoubtedly true that he is really defunct and
dead.  First because the Stars are seldom disappointed, never but in
the Case of wise Men, _Sapiens dominabitur astris_, and they
foreshow'd his Death at the Time I predicted it.  Secondly, 'Twas
requisite and necessary he should die punctually at that Time, for
the Honour of Astrology, the Art professed both by him and his Father
before him.  Thirdly, 'Tis plain to every one that reads his two last
Almanacks (for 1734 and 35) that they are not written with that
_Life_ his Performances use to be written with; the Wit is low and
flat, the little Hints dull and spiritless, nothing smart in them but
_Hudibras_'s Verses against Astrology at the Heads of the Months in
the last, which no Astrologer but a _dead one_ would have inserted,
and no Man _living_ would or could write such Stuff as the rest.  But
lastly, I shall convince him from his own Words, that he is dead,
(_ex ore suo condemnatus est_) for in his Preface to his Almanack for
1734, he says, _"Saunders adds another_ GROSS FALSHOOD _in his
Almanack,_ viz. _that by my own Calculation I shall_ survive _until
the_ 26th _of the said Month October_ 1733, _which is as_ untrue _as
the former."_ Now if it be, as _Leeds_ says, _untrue_ and a _gross
Falshood_ that he surviv'd till the 26th of October 1733, then it is
certainly _true_ that he died _before_ that Time: And if he died
before that Time, he is dead now, to all Intents and Purposes, any
thing he may say to the contrary notwithstanding.  And at what Time
before the 26th is it so likely he should die, as at the Time by me
predicted, _viz._ the 17th of October aforesaid?  But if some People
will walk and be troublesome after Death, it may perhaps be born with
a little, because it cannot well be avoided unless one would be at
the Pains and Expence of laying them in the _Red Sea_; however, they
should not presume too much upon the Liberty allow'd them; I know
Confinement must needs be mighty irksome to the free Spirit of an
Astronomer, and I am too compassionate to proceed suddenly to
Extremities with it; nevertheless, tho' I resolve with Reluctance, I
shall not long defer, if it does not speedily learn to treat its
living Friends with better Manners.  I am,
