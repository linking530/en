        On the 7th of this month 1692 died _Robert Boyle_, Esq; one of
the greatest philosophers the last age produced.  He first brought
the machine called an _Airpump_, into use; by which many of the
surprizing properties of that wonderful element were discovered and
demonstrated.  His knowledge of natural history, and skill in
chymistry, were very great and extensive; and his piety inferior to
neither.

         is therefore an instance, that tho' _Ignorance_ may in some be the
_Mother of Devotion_, yet true learning and exalted piety are by no means
inconsistent.

        When we read in antient history of the speeches made by
generals to very numerous armies, we sometimes wonder how they could
be well heard; but supposing the men got together so close, that each
took up no more ground than two foot in breadth, and one in depth,
45000 might stand in a space that was but 100 yards square, and 21780
on a single acre of ground.  There are many voices that may be heard
at 100 yards distance.

        On the 18th of this month, _anno_ 1546 died that famous
reformer, LUTHER: who struck the great blow to papal tyranny in
_Europe._ He was remarkably _temperate_ in meat and drink, sometimes
fasting four days together; and at other times, for many days eating
only a little bread and a herring.  _Cicero_ says, _There was never
any_ great _man who was not an_ industrious _man_; to which may,
perhaps, be added, _There was never any_ industrious _man who was not
a_ temperate _man_: For intemperance in diet, abates the vigour and
dulls the action both of mind and body.

                                           OF SOUND.
        Mr. _Flamstead_, Dr. _Halley_ and Mr. _Derham_, agree that
sound moves 1142 feet in a second, which is one _English_ mile in 4
seconds and 5 8ths; that it moves in the same time in every different
state of the atmosphere; that winds hardly make any difference in its
velocity; that a languid or loud sound moves with the same velocity;
and that different kinds of sounds, as of bells, guns, &c. have the
same velocity, and are equally swift in the beginning as end of their
motion.

        The nose of a lady here, is not delighted with perfumes that
she understands are in _Arabia._ Fine musick in _China_ gives no
pleasure to the nicest ear in _Pennsilvania._ Nor does the most
exquisite dish serv'd up in _Japan_, regale a luxurious palate in any
other country.  But the benevolent mind of a virtuous man, is
pleas'd, when it is inform'd of good and generous actions, in what
part of the world soever they are done.

        On the 7th of this month, 1626, died that _great little_ man,
Sir FRANCIS BACON; _great_ in his prodigious genius, parts and
learning; and _little_, in his servile compliances with a _little_
court, and submissive flattery of a _little_ prince.  _Pope_
characterises him thus, in one strong line;

        _If Parts allure thee, think how_ BACON _shin'd,
        The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind._

        He is justly esteem'd the father of the modern experimental
philosophy.  And another poet treats him more favourably, ascribing
his blemishes to a wrong unfortunate choice of his way of Life;

        ------ BACON, hapless in his choice,
        Unfit to stand the civil storm of state,
        And thro' the smooth barbarity of courts,
        With firm, but pliant virtue, forward still
        To urge his course.  Him for the studious shade
        Kind nature form'd, deep, comprehensive, clear,
        Exact, and elegant; in one rich soul,
        PLATO, the STAGYRITE, and TULLY join'd.
        The great deliverer he! who from the gloom
        Of cloister'd monks, and jargon-teaching schools,
        Led forth the true Philosophy, there long
        Held in the magic chain of words and forms,
        And definitions void: He led her forth,
        Daughter of HEAV'N! that slow ascending still,
        Investigating sure the chain of things,
        With radiant finger points to HEAV'N again.

        On the 27th anno 1564, died at _Geneva_ that famous reformer,
Mr. _John Calvin_, A man of equal _temperance_ and _sobriety_ with
_Luther_, and perhaps yet greater _industry_.  His lectures were
yearly 186, his sermons yearly 286; he published besides every year
some great volume in folio; to which add his constant employments, in
governing the church, answering letters from all parts of the
reformed world, from pastors, concerning doubts, or asking ocunsel,
_&c. &c._ He ate little meat, and slept but very little; and as his
whole time was filled up with useful action, he may be said to have
_lived_ lon, tho' he died at _55_ years of age; since _sleep_ and
_sloth_ can hardly be called _living._

        It was wise counsel given to a young man, _Pitch upon that
course of life which is most excellent, and_ CUSTOM _will make it the
most delightful._ But many pitch on no course of life at all, nor
form any scheme of living, by which to attain any valuable end; but
wander perpetually from one thing to another.

        Hast thou not yet propos'd some certain end,
        To which thy life, thy every act may tend?
        Hast thou no mark at which to bend thy bow?
        Or like a boy pursu'st the carrion crow
        With pellets and with stones, from tree to tree,
        A fruitless toil, and liv'st _extempore_?

        Too late for cure, he proffers half his wealth;
        Ten thousand doctors cannot give him health.
        Learn, wretches, learn the motions of the mind,

        PRIDE is said to be the _last_ vice the good man gets clear of.
'Tis a meer _Proteus_, and disguises itself under all manner of
appearances, putting on sometimes even the mask of _humility._ If
some are proud of neatness and propriety of dress; others are equally
so of despising it, and acting the perpetual sloven.

        On the 25th of this month, _anno_ 1642, was born the great Sir
ISAAC NEWTON, prince of the modern astronomers and philosophers.  But
what is all our little boasted knowledge, compar'd with that of the
angels?  If they see our actions, and are acquainted with our
affairs, our whole body of science must appear to them as little
better than ignorance; and the common herd of our learned men, scarce
worth their notice.  Now and then one of our very great philosophers,
an _Aristotle_, or a _Newton_, may, perhaps, by his most refined
speculations, afford them a little entertainment, as it seems a
mimicking of their own sublime amusements.  Hence _Pope_ says of the
latter,

                 _Superior beings, when of late they saw
                 A mortal man unfold all nature's law,
                 Admir'd such wisdom in a human shape,
                 And shew'd a_ Newton, _as we shew an ape._

        How to get RICHES.

        The Art of getting Riches consists very much in THRIFT.  All Men
are not equally qualified for getting Money, but it is in the Power
of every one alike to practise this Virtue.

        He that would be beforehand in the World, must be beforehand
with his Business: It is not only ill Management, but discovers a
slothful Disposition, to do that in the Afternoon, which should have
been done in the Morning.

        Useful Attainments in your Minority will procure Riches in
Maturity, of which Writing and Accounts are not the meanest.

        Learning, whether Speculative or Practical, is, in Popular or
Mixt Governments, the Natural Source of Wealth and Honour.

        PRECEPT I.
        In Things of moment, on thy self depend,
        Nor trust too far thy Servant or thy Friend:
        With private Views, thy Friend may promise fair,
        And Servants very seldom prove sincere.

        PRECEPT II.
        What can be done, with Care perform to Day,
        Dangers unthought-of will attend Delay;
        Your distant Prospects all precarious are,
        And Fortune is as fickle as she's fair.

        PRECEPT III.
        Nor trivial Loss, nor trivial Gain despise;
        Molehills, if often heap'd, to Mountains rise:
        Weigh every small Expence, and nothing waste,
        Farthings long sav'd, amount to Pounds at last.
