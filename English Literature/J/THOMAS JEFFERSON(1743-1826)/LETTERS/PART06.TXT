        _To Ezra Stiles_

        _Paris, Sep. 1, 1786_




        SIR, -- I am honoured with your letter of May 8.  That which

you mention to have written in the winter preceding never came to

hand.  I return you my thanks for the communications relative to the

Western country.  When we reflect how long we have inhabited those

parts of America which lie between the Alleghaney & the ocean, that

no monument has ever been found in them which indicated the use of

iron among its' aboriginal inhabitants, that they were as far

advanced in arts, at least, as the inhabitants on the other side the

Alleghaney, a good degree of infidelity may be excused as to the new

discoveries which suppose regular fortifications of brickwork to have

been in use among the Indians on the waters of the Ohio.

Intrenchments of earth they might indeed make: but brick is more

difficult.  The art of making it may have preceded the use of iron,

but it would suppose a greater degree of industry than men in the

hunter state usually possess.  I should like to know whether General

Parsons himself saw actual bricks among the remains of fortification.

I suppose the settlement of our continent is of the most remote

antiquity.  The similitude between its' inhabitants & those of

Eastern parts of Asia renders it probable that ours are descended

from them or they from ours.  The latter is my opinion, founded on

this single fact.  Among the red inhabitants of Asia there are but a

few languages radically different, but among our Indians the number

of languages is infinite which are so radically different as to

exhibit at present no appearance of their having been derived from a

common source.  The time necessary for the generation of so many

languages must be immense.  A countryman of yours, a Mr. Lediard, who

was with Capt. Cook on his last voiage, proposes either to go to

Kamschatka, cross from thence to the Western side of America, and

penetrate through the Continent to our side of it, or to go to

Kentucke, & thence penetrate Westwardly to the South sea, the vent

from hence lately to London, where if he finds a passage to

Kamschatka or the Western coast of America he would avail himself of

it: otherwise he proposes to return to our side of America to attempt

that route.  I think him well calculated for such an enterprise, &

wish he may undertake it.  Another countryman of yours Mr. Trumbul

has paid us a visit here & brought with him two pictures which are

the admiration of the Connoisseurs.  His natural talents for this art

seem almost unparalleled.  I send you the 5th & 6th vols. of the

_Bibliotheque physico ecconomie_ erroneously lettered as the 7th &

8th, which are not yet come out.  I inclose with them the article

"Etats Unis" of the new Encyclopedie.  This article is recently

published, & a few copies have been printed separate.  For this

twelvemonth past little new & excellent has appeared either in

literature or the arts.  An Abbe Rochon has applied the metal called

platina to the telescope instead of the mixed metal of which the

specula were formerly composed.  It is insusceptible of rust, as gold

is, and he thinks it's reflective power equal to that of the mixed

metal.  He has observed a very curious effect of the natural

chrystals, & especially of those of Iceland; which is that lenses

made of them have two distinct focuses, and present you the object

distinctly at two different distances.  This I have seen myself.  A

new method of copying has been invented here.  I called on the

inventor, & he presented me a plate of copper, a pen & ink.  I wrote

a note on the plate, and in about three quarters of an hour he

brought me an hundred copies, as perfect as the imagination can

conceive.  Had I written my name, he could have put it to so many

bonds, so that I should have acknoleged the Signature to be my own.

The copying of paintings in England is very conceivable.  Any number

may be taken, which shall give you the true lineaments & colouring of

the original without injuring that.  This is so like creation, that

had I not seen it, I should have doubted it.  -- The death of the K.

of Prussia, which happened on the 17th inst. will probably employ the

pens, if not the swords of politicians.  We had exchanged the

ratifications of our treaty with him.  The articles of this which

were intended to prevent or miticate wars, by lessening their aliment

are so much applauded in Europe that I think the example will be

followed.  I have the honour to be with very sincere esteem, Dear

Sir, your most obedt. humble servant.







        "DIALOGUE BETWEEN MY HEAD & MY HEART"




        _To Maria Cosway_

        _Paris, October 12, 1786_




        MY DEAR MADAM, -- Having performed the last sad office of

handing you into your carriage at the pavillon de St. Denis, and seen

the wheels get actually into motion, I turned on my heel & walked,

more dead than alive, to the opposite door, where my own was awaiting

me.  Mr. Danquerville was missing.  He was sought for, found, &

dragged down stairs.  We were crammed into the carriage, like

recruits for the Bastille, & not having soul enough to give orders to

the coachman, he presumed Paris our destination, & drove off.  After

a considerable interval, silence was broke with a _"Je suis vraiment

afflige du depart de ces bons gens."_ This was a signal for a mutual

confession of distress.  We began immediately to talk of Mr.  & Mrs.

Cosway, of their goodness, their talents, their amiability; & tho we

spoke of nothing else, we seemed hardly to have entered into matter

when the coachman announced the rue St. Denis, & that we were

opposite Mr. Danquerville's.  He insisted on descending there &

traversing a short passage to his lodgings.  I was carried home.

Seated by my fireside, solitary & sad, the following dialogue took

place between my Head & my Heart:




        _Head._ Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.




        _Heart._ I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings.

Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its

natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe

should leave me no more to feel or to fear.




        _Head._ These are the eternal consequences of your warmth &

precipitation.  This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever

leading us.  You confess your follies indeed; but still you hug &

cherish them; & no reformation can be hoped, where there is no

repentance.




        _Heart._ Oh, my friend! this is no moment to upbraid my

foibles.  I am rent into fragments by the force of my grief!  If you

have any balm, pour it into my wounds; if none, do not harrow them by

new torments.  Spare me in this awful moment!  At any other I will

attend with patience to your admonitions.




        _Head._ On the contrary I never found that the moment of

triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions.

While suffering under your follies, you may perhaps be made sensible

of them, but, the paroxysm over, you fancy it can never return.

Harsh therefore as the medicine may be, it is my office to administer

it.  You will be pleased to remember that when our friend Trumbull

used to be telling us of the merits & talents of these good people, I

never ceased whispering to you that we had no occasion for new

acquaintance; that the greater their merits & talents, the more

dangerous their friendship to our tranquillity, because the regret at

parting would be greater.




        _Heart._ Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the

consequence of my doings.  It was one of your projects which threw us

in the way of it.  It was you, remember, & not I, who desired the

meeting at Legrand & Molinos.  I never trouble myself with domes nor

arches.  The Halle aux bleds might have rotted down before I should

have gone to see it.  But you, forsooth, who are eternally getting us

to sleep with your diagrams & crotchets, must go & examine this

wonderful piece of architecture.  And when you had seen it, oh! it

was the most superb thing on earth!  What you had seen there was

worth all you had yet seen in Paris!  I thought so too.  But I meant

it of the lady & gentleman to whom we had been presented; & not of a

parcel of sticks & chips put together in pens.  You then, Sir, & not

I, have been the cause of the present distress.




        _Head._ It would have been happy for you if my diagrams &

crotchets had gotten you to sleep on that day, as you are pleased to

say they eternally do.  My visit to Legrand & Molinos had public

utility for it's object.  A market is to be built in Richmond.  What

a commodious plan is that of Legrand & Molinos; especially if we put

on it the noble dome of the Halle aux bleds.  If such a bridge as

they shewed us can be thrown across the Schuylkill at Philadelphia,

the floating bridges taken up & the navigation of that river opened,

what a copious resource will be added, of wood & provisions, to warm

& feed the poor of that city?  While I was occupied with these

objects, you were dilating with your new acquaintances, & contriving

how to prevent a separation from them.  Every soul of you had an

engagement for the day.  Yet all these were to be sacrificed, that

you might dine together.  Lying messengers were to be despatched into

every quarter of the city, with apologies for your breach of

engagement.  You particularly had the effrontery to send word to the

Dutchess Danville that, on the moment we were setting out to dine

with her, despatches came to hand which required immediate attention.

You wanted me to invent a more ingenious excuse; but I knew you were

getting into a scrape, & I would have nothing to do with it.  Well,

after dinner to St. Cloud, from St. Cloud to Ruggieri's, from

Ruggieri to Krumfoltz, & if the day had been as long as a Lapland

summer day, you would still have contrived means among you to have

filled it.




 

        _Heart._ Oh! my dear friend, how you have revived me by

recalling to my mind the transactions of that day!  How well I

remember them all, & that when I came home at night & looked back to

the morning, it seemed to have been a month agone.  Go on then, like

a kind comforter & paint to me the day we went to St. Germains.  How

beautiful was every object! the Port de Reuilly, the hills along the

Seine, the rainbows of the machine of Marly, the terrace of St.

Germains, the chateaux, the gardens, the statues of Marly, the

pavillon of Lucienne.  Recollect too Madrid, Bagatelle, the King's

garden, the Dessert.  How grand the idea excited by the remains of

such a column!  The spiral staircase too was beautiful.  Every moment

was filled with something agreeable.  The wheels of time moved on

with a rapidity of which those of our carriage gave but a faint idea.

And yet in the evening when one took a retrospect of the day, what a

mass of happiness had we travelled over!  Retrace all those scenes to

me, my good companion, & I will forgive the unkindness with which you

were chiding me.  The day we went to St. Germains was a little too

warm, I think; was it not?




        _Head._ Thou art the most incorrigible of all the beings that

ever sinned!  I reminded you of the follies of the first day,

intending to deduce from thence some useful lessons for you, but

instead of listening to these, you kindle at the recollection, you

retrace the whole series with a fondness which shews you want nothing

but the opportunity to act it over again.  I often told you during

its course that you were imprudently engaging your affections under

circumstances that must have cost you a great deal of pain: that the

persons indeed were of the greatest merit, possessing good sense,

good humour, honest hearts, honest manners, & eminence in a lovely

art; that the lady had moreover qualities & accomplishments,

belonging to her sex, which might form a chapter apart for her: such

as music, modesty, beauty, & that softness of disposition which is

the ornament of her sex & charm of ours, but that all these

considerations would increase the pang of separation: that their stay

here was to be short: that you rack our whole system when you are

parted from those you love, complaining that such a separation is

worse than death, inasmuch as this ends our sufferings, whereas that

only begins them: & that the separation would in this instance be the

more severe as you would probably never see them again.




        _Heart._ But they told me they would come back again the next

year.




        _Head._ But in the meantime see what you suffer: & their return

too depends on so many circumstances that if you had a grain of

prudence you would not count upon it.  Upon the whole it is

improbable & therefore you should abandon the idea of ever seeing

them again.




        _Heart._ May heaven abandon me if I do!




        _Head._ Very well.  Suppose then they come back.  They are to

stay two months, & when these are expired, what is to follow?

Perhaps you flatter yourself they may come to America?




        _Heart._ God only knows what is to happen.  I see nothing

impossible in that supposition.  And I see things wonderfully

contrived sometimes to make us happy.  Where could they find such

objects as in America for the exercise of their enchanting art?

especially the lady, who paints landscapes so inimitably.  She wants

only subjects worthy of immortality to render her pencil immortal.

The Falling Spring, the Cascade of Niagara, the Passage of the

Potowmac through the Blue Mountains, the Natural bridge.  It is worth

a voyage across the Atlantic to see these objects; much more to

paint, and make them, & thereby ourselves, known to all ages.  And

our own dear Monticello, where has nature spread so rich a mantle

under the eye? mountains, forests, rocks, rivers.  With what majesty

do we there ride above the storms!  How sublime to look down into the

workhouse of nature, to see her clouds, hail, snow, rain, thunder,

all fabricated at our feet! and the glorious sun when rising as if

out of a distant water, just gilding the tops of the mountains, &

giving life to all nature!  I hope in God no circumstance may ever

make either seek an asylum from grief!  With what sincere sympathy I

would open every cell of my composition to receive the effusion of

their woes!  I would pour my tears into their wounds: & if a drop of

balm could be found on the top of the Cordilleras, or at the remotest

sources of the Missouri, I would go thither myself to seek & to bring

it.  Deeply practised in the school of affliction, the human heart

knows no joy which I have not lost, no sorrow of which I have not

drunk!  Fortune can present no grief of unknown form to me!  Who then

can so softly bind up the wound of another as he who has felt the

same wound himself?  But Heaven forbid they should ever know a

sorrow!  Let us turn over another leaf, for this has distracted me.




        _Head._ Well.  Let us put this possibility to trial then on

another point.  When you consider the character which is given of our

country by the lying newspapers of London, & their credulous copyers

in other countries; when you reflect that all Europe is made to

believe we are a lawless banditti, in a state of absolute anarchy,

cutting one another's throats, & plundering without distinction, how

can you expect that any reasonable creature would venture among us?




        _Heart._ But you & I know that all this is false: that there is

not a country on earth where there is greater tranquillity, where the

laws are milder, or better obeyed: where every one is more attentive

to his own business, or meddles less with that of others: where

strangers are better received, more hospitably treated, & with a more

sacred respect.




        _Head._ True, you & I know this, but your friends do not know

it.




        _Heart._ But they are sensible people who think for themselves.

They will ask of impartial foreigners who have been among us, whether

they saw or heard on the spot any instances of anarchy.  They will

judge too that a people occupied as we are in opening rivers, digging

navigable canals, making roads, building public schools, establishing

academies, erecting busts & statues to our great men, protecting

religious freedom, abolishing sanguinary punishments, reforming &

improving our laws in general, they will judge I say for themselves

whether these are not the occupations of a people at their ease,

whether this is not better evidence of our true state than a London

newspaper, hired to lie, & from which no truth can ever be extracted

but by reversing everything it says.




        _Head._ I did not begin this lecture my friend with a view to

learn from you what America is doing.  Let us return then to our

point.  I wished to make you sensible how imprudent it is to place

your affections, without reserve, on objects you must so soon lose, &

whose loss when it comes must cost you such severe pangs.  Remember

the last night.  You knew your friends were to leave Paris to-day.

This was enough to throw you into agonies.  All night you tossed us

from one side of the bed to the other.  No sleep, no rest.  The poor

crippled wrist too, never left one moment in the same position, now

up, now down, now here, now there; was it to be wondered at if it's

pains returned?  The Surgeon then was to be called, & to be rated as

an ignoramus because he could not divine the cause of this

extraordinary change.  In fine, my friend, you must mend your

manners.  This is not a world to live at random in as you do.  To

avoid those eternal distresses, to which you are forever exposing us,

you must learn to look forward before you take a step which may

interest our peace.  Everything in this world is a matter of

calculation.  Advance then with caution, the balance in your hand.

Put into one scale the pleasures which any object may offer; but put

fairly into the other the pains which are to follow, & see which

preponderates.  The making an acquaintance is not a matter of

indifference.  When a new one is proposed to you, view it all round.

Consider what advantages it presents, & to what inconveniences it may

expose you.  Do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there

is no hook beneath it.  The art of life is the art of avoiding pain:

& he is the best pilot who steers clearest of the rocks & shoals with

which he is beset.  Pleasure is always before us; but misfortune is

at our side: while running after that, this arrests us.  The most

effectual means of being secure against pain is to retire within

ourselves, & to suffice for our own happiness.  Those, which depend

on ourselves, are the only pleasures a wise man will count on: for

nothing is ours which another may deprive us of.  Hence the

inestimable value of intellectual pleasures.  Even in our power,

always leading us to something new, never cloying, we ride serene &

sublime above the concerns of this mortal world, contemplating truth

& nature, matter & motion, the laws which bind up their existence, &

that eternal being who made & bound them up by those laws.  Let this

be our employ.  Leave the bustle & tumult of society to those who

have not talents to occupy themselves without them.  Friendship is

but another name for an alliance with the follies & the misfortunes

of others.  Our own share of miseries is sufficient: why enter then

as volunteers into those of another?  Is there so little gall poured

into our cup that we must needs help to drink that of our neighbor?

A friend dies or leaves us: we feel as if a limb was cut off.  He is

sick: we must watch over him, & participate of his pains.  His

fortune is shipwrecked; ours must be laid under contribution.  He

loses a child, a parent, or a partner: we must mourn the loss as if

it were our own.




        _Heart._ And what more sublime delight than to mingle tears

with one whom the hand of heaven hath smitten! to watch over the bed

of sickness, & to beguile it's tedious & it's painful moments! to

share our bread with one to whom misfortune has left none!  This

world abounds indeed with misery: to lighten it's burthen we must

divide it with one another.  But let us now try the virtues of your

mathematical balance, & as you have put into one scale the burthen of

friendship, let me put it's comforts into the other.  When

languishing then under disease, how grateful is the solace of our

friends! how are we penetrated with their assiduities & attentions!

how much are we supported by their encouragements & kind offices!

When heaven has taken from us some object of our love, how sweet is

it to have a bosom whereon to recline our heads, & into which we may

pour the torrent of our tears!  Grief, with such a comfort, is almost

a luxury!  In a life where we are perpetually exposed to want &

accident, yours is a wonderful proposition, to insulate ourselves, to

retire from all aid, & to wrap ourselves in the mantle of

self-sufficiency!  For assuredly nobody will care for him who cares

for nobody.  But friendship is precious, not only in the shade but in

the sunshine of life; & thanks to a benevolent arrangement of things,

the greater part of life is sunshine.  I will recur for proof to the

days we have lately passed.  On these indeed the sun shone brightly.

How gay did the face of nature appear!  Hills, valleys, chateaux,

gardens, rivers, every object wore it's liveliest hue!  Whence did

they borrow it?  From the presence of our charming companion.  They

were pleasing, because she seemed pleased.  Alone, the scene would

have been dull & insipid: the participation of it with her gave it

relish.  Let the gloomy monk, sequestered from the world, seek

unsocial pleasures in the bottom of his cell!  Let the sublimated

philosopher grasp visionary happiness while pursuing phantoms dressed

in the garb of truth!  Their supreme wisdom is supreme folly; & they

mistake for happiness the mere absence of pain.  Had they ever felt

the solid pleasure of one generous spasm of the heart, they would

exchange for it all the frigid speculations of their lives, which you

have been vaunting in such elevated terms.  Believe me then my

friend, that that is a miserable arithmetic which could estimate

friendship at nothing, or at less than nothing.  Respect for you has

induced me to enter into this discussion, & to hear principles

uttered which I detest & abjure.  Respect for myself now obliges me

to recall you into the proper limits of your office.  When nature

assigned us the same habitation, she gave us over it a divided

empire.  To you she allotted the field of science; to me that of

morals.  When the circle is to be squared, or the orbit of a comet to

be traced; when the arch of greatest strength, or the solid of least

resistance is to be investigated, take up the problem; it is yours;

nature has given me no cognizance of it.  In like manner, in denying

to you the feelings of sympathy, of benevolence, of gratitude, of

justice, of love, of friendship, she has excluded you from their

controul.  To these she has adapted the mechanism of the heart.

Morals were too essential to the happiness of man to be risked on the

incertain combinations of the head.  She laid their foundation

therefore in sentiment, not in science.  That she gave to all, as

necessary to all: this to a few only, as sufficing with a few.  I

know indeed that you pretend authority to the sovereign controul of

our conduct in all its parts: & a respect for your grave saws &

maxims, a desire to do what is right, has sometimes induced me to

conform to your counsels.  A few facts however which I can readily

recall to your memory, will suffice to prove to you that nature has

not organized you for our moral direction.  When the poor wearied

souldier whom we overtook at Chickahomony with his pack on his back,

begged us to let him get up behind our chariot, you began to

calculate that the road was full of souldiers, & that if all should

be taken up our horses would fail in their journey.  We drove on

therefore.  But soon becoming sensible you had made me do wrong, that

tho we cannot relieve all the distressed we should relieve as many as

we can, I turned about to take up the souldier; but he had entered a

bye path, & was no more to be found; & from that moment to this I

could never find him out to ask his forgiveness.  Again, when the

poor woman came to ask a charity in Philadelphia, you whispered that

she looked like a drunkard, & that half a dollar was enough to give

her for the ale-house.  Those who want the dispositions to give,

easily find reasons why they ought not to give.  When I sought her

out afterwards, & did what I should have done at first, you know that

she employed the money immediately towards placing her child at

school.  If our country, when pressed with wrongs at the point of the

bayonet, had been governed by it's heads instead of it's hearts,

where should we have been now?  Hanging on a gallows as high as

Haman's.  You began to calculate & to compare wealth and numbers: we

threw up a few pulsations of our warmest blood; we supplied

enthusiasm against wealth and numbers; we put our existence to the

hazard when the hazard seemed against us, and we saved our country:

justifying at the same time the ways of Providence, whose precept is

to do always what is right, and leave the issue to him.  In short, my

friend, as far as my recollection serves me, I do not know that I

ever did a good thing on your suggestion, or a dirty one without it.

I do forever then disclaim your interference in my province.  Fill

papers as you please with triangles & squares: try how many ways you

can hang & combine them together.  I shall never envy nor controul

your sublime delights.  But leave me to decide when & where

friendships are to be contracted.  You say I contract them at random.

So you said the woman at Philadelphia was a drunkard.  I receive no

one into my esteem till I know they are worthy of it.  Wealth, title,

office, are no recommendations to my friendship.  On the contrary

great good qualities are requisite to make amends for their having

wealth, title, & office.  You confess that in the present case I

could not have made a worthier choice.  You only object that I was so

soon to lose them.  We are not immortal ourselves, my friend; how can

we expect our enjoyments to be so?  We have no rose without it's

thorn; no pleasure without alloy.  It is the law of our existence; &

we must acquiesce.  It is the condition annexed to all our pleasures,

not by us who receive, but by him who gives them.  True, this

condition is pressing cruelly on me at this moment.  I feel more fit

for death than life.  But when I look back on the pleasures of which

it is the consequence, I am conscious they were worth the price I am

paying.  Notwithstanding your endeavours too to damp my hopes, I

comfort myself with expectations of their promised return.  Hope is

sweeter than despair, & they were too good to mean to deceive me.  In

the summer, said the gentleman; but in the spring, said the lady: & I

should love her forever, were it only for that!  Know then, my

friend, that I have taken these good people into my bosom; that I

have lodged them in the warmest cell I could find: that I love them,

& will continue to love them through life: that if fortune should

dispose them on one side the globe, & me on the other, my affections

shall pervade it's whole mass to reach them.  Knowing then my

determination, attempt not to disturb it.  If you can at any time

furnish matter for their amusement, it will be the office of a good

neighbor to do it.  I will in like manner seize any occasion which

may offer to do the like good turn for you with Condorcet,

Rittenhouse, Madison, La Cretelle, or any other of those worthy sons

of science whom you so justly prize.




        I thought this a favorable proposition whereon to rest the

issue of the dialogue.  So I put an end to it by calling for my

night-cap.  Methinks I hear you wish to heaven I had called a little

sooner, & so spared you the ennui of such a sermon.  I did not

interrupt them sooner because I was in a mood for hearing sermons.

You too were the subject; & on such a thesis I never think the theme

long; not even if I am to write it, and that slowly & awkwardly, as

now, with the left hand.  But that you may not be discouraged from a

correspondence which begins so formidably, I will promise you on my

honour that my future letters shall be of a reasonable length.  I

will even agree to express but half my esteem for you, for fear of

cloying you with too full a dose.  But, on your part, no curtailing.

If your letters are as long as the bible, they will appear short to

me.  Only let them be brimful of affection.  I shall read them with

the dispositions with which Arlequin, in _Les deux billets_ spelt the

words "_je t'aime_," and wished that the whole alphabet had entered

into their composition.




        We have had incessant rains since your departure.  These make

me fear for your health, as well as that you had an uncomfortable

journey.  The same cause has prevented me from being able to give you

any account of your friends here.  This voyage to Fontainebleau will

probably send the Count de Moustier & the Marquise de Brehan to

America.  Danquerville promised to visit me, but has not done it as

yet.  De la Tude comes sometimes to take family soup with me, &

entertains me with anecdotes of his five & thirty years imprisonment.

How fertile is the mind of man which can make the Bastile & Dungeon

of Vincennes yield interesting anecdotes!  You know this was for

making four verses on Mme de Pompadour.  But I think you told me you

did not know the verses.  They were these: _"Sans esprit, sans

sentiment, Sans etre belle, ni neuve, En France on peut avoir le

premier amant: Pompadour en est l' epreuve."_ I have read the memoir

of his three escapes.  As to myself my health is good, except my

wrist which mends slowly, & my mind which mends not at all, but

broods constantly over your departure.  The lateness of the season

obliges me to decline my journey into the south of France.  Present

me in the most friendly terms to Mr. Cosway, & receive me into your

own recollection with a partiality & a warmth, proportioned, not to

my own poor merit, but to the sentiments of sincere affection &

esteem with which I have the honour to be, my dear Madam, your most

obedient humble servant.







        HOMER, NEW JERSEY FARMERS, AND THE WHEEL




        _To St. John de Crevecoeur_

        _Paris, January 15, 1787_




        DEAR SIR, -- I see by the Journal of this morning, that they

are robbing us of another of our inventions to give it to the

English.  The writer, indeed, only admits them to have revived what

he thinks was known to the Greeks, that is, the making the

circumference of a wheel of one single piece.  The farmers in New

Jersey were the first who practised it, and they practised it

commonly.  Dr. Franklin, in one of his trips to London, mentioned

this practice to the man now in London, who has the patent for making

those wheels.  The idea struck him.  The Doctor promised to go to his

shop, and assist him in trying to make the wheel of one piece.  The

Jersey farmers do it by cutting a young sapling, and bending it,

while green and juicy, into a circle; and leaving it so until it

becomes perfectly seasoned.  But in London there are no saplings.

The difficulty was, then, to give to old wood the pliancy of young.

The Doctor and the workman labored together some weeks, and

succeeded; and the man obtained a patent for it, which has made his

fortune.  I was in his shop in London, he told me the whole story

himself, and acknowledged, not only the origin of the idea, but how

much the assistance of Dr. Franklin had contributed to perform the

operation on dry wood.  He spoke of him with love and gratitude.  I

think I have had a similar account from Dr. Franklin, but cannot be

quite certain.  I know, that being in Philadelphia when the first set

of patent wheels arrived from London, and were spoken of by the

gentleman (an Englishman) who brought them, as a wonderful discovery,

the idea of its being a new discovery was laughed at by the

Philadelphians, who, in their Sunday parties across the Delaware, had

seen every farmer's cart mounted on such wheels.  The writer in the

paper, supposes the English workman got his idea from Homer.  But it

is more likely the Jersey farmer got his idea from thence, because

ours are the only farmers who can read Homer; because, too, the

Jersey practice is precisely that stated by Homer: the English

practice very different.  Homer's words are (comparing a young hero

killed by Ajax to a poplar felled by a workman) literally thus: `He

fell on the ground, like a poplar, which has grown smooth, in the

west part of a great meadow; with its branches shooting from its

summit.  But the chariot maker, with his sharp axe, has felled it,

that he may bend a wheel for a beautiful chariot.  It lies drying on

the banks of the river.' Observe the circumstances which coincide

with the Jersey practice.  1. It is a tree growing in a moist place,

full of juices and easily bent.  2. It is cut while green.  3. It is

bent into the circumference of a wheel.  4. It is left to dry in that

form.  You, who write French well and readily, should write a line

for the Journal, to reclaim the honor of our farmers.  Adieu.  Yours

affectionately,







        "THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY CENSORS . . ."




        _To Edward Carrington_

        _Paris, Jan. 16, 1787_




        DEAR SIR, -- Uncertain whether you might be at New York at the

moment of Colo. Franks's arrival, I have inclosed my private letters

for Virginia under cover to our delegation in general, which

otherwise I would have taken the liberty to inclose particularly to

you, as best acquainted with the situation of the persons to whom

they are addressed.  Should this find you at New York, I will still

ask your attention to them.  The two large packages addressed to

Colo. N. Lewis contain seeds, not valuable enough to pay passage, but

which I would wish to be sent by the stage, or any similar quick

conveyance.  The letters to Colo. Lewis & Mr. Eppes (who take care of

my affairs) are particularly interesting to me.  The package for

Colo. Richd. Cary our judge of Admiralty near Hampton, contains seeds

& roots, not to be sent by Post.  Whether they had better go by the

stage, or by water, you will be the best judge.  I beg your pardon

for giving you this trouble.  But my situation & your goodness will I

hope excuse it.  In my letter to Mr. Jay, I have mentioned the

meeting of the Notables appointed for the 29th inst.  It is now put

off to the 7th or 8th of next month.  This event, which will hardly

excite any attention in America, is deemed here the most important

one which has taken place in their civil line during the present

century.  Some promise their country great things from it, some

nothing.  Our friend de La Fayette was placed on the list originally.

Afterwards his name disappeared; but finally was reinstated.  This

shews that his character here is not considered as an indifferent

one; and that it excites agitation.  His education in our school has

drawn on him a very jealous eye from a court whose principles are the

most absolute despotism.  But I hope he has nearly passed his crisis.

The King, who is a good man, is favorably disposed towards him: & he

is supported by powerful family connections, & by the public good

will.  He is the youngest man of the Notables except one whose office

placed him on the list.




        The Count de Vergennes has within these ten days had a very

severe attack of what is deemed an unfixed gout.  He has been well

enough however to do business to-day.  But anxieties for him are not

yet quieted.  He is a great & good minister, and an accident to him

might endanger the peace of Europe.




        The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in

Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state.  But it has

not.  On the contrary, the small effect of these tumults seems to

have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments.  The

interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has

had a great effect on the opinion here.  I am persuaded myself that

the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best

army.  They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct

themselves.  The people are the only censors of their governors: and

even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of

their institution.  To punish these errors too severely would be to

suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty.  The way to

prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them

full information of their affairs thro' the channel of the public

papers, & to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole

mass of the people.  The basis of our governments being the opinion

of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right;

and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government

without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not

hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.  But I should mean that every

man should receive those papers & be capable of reading them.  I am

convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without

government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree

of happiness than those who live under the European governments.

Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, & restrains

morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere.  Among the latter,

under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two

classes, wolves & sheep.  I do not exaggerate.  This is a true

picture of Europe.  Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and

keep alive their attention.  Do not be too severe upon their errors,

but reclaim them by enlightening them.  If once they become

inattentive to the public affairs, you & I, & Congress & Assemblies,

judges & governors shall all become wolves.  It seems to be the law

of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions; and

experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own

kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe,

and to the general prey of the rich on the poor.  The want of news

has led me into disquisition instead of narration, forgetting you

have every day enough of that.  I shall be happy to hear from you

sometimes, only observing that whatever passes thro' the post is

read, & that when you write what should be read by myself only, you

must be so good as to confide your letter to some passenger or

officer of the packet.  I will ask your permission to write to you

sometimes, and to assure you of the esteem & respect with which I

have honour to be Dear Sir your most obedient & most humble servt.







        REBELLION, SECESSION, AND DIPLOMACY




        _To James Madison_

        _Paris, Jan. 30, 1787_




        DEAR SIR, -- My last to you was of the 16th of Dec, since which

I have received yours of Nov 25, & Dec 4, which afforded me, as your

letters always do, a treat on matters public, individual &

oeconomical.  I am impatient to learn your sentiments on the late

troubles in the Eastern states.  So far as I have yet seen, they do

not appear to threaten serious consequences.  Those states have

suffered by the stoppage of the channels of their commerce, which

have not yet found other issues.  This must render money scarce, and

make the people uneasy.  This uneasiness has produced acts absolutely

unjustifiable; but I hope they will provoke no severities from their

governments.  A consciousness of those in power that their

administration of the public affairs has been honest, may perhaps

produce too great a degree of indignation: and those characters

wherein fear predominates over hope may apprehend too much from these

instances of irregularity.  They may conclude too hastily that nature

has formed man insusceptible of any other government but that of

force, a conclusion not founded in truth, nor experience.  Societies

exist under three forms sufficiently distinguishable.  1.  Without

government, as among our Indians.  2. Under governments wherein the

will of every one has a just influence, as is the case in England in

a slight degree, and in our states, in a great one.  3.  Under

governments of force: as is the case in all other monarchies and in

most of the other republics.  To have an idea of the curse of

existence under these last, they must be seen.  It is a government of

wolves over sheep.  It is a problem, not clear in my mind, that the

1st condition is not the best.  But I believe it to be inconsistent

with any great degree of population.  The second state has a great

deal of good in it.  The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious

degree of liberty & happiness.  It has it's evils too: the principal

of which is the turbulence to which it is subject.  But weigh this

against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing.  _Malo

periculosam libertatem quam quietam servitutem_.  Even this evil is

productive of good.  It prevents the degeneracy of government, and

nourishes a general attention to the public affairs. I hold it that a

little rebellion now and then is a good thing, & as necessary in the

political world as storms in the physical.  Unsuccessful rebellions

indeed generally establish the encroachments on the rights of the

people which have produced them.  An observation of this truth should

render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of

rebellions, as not to discourage them too much.  It is a medicine

necessary for the sound health of government.  If these transactions

give me no uneasiness, I feel very differently at another piece of

intelligence, to wit, the possibility that the navigation of the

Mississippi may be abandoned to Spain.  I never had any interest

Westward of the Alleghaney; & I never will have any.  But I have had

great opportunities of knowing the character of the people who

inhabit that country.  And I will venture to say that the act which

abandons the navigation of the Mississippi is an act of separation

between the Eastern & Western country.  It is a relinquishment of

five parts out of eight of the territory of the United States, an

abandonment of the fairest subject for the paiment of our public

debts, & the chaining those debts on our own necks _in perpetuum_.  I

have the utmost confidence in the honest intentions of those who

concur in this measure; but I lament their want of acquaintance with

the character & physical advantages of the people who, right or

wrong, will suppose their interests sacrificed on this occasion to

the contrary interests of that part of the confederacy in possession

of present power.  If they declare themselves a separate people, we

are incapable of a single effort to retain them.  Our citizens can

never be induced, either as militia or as souldiers, to go there to

cut the throats of their own brothers & sons, or rather to be

themselves the subjects instead of the perpetrators of the parricide.

Nor would that country requite the cost of being retained against the

will of it's inhabitants, could it be done.  But it cannot be done.

They are able already to rescue the navigation of the Mississippi out

of the hands of Spain, & to add New Orleans to their own territory.

They will be joined by the inhabitants of Louisiana.  This will bring

on a war between them & Spain; and that will produce the question

with us whether it will not be worth our while to become parties with

them in the war, in order to reunite them with us, & thus correct our

error? & were I to permit my forebodings to go one step further, I

should predict that the inhabitants of the U S would force their

rulers to take the affirmative of that question.  I wish I may be

mistaken in all these opinions.




        We have for some time expected that the Chevalier de la Luzerne

would obtain a promotion in the diplomatic line, by being appointed

to some of the courts where this country keeps an ambassador.  But

none of the vacancies taking place which had been counted on, I think

the present disposition is to require his return to his station in

America.  He told me himself lately, that he should return in the

spring.  I have never pressed this matter on the court, tho' I knew

it to be desirable and desired on our part; because if the compulsion

on him to return had been the work of Congress, he would have

returned in such ill temper with them, as to disappoint them in the

good they expected from it.  He would forever have laid at their door

his failure of promotion.  I did not press it for another reason,

which is that I have great reason to believe that the character of

the Count de Moustier, who would go were the Chevalier to be

otherwise provided for, would give the most perfect satisfaction in

America.




 

        As you are now returned into Congress it will become of

importance that you should form a just estimate of certain public

characters: on which therefore I will give you such notes as my

knolege of them has furnished me with.  You will compare them with

the materials you are otherwise possessed of, and decide on a view of

the whole.  You know the opinion I _formerly_ entertained of _my

friend Mr_. _Adams_.  Yourself & the governor were the first who

_shook_ that opinion.  I afterwards saw proofs which _convicted him_

of a degree of _vanity_, and of a _blindness_ to it, of which no germ

_had appeared_ in Congress.  A 7-_month's_ intimacy with him _here_

and _as_ many _weeks_ in _London_ have given me opportunities of

studying him closely.  _He is vain,_ _irritable and a bad calculator

of_ the force & probable effect of the motives which govern men.

This is _all_ the _ill_ which can possibly be _said of him_.  He is

as disinterested as the being which made him: he is profound in his

views: and accurate in his judgment _except where knowledge of the

world_ is necessary to form a judgment.  He is so amiable, that I

pronounce you will love him, if ever you become acquainted with him.

He would be, as he was, a great man in _Congress_.  _Mr_.

_Carmichael_, is, I think, very little _known_ in _America_.  I never

_saw him_, & while I was _in Congress I_ formed rather a

_disadvantageous idea_ of him.  His letters, received then, showed

him _vain_, & more attentive to _ceremony & etiquette_ than we

suppose men _of sense_ should be.  _I_ have now a constant

correspondence with him, and find _him_ a little _hypochondriac_ and

_discontented_.  He possesses very _good understanding_, tho' not of

the _first order_.  _I have_ had great opportunities of _searching

into_ his _character_, and have availed myself _of them_.  Many

persons of different nations, _coming_ from _Madrid_ to _Paris_, all

speak of _him as_ in _high esteem_, & _I think_ it certain that he

has more of the _Count de Florida Blanca's friendship_, than any

_diplomatic_ character at _that court_.  As long as this _minister_

is in _office_, _Carmichael_ can do _more than_ any other _person

who_ could be _sent there_.  You will see _Franks_, _and_ doubtless

he will be _asking some appointment_.  I wish there may be any one

for _which_ he is _fit_.  He is _light, indiscreet, active, honest,

affectionate_.  Tho' _Bingham_ is not in _diplomatic office_, yet as

he wishes to be so, I will mention such circumstances of _him_, _as

you might_ otherwise be _deceived in_.  _He will_ make _you believe

he_ was on the most intimate footing with the first _characters in

Europe_, & versed in the _secrets_ of every _cabinet_.  Not a word of

this _is true_.  _He_ had a rage for being _presented_ to _great

men_, & had no _modesty_ in the methods by which he could if _he

attained acquaintance_.  Afterwards it was with such 90 who were

susceptible of impression from the _beauty of his wife_.  I must

_except_ the Marquis de Bonclearren who had been an _old

acquaintance_.




        The _Marquis de La Fayette_ is a most valuable _auxiliary to

me_.  His _zeal_ is unbounded, & his _weight_ with those in _power_,

_great_.  His _education_ having been merely _military_, _commerce_

was an unknown field to him.  But his good sense enabling him to

_comprehend_ perfectly whatever is _explained to him_, _his agency_

has been very _efficacious_.  _He_ has a great deal of _sound

genius_, is well _remarked_ by the _King_, & rising in _popularity_.

_He_ has nothing against _him_, _but_ the _suspicion_ of _republican

principles_.  I think he will one day _be of_ the _ministry_.  His

foible is, a _canine appetite for popularity and fame_; but he will

get _above_ this.  _The Count de Vergennes_ is _ill_.  The

possibility of his _recovery_, renders it dangerous for _us to

express a doubt of it: but_ he is _in danger_.  He is _a great

minister_ in _European affairs_, but has very _imperfect ideas_ of

_our institutions_, _and no confidence in_ them.  His _devotion_ to

the principles of _pure despotism_, renders him _unaffectionate to

our governments_.  But _his fear_ of _England makes him value us_ as

a _make weight_.  He is _cool, reserved in political conversations,

but free and familiar_ on other _subjects_, and a very _attentive,

agreeable person_ to _do business with_.  It is _impossible_ to have

a clearer, better _organized head_; but _age_ has _chilled his

heart_.  Nothing should be spared, on our part, to attach this

country to us.  It is the only one on which we can rely for support,

under every event.  Its inhabitants love us more, I think, than they

do any other nation on earth.  This is very much the effect of the

good dispositions with which the French officers returned.  In a

former letter, I mentioned to you the dislocation of my wrist.  I can

make not the least use of it, except for the single article of

writing, though it is going on five months since the accident

happened.  I have great anxieties, lest I should never recover any

considerable use of it.  I shall, by the advice of my surgeons, set

out in a fortnight for the waters of Aix, in Provence.  I chose these

out of several they proposed to me, because if they fail to be

effectual, my journey will not be useless altogether.  It will give

me an opportunity of examining the canal of Languedoc, and of

acquiring knowledge of that species of navigation, which may be

useful hereafter; but more immediately, it will enable me to make the

tour of the ports concerned in commerce with us, to examine, on the

spot, the defects of the late regulations respecting our commerce, to

learn the further improvements which may be made in it, and on my

return, to get this business finished.  I shall be absent between two

and three months, unless anything happens to recall me here sooner,

which may always be effected in ten days, in whatever part of my

route I may be.  In speaking _of characters_, I omitted _those of

Reyneval and Hennin_, the _two eyes_ of _Count de Vergennes_.  The

_former_ is the most important _character_, _because possessing_ the

most of the _confidence_ of the _Count_.  _He_ is rather _cunning_

than _wise_, his views of things being neither _great_ nor _liberal_.

_He governs_ himself by _principles_ which he has _learned_ by

_rote_, and is _fit only_ for the _details_ of _execution_.  _His

heart_ is susceptible of little _passions_ but not of _good ones_.

_He_ is _brother_-_in_-_law_ to _M_. _Gerard_, from whom he received

_disadvantageous impressions_ of _us_, _which_ cannot be _effaced_.

_He_ has much _duplicity_.  _Hennin_ is a _philosopher, sincere,

friendly, liberal, learned, beloved_ by everybody; the _other_ by

_nobody_.  I _think_ it a great _misfortune_ that the _United States_

are in the _department_ of the _former_.  As particulars of this kind

may be useful to you, in your present situation, I may hereafter

continue the chapter.  I know it will be safely lodged in your

discretion.




        Feb. 5.  Since writing thus far, _Franks_ is _returned_ from

_England_.  _I learn_ that _Mr_. _Adams_ desires to be _recalled_, &

that _Smith_ should be _appointed charge des affaires_ there.  It is

not for me to decide whether any _diplomatic character_ should be

_kept_ at a _court_, which _keeps_ none with _us_.  You can judge of

_Smith's_ abilities by _his letters_.  They are not of the _first

order_, but they are _good_.  For his _honesty_, he is like our

friend _Monroe_; turn his _soul_ wrong side outwards, and there is

not a speck on it.  _He_ has one _foible_, an _excessive

inflammability_ of _temper_, but he feels it when it comes on, and

has _resolution enough_ to _suppress_ it, and to _remain silent_ till

it _passes_ over.




        I send you by Colo. Franks, your pocket telescope, walking

stick & chemical box.  The two former could not be combined together.

The latter could not be had in the form you referred to.  Having a

great desire to have a portable copying machine, & being satisfied

from some experiments that the principle of the large machine might

be applied in a small one, I planned one when in England & had it

made.  It answers perfectly.  I have since set a workman to making

them here, & they are in such demand that he has his hands full.

Being assured that you will be pleased to have one, when you shall

have tried it's convenience, I send you one by Colo.  Franks.  The

machine costs 96 livres, the appendages 24 livres, and I send you

paper & ink for 12 livres; in all 132 livres.  There is a printed

paper of directions; but you must expect to make many essays before

you succeed perfectly.  A soft brush, like a shaving brush, is more

convenient than the sponge.  You can get as much ink & paper as you

please from London.  The paper costs a guinea a ream.







        "THE EMPTY BUSTLE OF PARIS"




        _To Anne Willing Bingham_

        _Paris, February 7, 1787_




        I know, Madam, that the twelve month is not yet expired; but it

will be, nearly, before this will have the honor of being put into

your hands.  You are then engaged to tell me, truly and honestly,

whether you do not find the tranquil pleasures of America, preferable

to the empty bustle of Paris.  For to what does that bustle tend?  At

eleven o'clock, it is day, _chez madame_.  The curtains are drawn.

Propped on bolsters and pillows, and her head scratched into a little

order, the bulletins of the sick are read, and the billets of the

well.  She writes to some of her acquaintance, and receives the

visits of others.  If the morning is not very thronged, she is able

to get out and hobble round the cage of the Palais royal; but she

must hobble quickly, for the _coeffeur's_ turn is come; and a

tremendous turn it is!  Happy, if he does not make her arrive when

dinner is half over!  The torpitude of digestion a little passed, she

flutters half an hour through the streets, by way of paying visits,

and then to the spectacles.  These finished, another half hour is

devoted to dodging in and out of the doors of her very sincere

friends, and away to supper.  After supper, cards; and after cards,

bed; to rise at noon the next day, and to tread, like a mill horse,

the same trodden circle over again.  Thus the days of life are

consumed, one by one, without an object beyond the present moment;

ever flying from the ennui of that, yet carrying it with us;

eternally in pursuit of happiness, which keeps eternally before us.

If death or bankruptcy happen to trip us out of the circle, it is

matter for the buz of the evening, and is completely forgotten by the

next morning.  In America, on the other hand, the society of your

husband, the fond cares for the children, the arrangements of the

house, the improvements of the grounds, fill every moment with a

healthy and an useful activity.  Every exertion is encouraging,

because to present amusement, it joins the promise of some future

good.  The intervals of leisure are filled by the society of real

friends, whose affections are not thinned to cob-web, by being spread

over a thousand objects.  This is the picture, in the light it is

presented to my mind; now let me have it in yours.  If we do not

concur this year, we shall the next; or if not then, in a year or two

more.  You see I am determined not to suppose myself mistaken.




        To let you see that Paris is not changed in its pursuits, since

it was honored with your presence, I send you its monthly history.

But this relating only to the embellishments of their persons, I must

add, that those of the city go on well also.  A new bridge, for

example, is begun at the Place Louis Quinze; the old ones are

clearing of the rubbish which encumbered them in the form of houses;

new hospitals erecting; magnificent walls of inclosure, and Custom

houses at their entrances, &c. &c. &c.  I know of no interesting

change among those whom you honored with your acquaintance, unless

Monsieur de Saint James was of that number.  His bankruptcy, and

taking asylum in the Bastile, have furnished matter of aston-ishment.

His garden, at the Pont de Neuilly, where, on seventeen acres of

ground he had laid out fifty thousand louis, will probably sell for

somewhat less money.  The workmen of Paris are making rapid strides

towards English perfection.  Would you believe, that in the course of

the last two years, they have learned even to surpass their London

rivals in some articles?  Commission me to have you a phaeton made,

and if it is not as much handsomer than a London one, as that is than

a Fiacre, send it back to me.  Shall I fill the box with caps,

bonnets, &c.?  Not of my own choosing, but -- I was going to say, of

Mademoiselle Bertin's, forgetting for the moment, that she too is

bankrupt.  They shall be chosen then by whom you please; or, if you

are altogether nonplused by her eclipse, we will call an Assemblee

des Notables, to help you out of the difficulty, as is now the

fashion.  In short, honor me with your commands of any kind, and they

shall be faithfully executed.  The packets now established from Havre

to New York, furnish good opportunities of sending whatever you wish.







        I shall end where I began, like a Paris day, reminding you of

your engagement to write me a letter of respectable length, an

engagement the more precious to me, as it has furnished me the

occasion, after presenting my respects to Mr. Bingham, of assuring

you of the sincerity of those senti-ments of esteem and respect, with

which I have the honor to be, Dear Madam, your most obedient and most

humble servant,







        "A LITTLE REBELLION NOW AND THEN"




        _To Abigail Adams_

        _Paris, Feb. 22, 1787_




        DEAR MADAM -- I am to acknolege the honor of your letter of

Jan. 29. and of the papers you were so good as to send me.  They were

the latest I had seen or have yet seen.  They left off too in a

critical moment; just at the point where the Malcontents make their

submission on condition of pardon, and before the answer of

government was known.  I hope they pardoned them.  The spirit of

resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, that I

wish it to be always kept alive.  It will often be exercised when

wrong, but better so than not to be exercised at all.  I like a

little rebellion now and then.  It is like a storm in the Atmosphere.

It is wonderful that no letter or paper tells us who is president of

Congress, tho' there are letters in Paris to the beginning of

January.  I suppose I shall hear when I come back from my journey,

which will be eight months after he will have been chosen.  And yet

they complain of us for not giving them intelligence.  Our Notables

assembled to-day, and I hope before the departure of Mr. Cairnes I

shall have heard something of their proceedings worth communicating

to Mr. Adams.  The most remarkeable effect of this convention as yet

is the number of puns and bon mots it has generated.  I think were

they all collected it would make a more voluminous work than the

Encyclopedie.  This occasion, more than any thing I have seen,

convinces me that this nation is incapable of any serious effort but

under the word of command.  The people at large view every object

only as it may furnish puns and bon mots; and I pronounce that a good

punster would disarm the whole nation were they ever so seriously

disposed to revolt.  Indeed, Madam, they are gone.  When a measure so

capable of doing good as the calling the Notables is treated with so

much ridicule, we may conclude the nation desperate, and in charity

pray that heaven may send them good kings.  -- The bridge at the

place Louis XV. is begun.  The hotel dieu is to be abandoned and new

ones to be built.  The old houses on the old bridges are in a course

of demolition.  This is all I know of Paris.  We are about to lose

the Count d'Aranda, who has desired and obtained his recall.  Fernand

Nunnez, before destined for London is to come here.  The Abbes Arnoux

and Chalut are well.  The Dutchess Danville somewhat recovered from

the loss of her daughter.  Mrs. Barrett very homesick, and fancying

herself otherwise sick.  They will probably remove to Honfleur.  This

is all our news.  I have only to add then that Mr. Cairnes has taken

charge of 15. aunes of black lace for you at 9 livres the aune,

purchased by Petit and therefore I hope better purchased than some

things have been for you; and that I am with sincere esteem Dear

Madam your affectionate humble servt.,







        THE MAISON CARREE




        _To Madame de Tesse_

        _Nismes, March 20, 1787_




        Here I am, Madam, gazing whole hours at the Maison quarree,

like a lover at his mistress.  The stocking weavers and silk spinners

around it, consider me as a hypochondriac Englishman, about to write

with a pistol, the last chapter of his history.  This is the second

time I have been in love since I left Paris.  The first was with a

Diana at the Chateau de Laye-Epinaye in Beaujolois, a delicious

morsel of sculpture, by M. A. Slodtz.  This, you will say, was a

rule, to fall in love with a female beauty: but with a house!  It is

out of all precedent.  No, Madam, it is not without a precedent, in

my own history.  While in Paris, I was violently smitten with the

Hotel de Salm, and used to go to the Thuileries almost daily, to look

at it.  The _loueuse des chaises_, inattentive to my passion, never

had the complaisance to place a chair there, so that sitting on the

parapet, and twisting my neck round to see the object of my

admiration, I generally left it with a _torti_-_colli_.




        From Lyons to Nismes I have been nourished with the remains of

Roman grandeur.  They have always brought you to my mind, because I

know your affection for whatever is Roman and noble.  At Vienne I

thought of you.  But I am glad you were not there; for you would have

seen me more angry than, I hope, you will ever see me.  The

Praetorian palace, as it is called, comparable, for its fine

proportions, to the Maison quarree, defaced by the barbarians who

have converted it to its present purpose, its beautiful fluted

Corinthian columns cut out, in part, to make space for Gothic

windows, and hewed down, in the residue, to the plane of the

building, was enough, you must admit, to disturb my composure.  At

Orange too, I thought of you.  I was sure you had seen with pleasure,

the sublime triumphal arch of Marius at the entrance of the city.  I

went then to the Arenae.  Would you believe, Madam, that in this

eighteenth century, in France, under the reign of Louis XVI. they are

at this momont pulling down the circular wall of this superb remain,

to pave a road?  And that too from a hill which is itself an entire

mass of stone, just as fit, and more accessible?  A former intendant,

a M. de Basville has rendered his memory dear to the traveller and

amateur, by the pains he took to preserve and restore these monuments

of antiquity.  The present one (I do not know who he is) is

demolishing the object, to make a good road to it.  I thought of you

again, and I was then in great good humor, at the Pont du Gard, a

sublime antiquity, and well preserved.  But most of all here, where

Roman taste, genius and magnificence, excite ideas analogous to yours

at every step.  I could no longer oppose the inclination to avail

myself of your permission to write to you, a permission given with

too much complaisance by you, and used by me, with too much

indiscretion.  Madame de Tott did me the same honor.  But she, being

only the descendant of some of those puny heroes who boiled their own

kettles before the walls of Troy, I shall write to her from a

Grecian, rather than a Roman canton: when I shall find myself, for

example among her Phocaean relations at Marseilles.




        Loving, as you do madam, the precious remains of antiquity,

loving architecture, gardening, a warm sun and a clear sky, I wonder

you have never thought of moving Chaville to Nismes.  This, as you

know, has not always been deemed impracticable; and therefore, the

next time a _Sur-intendant des batiments du roi_, after the example

of M. Colbert, sends persons to Nismes to move the Maison quarree to

Paris, that they may not come empty handed, desire them to bring

Chaville with them, to replace it.  A propos of Paris.  I have now

been three weeks from there, without knowing any thing of what has

passed.  I suppose I shall meet it all at Aix, where I have directed

my letters to be lodged, _poste restante_.  My journey has given me

leisure to reflect on this Assemblee des Notables.  Under a good and

a young King, as the present, I think good may be made of it.  I

would have the deputies then, by all means, so conduct themselves as

to encourage him to repeat the calls of this Assembly.  Their first

step should be, to get themselves divided into two chambers instead

of seven; the Noblesse and the Commons separately.  The second, to

persuade the King, instead of choosing the deputies of the Commons

himself, to summon those chosen by the people for the Provincial

administrations.  The third, as the Noblesse is too numerous to be

all of the Assemblee, to obtain permission for that body to choose

its own deputies.  Two Houses, so elected, would contain a mass of

wisdom which would make the people happy, and the King great; would

place him in history where no other act can possibly place him.  They

would thus put themselves in the track of the best guide they can

follow, they would soon overtake it, become its guide in turn, and

lead to the wholesome modifications wanting in that model, and

necessary to constitute a rational government.  Should they attempt

more than the established habits of the people are ripe for, they may

lose all, and retard indefinitely the ultimate object of their aim.

These, Madam, are my opinions; but I wish to know yours, which, I am

sure, will be better.




        From a correspondent at Nismes, you will not expect news.  Were

I to attempt to give you news, I should tell you stories one thousand

years old.  I should detail to you the intrigues of the courts of the

Caesars, how they affect us here, the oppressions of their praetors,

prefects, &c. I am immersed in antiquities from morning to night.

For me, the city of Rome is actually existing in all the splendor of

its empire.  I am filled with alarms for the event of the irruptions

daily making on us, by the Goths, the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and

Vandals, lest they should re-conquer us to our original barbarism.

If I am sometimes induced to look forward to the eighteenth century,

it is only when recalled to it by the recollection of your goodness

and friendship, and by those sentiments of sincere esteem and

respect, with which I have the honor to be, Madam, your most obedient

and most humble servant,
