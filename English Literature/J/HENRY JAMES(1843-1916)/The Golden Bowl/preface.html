<P><B>PREFACE</B>

<P>Among many matters thrown into relief by a refreshed acquaintance with
"The Golden Bowl" what perhaps most stands out for me is the still marked
inveteracy of a certain indirect and oblique view of my presented action;
unless indeed I make up my mind to call this mode of treatment, on the
contrary, any superficial appearance notwithstanding, the very straightest
and closest possible. I have already betrayed, as an accepted habit, and
even to extravagance commented on, my preference for dealing with my subject
matter, for "seeing my story," through the opportunity and the sensibility
of some more or less detached, some not strictly involved, though thoroughly
interested and intelligent, witness or reporter, some person who contributes
to the case mainly a certain amount of criticism and interpretation of
it. Again and again, on review, the shorter things in especial that I have
gathered into this Series have ranged themselves not as my own impersonal
account of the affair in hand, but as my account of somebody's impression
of it--the terms of this person's access to it and estimate of it contributing
thus by some fine little law to intensification of interest. The somebody
is often, among my shorter tales I recognise, but an unnamed, unintroduced
and (save by right of intrinsic wit) unwarranted participant, the impersonal
author's concrete deputy or delegate, a convenient substitute or apologist
for the creative power otherwise so veiled and disembodied. My instinct
appears repeatedly to have been that to arrive at the facts retailed and
the figures introduced by the given help of some other conscious and confessed
agent is essentially to find the whole business--that is, as I say, its
effective interest--enriched BY THE WAY. I have in other words constantly
inclined to the idea of the (vi) particular attaching case PLUS some near
individual view of it; that nearness quite having thus to become an imagined
observer's, a projected, charmed painter's or poet's--however avowed the
"minor" quality in the latter--close and sensitive contact with it. Anything,
in short, I now reflect, must always have seemed to me better--better for
the process and the effect of representation, my irrepressible ideal--than
the mere muffled majesty of irresponsible "authorship." Beset constantly
with the sense that the painter of the picture or the chanter of the ballad
(whatever we may call him) can never be responsible ENOUGH, and for every
inch of his surface and note of his song, I track my uncontrollable footsteps,
right and left, after the fact, while they take their quick turn, even
on stealthiest tiptoe, toward the point of view that, within the compass,
will give me most instead of least so answer for.

<P>I am aware of having glanced a good deal already in the direction of
this embarrassed truth--which I give for what it is worth; but I feel it
come home to me afresh on recognising that the manner in which it betrays
itself may be one of the liveliest sources of amusement in "The Golden
Bowl." It's not that the muffled majesty of authorship does n't here OSTENSIBLY
reign; but I catch myself again shaking it off and disavowing the pretence
of it while I get down into the arena and do my best to live and breathe
and rub shoulders and converse with the persons engaged in the struggle
that provides for the others in the circling tiers the entertainment of
the great game. There is no other participant, of course, than each of
the real, the deeply involved and immersed and more or less bleeding participants;
but I nevertheless affect myself as having held my system fast and fondly,
with one hand at least, by the manner in which the whole thing remains
subject to the register, ever so closely kept, of the consciousness of
but two of the characters The Prince, in the first half of the book, virtually
sees and knows and makes out, virtually represents to himself everything
that concerns us--very nearly (though he does n't speak in the first person)
after the fashion of other reporters (vii) and critics of other situations.
Having a consciousness highly susceptible of registration, he thus makes
us see the things that may most interest us reflected in it as in the clean
glass held up to so many of the "short stories" of our long list- and yet
after all never a whit to the prejudice of his being just as consistently
a foredoomed, entangled, embarrassed agent in the general imbroglio, actor
in the offered play. The function of the Princess, in the remainder, matches
exactly with his; the register of HER consciousness is as closely kept--as
closely, say, not only as his own, but as that (to cite examples) either
of the intelligent but quite unindividualised witness of the destruction
of "The Aspern Papers," or of the all-noting heroine of "The Spoils of
Poynton," highly individualised THOUGH highly intelligent; the Princess,
in fine, in addition to feeling everything she has to, and to playing her
part just in that proportion, duplicates, as it were, her value and becomes
a compositional resource, and of the finest order, as well as a value intrinsic.
So it is that the admirably-endowed pair, between them, as I retrace their
fortune and my own method, point again for me the moral of the endless
interest, endless worth for "delight," of the compositional contribution.
Their chronicle strikes me as quite of the stuff to keep us from forgetting
that absolutely NO refinement of ingenuity or of precaution need be dreamed
of as wasted in that most exquisite of all good causes the appeal to variety,
the appeal to incalculability, the appeal to a high refinement and a handsome
wholeness of effect.

<P>There are other things I might remark here, despite its perhaps seeming
a general connexion that I have elsewhere sufficiently shown as suggestive;
but I have other matter in hand and I take a moment only to meet a possible
objection--should any reader be so far solicitous or even attentive--to
what I have just said. It may be noted, that is, that the Prince, in the
volume over which he nominally presides, is represented as in comprehensive
cognition only of those aspects as to which Mrs. Assingham does n't functionally--perhaps
all too officiously, as the reader may (viii) sometimes feel it--supersede
him. This disparity in my plan is, however, but superficial; the thing
abides rigidly by its law of showing Maggie Verver at first through her
suitor's and her husband's exhibitory vision of her, and of then showing
the Prince, with at least an equal intensity, through his wife's; the advantage
thus being that these attributions of experience display the sentient subjects
themselves at the same time and by the same stroke with the nearest possible
approach to a desirable vividness. It is the Prince who opens the door
to half our light upon Maggie, just as it is she who opens it to half our
light upon himself; the rest of our impression, in either case, coming
straight from the very motion with which that act is performed. We see
Charlotte also at first, and we see Adam Verver, let alone our seeing Mrs.
Assingham, and every one and every thing else, but as they are visible
in the Prince's interest, so to speak--by which I mean of course in the
interest of his being himself handed over to us. With a like consistency
we see the same persons and things again but as Maggie's interest, HER
exhibitional charm, determines the view. In making which remark, with its
apparently so limited enumeration of my elements, I naturally am brought
up against the fact of the fundamental fewness of these latter--of the
fact that my large demand is made for a group of agents who may be counted
on the fingers of one hand. We see very few persons in "The Golden Bowl,"
but the scheme of the book, to make up for that, is that we shall really
see about as much of them as a coherent literary form permits. That was
my problem, so to speak, and my gageure--to play the small handful of values
really for all they were worth--and to work my system, my particular propriety
of appeal, particular degree of pressure on the spring of Interest, for
all that this specific ingenuity itself might be. To have a scheme and
a view of its dignity is of course congruously to work it out, and the
"amusement" of the chronicle in question--by which, once more, I always
mean the gathered cluster of all the KINDS of interest--was exactly to
see what a consummate application of such sincerities would give.

<P>(ix) So much for some only of the suggestions of re-perusal here--since,
all the while, I feel myself awaited by a pair of appeals really more pressing
than either of those just met; a minor and a major appeal, as I may call
them: the former of which I take first. I have so thoroughly "gone into"
things, in an expository way, on the ground covered by this collection
of my writings, that I should still judge it superficial to have spoken
no word for so salient a feature of our Edition as the couple of dozen
decorative "illustrations." This series of frontispieces contribute less
to ornament, I recognise, than if Mr. Alvin Langdon Coburn's beautiful
photographs, which they reproduce, had had to suffer less reduction; but
of those that have suffered least the beauty, to my sense, remains great,
and I indulge at any rate in this glance at our general intention for the
sake of the small page of history thereby added to my already voluminous,
yet on the whole so unabashed, memoranda. I should in fact be tempted here,
but for lack of space, by the very question itself at large--that question
of the general acceptability of illustration coming up sooner or later,
in these days, for the author of any text putting forward illustrative
claims (that is producing an effect of illustration) by its own intrinsic
virtue and so finding itself elbowed, on that ground, by another and a
competitive process. The essence of any representational work is of course
to bristle with immediate images; and I, for one, should have looked much
askance at the proposal, on the part of my associates in the whole business,
to graft or "grow," at whatever point, a picture by another hand on my
own picture--this being always, to my sense, a lawless incident. Which
remark reflects heavily, of course, on the "picture-book" quality that
contemporary English and American prose appears more and more destined,
by the conditions of publication, to consent, however grudgingly, to see
imputed to it. But a moment's thought points the moral of the danger.

<P>Anything that relieves responsible prose of the duty of being, while
placed before us, good enough, interesting enough and, if the question
be of picture, pictorial enough, above all (x) IN ITSELF, does it the worst
of services, and may well inspire in the lover of literature certain lively
questions as to the future of that institution. That one should, as an
author, reduce one's reader, "artistically" inclined, to such a state of
hallucination by the images one has evoked as does n't permit him to rest
till he has noted or recorded them, set up some semblance of them in his
own other medium, by his own other art--nothing could better consort than
THAT, I naturally allow, with the desire or the pretension to cast a literary
spell. Charming, that is, for the projector and creator of figures and
scenes that are as nought from the moment they fail to become more or less
visible appearances, charming for this manipulator of aspects to see such
power as he may possess approved and registered by the springing of such
fruit from his seed. His own garden, however, remains one thing, and the
garden he has prompted the cultivation of at other hands becomes quite
another; which means that the frame of one's own work no more provides
place for such a plot than we expect flesh and fish to be served on the
same platter. One welcomes illustration, in other words, with pride and
joy; but also with the emphatic view that, might one's "literary jealousy"
be duly deferred to, it would quite stand off and on its own feet and thus,
as a separate and independent subject of publication, carrying its text
in its spirit, just as that text correspondingly carries the plastic possibility,
become a still more glorious tribute. So far my invidious distinction between
the writer's "frame" and the draughtsman's; and if in spite of it I could
still make place for the idea of a contribution of value by Mr. A. L. Coburn
to each of these volumes--and a contribution in as different a "medium"
as possible--this was just because the proposed photographic studies were
to seek the way, which they have happily found, I think, not to keep, or
to pretend to keep, anything like dramatic step with their suggestive matter.
This would quite have disqualified them, to my rigour; but they were stall
right," in the so analytic modern critical phrase, through their discreetly
disavowing emulation. Nothing in fact could more have amused the (xi) author
than the opportunity of a hunt for a series of reproducible subjects--such
moreover as might best consort with photography--the reference of which
to Novel or Tale should exactly be NOT competitive and obvious, should
on the contrary plead its case with some shyness, that of images always
confessing themselves mere optical symbols or echoes, expressions of no
particular thing in the text, but only of the type or idea of this or that
thing. They were to remain at the most small pictures of our "set" stage
with the actors left out; and what was above all interesting was that they
were first to be constituted.

<P>This involved an amusing search which I would fain more fully commemorate;
since it took, to a great degree, and rather unexpectedly and incalculably,
the vastly, though but incidentally, instructive form of an enquiry into
the street scenery of London; a field yielding a ripe harvest of treasure
from the moment I held up to it, in my fellow artist's company, the light
of our fond idea--the idea, that is, of the aspect of things or the combination
of objects that might, by a latent virtue in it, speak for its connexion
with something in the book, and yet at the same time speak enough for its
odd or interesting self. It will be noticed that our series of frontispieces,
while doing all justice to our need, largely consists in a "rendering"
of certain inanimate characteristics of London streets; the ability of
which to suffice to this furnishing forth of my Volumes ministered alike
to surprise and convenience. Even at the cost of inconsistency of attitude
in the matter of the "grafted" image, I should have been tempted, I confess,
by the mere pleasure of exploration, abounding as the business at once
began to do in those prizes of curiosity for which the London-lover is
at any time ready to "back" the prodigious city. It was n't always that
I straightway found, with my fellow searcher, what we were looking for,
but that the looking itself so often flooded with light the question of
what a "subject," what "character," what a saving sense in things, is and
is n't; and that when our quest was rewarded, it was, I make bold to say,
rewarded in perfection. On the question, (xii) for instance, of the proper
preliminary compliment to the first volume of "The Golden Bowl" we easily
felt that nothing would so serve as a view of the small shop in which the
Bowl is first encountered.

<P>The problem thus was thrilling, for though the small shop was but a
shop of the mind, of the author's projected world, in which objects are
primarily related to each other, and therefore not "taken from" a particular
establishment anywhere, only an image distilled and intensified, as it
were, from a drop of the essence of such establishments in general, our
need (since the picture was, as I have said, also completely to speak for
itself) prescribed a concrete, independent, vivid instance, the instance
that should oblige us by the marvel of an accidental rightness. It might
so easily be wrong--by the act of being at all. It would have to be in
the first place what London and chance and an extreme improbability should
have made it, and then it would have to let us truthfully read into it
the Prince's and Charlotte's and the Princess's visits. It of course on
these terms long evaded us, but all the while really without prejudice
to our fond confidence that, as London ends by giving one absolutely everything
one asks, so it awaited us somewhere. It awaited us in fact--but I check
myself; nothing, I find now, would induce me to say where. Just so, to
conclude, it was equally obvious that for the second volume of the same
fiction nothing would so nobly serve as some generalised vision of Portland
Place. Both our limit and the very extent of our occasion, however, lay
in the fact that, unlike wanton designers, we had, not to "create" but
simply to recognise--recognise, that is, with the last fineness. The thing
was to induce the vision of Portland Place TO generalise itself. This is
precisely, however, the fashion after which the prodigious city, as I have
called it, does on occasion meet halfway those forms of intelligence of
it that IT recognises. All of which meant that at a given moment the great
featureless Philistine vista would itself perform a miracle, would become
interesting, for a splendid atmospheric hour, as only London knows how;
and that our business (xiii) would be then to understand. But my record
of that lesson takes me too far.

<P>So much for some only of the suggestions of re-perusal, and some of
those of re-representation here, since, all the while, I feel myself awaited
by an occasion more urgent than any of these. To re-read in their order
my final things, all of comparatively recent date, has been to become aware
of my putting the process through, for the latter end of my series (as
well as, throughout, for most of its later constituents) quite in the same
terms as the apparent and actual, the contemporary terms; to become aware
in other words that the march of my present attention coincides sufficiently
with the march of my original expression; that my apprehension fits, more
concretely stated, without an effort or a struggle, certainly without bewilderment
or anguish, into the innumerable places prepared for it. As the historian
of the matter sees and speaks, so my intelligence of it, as a reader, meets
him halfway, passive, receptive, appreciative, often even grateful; unconscious,
quite blissfully, of any bar to intercourse, any disparity of sense between
us. Into his very footprints the responsive, the imaginative steps of the
docile reader that I consentingly become for him all comfortably sink;
his vision, superimposed on my own as an image in cut paper is applied
to a sharp shadow on a wall, matches, at every point, without excess or
deficiency. This truth throws into relief for me the very different dance
that the taking in hand of my earlier productions was to lead me; the quite
other kind of consciousness proceeding from THAT return. Nothing in my
whole renewal of attention to these things, to almost any instance of my
work previous to some dozen years ago, was more evident than that no such
active, appreciative process could take place on the mere palpable lines
of expression--thanks to the so frequent lapse of harmony between my present
mode of motion and that to which the existing footprints were due. It was,
all sensibly, as if the clear matter being still there, even as a shining
expanse of snow spread over a plain, my exploring tread, for application
to it, had quite unlearned the old pace and found (xiv) itself naturally
falling into another, which might sometimes indeed more or less agree with
the original tracks, but might most often, or very nearly, break the surface
in other places. What was thus predominantly interesting to note, at all
events, was the high spontaneity of these deviations and differences, which
became thus things not of choice, but of immediate and perfect necessity:
necessity to the end of dealing with the quantities in question at all.

<P>No march, accordingly, I was soon enough aware, could possibly be more
confident and free than this infinitely interesting and amusing ACT of
re-appropriation; shaking off all shackles of theory, unattended, as was
speedily to appear, with humiliating uncertainties, and almost as enlivening,
or at least as momentous, as, to a philosophic mind, a sudden large apprehension
of the Absolute. What indeed could be more delightful than to enjoy a sense
of the absolute in such easy conditions? The deviations and differences
might of course not have broken out at all, but from the moment they began
so naturally to multiply they became, as I say, my very terms of cognition.
The question of the "revision" of existing work had loomed large for me,
had seemed even at moments to bristle with difficulties; but that phase
of anxiety, I was rejoicingly to learn, belonged all but to the state of
postponed experience or to that of a prolonged and fatalistic indifference.
Since to get and to keep finished and dismissed work well behind one, and
to have as little to say to it and about it as possible, had been for years
one's only law, so, during that flat interregnum, involving, as who should
say, the very cultivation of unacquaintedness, creeping superstitions as
to what it might really have been had time to grow up and flourish. Not
least among these rioted doubtless the fond fear that any tidying-up of
the uncanny brood, any removal of accumulated dust, any washing of wizened
faces, or straightening of grizzled locks, or twitching, to a better effect,
of superannuated garments, might let one in, as the phrase is, for expensive
renovations. I make use here of the figure of age and infirmity, but in
point of fact I had rather viewed the reappearance of the first-born (xv)
of my progeny--a reappearance unimaginable save to some inheritance of
brighter and more congruous material form, of stored-up braveries of type
and margin and ample page, of general dignity and attitude, than had mostly
waited on their respective casual cradles--as a descent of awkward infants
from the nursery to the drawing-room under the kind appeal of enquiring,
of possibly interested, visitors. I had accordingly taken for granted the
common decencies of such a case--the responsible glance of some power above
from one nursling to another, the rapid flash of an anxious needle, the
not imperceptible effect of a certain audible splash of soap-and-water;
all in consideration of the searching radiance of drawing-room lamps as
compared with nursery candles. But it had been all the while present to
me that from the moment a stitch should be taken or a hair-brush applied
the PRINCIPLE of my making my brood more presentable under the nobler illumination
would be accepted and established, and it was there complications might
await me. I am afraid I had at stray moments wasted time in wondering what
discrimination against the freedom of the needle and the sponge would be
able to describe itself as not arbitrary. For it to confess to that taint
would be of course to write itself detestable.

<P>"Hands off altogether on the nurse's part!" was, as a merely barbarous
injunction, strictly conceivable; but only in the light of the truth that
it had never taken effect in any fair and stately, in any not vulgarly
irresponsible re-issue of anything. Therefore it was easy to see that any
such apologetic suppression as that of the "altogether," any such admission
as that of a single dab of the soap, left the door very much ajar. Any
request that an indulgent objector to drawing room discipline, to the purification,
in other words, of innocent childhood, should kindly measure out then the
appropriate amount of ablutional fluid for the whole case, would, on twenty
grounds, indubitably leave that invoked judge gaping. I had none the less,
I repeat, at muddled moments, seemed to see myself confusedly invoke him;
thanks to my but too naturally not being able to forecast the (xvi) perfect
grace with which an answer to all my questions was meanwhile awaiting me.
To expose the case frankly to a test--in other words to begin to re-read--was
at once to get nearer all its elements and so, as by the next felicity,
feel it purged of every doubt. It was the nervous postponement of that
respectful approach that I spoke of just now as, in the connexion, my waste
of time. This felt awkwardness sprang, as I was at a given moment to perceive,
from my too abject acceptance of the grand air with which the term Revision
had somehow, to my imagination, carried itself--and from my frivolous failure
to analyse the content of the word. To revise is to see, or to look over,
again--which means in the case of a written thing neither more nor less
than to re-read it. I had attached to it, in a brooding spirit, the idea
of re-writing--with which it was to have in the event, for my CONSCIOUS
play of mind, almost nothing in common. I had thought of re-writing as
so difficult, and even so absurd, as to be impossible--having also indeed,
for that matter, thought of re-reading in the same light. But the felicity
under the test was that where I had thus ruefully prefigured two efforts
there proved to be but one--and this an effort but at the first blush.
What rewriting might be was to remain--it has remained for me to this hour--a
mystery. On the other hand the act of revision, the act of seeing it again,
caused whatever I looked at on any page to flower before me as into the
only terms that honourably expressed it; and the "revised" element in the
present Edition is accordingly these terms, these rigid conditions of re-perusal,
registered; so many close notes, as who should say, on the particular vision
of the matter itself that experience had at last made the only possible
one.

<P>What it would be really interesting, and I dare say admirably difficult,
to go into would be the very history of this effect of experience; the
history, in other words, of the growth of the immense array of terms, perceptional
and expressional, that, after the fashion I have indicated, in sentence,
passage and page, simply looked over the heads of the standing terms--or
perhaps rather, like alert winged (xvii) creatures, perched on those diminished
summits and aspired to a clearer air. What it comes back to, for the maturer
mind--granting of course, to begin with, a mind accessible to questions
of such an order--is this attaching speculative interest of the matter,
or in vulgar parlance the inordinate intellectual "sport" of it: the how
and the whence and the why these intenser lights of experience come into
being and insist on shining. The interest of the question is attaching,
as I say, because really half the artist's life seems involved in it--or
doubtless, to speak more justly, the whole of his life intellectual. The
"old" matter is there, re-accepted, re-tasted, exquisitely re-assimilated
and re-enjoyed--believed in, to be brief, with the same "old" grateful
faith (since wherever the faith, in a particular case, has become aware
of a twinge of doubt I have simply concluded against the matter itself
and left it out); yet for due testimony, for re-assertion of value, perforating
as by some strange and fine, some latent and gathered force, a myriad more
adequate channels. It is over the fact of such a phenomenon and its so
possibly rich little history that I am moved just fondly to linger--and
for the reason I glanced at above, that to do so is in a manner to retrace
the whole growth of one's "taste," as our fathers used to say: a blessed
comprehensive name for many of the things deepest in us. The "taste" of
the poet is, at bottom and so far as the poet in him prevails over everything
else, his active sense of life: in accordance with which truth to keep
one's hand on it is to hold the silver clue to the whole labyrinth of his
consciousness. He feels this himself, good man--he recognises an attached
importance--whenever he feels that consciousness bristle with the notes,
as I have called them, of consenting re-perusal; as has again and again
publicly befallen him, to our no small edification, on occasions within
recent view. It has befallen him most frequently, I recognise, when the
supersessive terms of his expression have happened to be verse; but that
does n't in the least isolate his case, since it is clear to the most limited
intelligence that the title we give him is the only title of GENERAL application
and convenience for those who (xviii) passionately cultivate the image
of life and the art, on the whole so beneficial, of projecting it. The
seer and speaker under the descent of the god is the "poet," whatever his
form, and he ceases to be one only when his form, whatever else it may
nominally or superficially or vulgarly be, is unworthy of the god: in which
event, we promptly submit, he is n't worth talking of at all. He becomes
so worth it, and the god so adopts him, and so confirms his charming office
and name, in the degree in which his impulse and passion are general and
comprehensive--a definitional provision for them that makes but a mouthful
of so minor a distinction, in the fields of light, as that between verse
and prose.

<P>The circumstance that the poets then, and the more charming ones, HAVE
in a number of instances, with existing matter in hand, "registered" their
renewals of vision, attests quite enough the attraction deeply working
whenever the mind is, as I have said, accessible--accessible, that is,
to the finer appeal of accumulated "good stuff" and to the interest of
taking it in hand at all. For myself, I am prompted to note, the "taking"
has been to my consciousness, through the whole procession of this re-issue,
the least part of the affair: under the first touch of the spring my hands
were to feel themselves full; so much more did it become a question, on
the part of the accumulated good stuff, of seeming insistently to give
and give. I have alluded indeed to certain lapses of that munificence--or
at least to certain connexions in which I found myself declining to receive
again on ANY terms; but for the rest the sense of receiving has borne me
company without a break; a luxury making for its sole condition that I
should intelligently attend. The blest good stuff, sitting up, in its myriad
forms, so touchingly responsive to new care of any sort whatever, seemed
to pass with me a delightful bargain, and in the fewest possible words.
"Actively believe in us and then you'll see!"--it was n't more complicated
than that, and yet was to become as thrilling as if conditioned on depth
within depth. I saw therefore what I saw, and what these numerous pages
record, (xix) I trust, with clearness; though one element of fascination
tended all the while to rule the business--a fascination, at each stage
of my journey, on the noted score of that so shifting and uneven character
of the tracks of my original passage. This by itself introduced the charm
of suspense: what would the operative terms, in the given case, prove,
under criticism, to have been--a series of waiting satisfactions or an
array of waiting misfits? The misfits had but to be positive and concordant,
in the special intenser light, to represent together (as the two sides
of a coin show different legends) just so many effective felicities and
substitutes. But I could n't at all, in general, forecast these chances
and changes and proportions; they could but show for what they were as
I went; criticism after the fact was to find in them arrests and surprises,
emotions alike of disappointment and of elation: all of which means, obviously,
that the whole thing was a LIVING affair.

<P>The rate at which new readings, new conductors of sense interposed,
to make any total sense at all right, became, to this wonderful tune, the
very record and mirror of the general adventure of one's intelligence;
so that one at all times quite marvelled at the fair reach, the very length
of arm, of such a developed difference of measure as to what might and
what might n't constitute, all round, a due decency of "rendering." What
I have been most aware of asking myself, however, is how writers, on such
occasions of "revision," arrive at that successful resistance to the confident
assault of the new reading which appears in the great majority of examples
to have marked their course. The term that superlatively, that finally
"renders," is a flower that blooms by a beautiful law of its own (the fiftieth
part of a second often so sufficing it) in the very heart of the gathered
sheaf; it is THERE already, at any moment, almost before one can either
miss or suspect it--so that in short we shall never guess, I think, the
working secret of the revisionist for whom its colour and scent stir the
air but as immediately to be assimilated. Failing our divination, too,
we shall apparently not otherwise learn, for the simple reason that no
revisionist I (xx) can recall has ever been communicative. "People don't
do such things," we remember to have heard it, in this connexion, declared;
in other words they don't really re-read--no, not REALLY; at least they
do so to the effect either of seeing the buried, the latent life of a past
composition vibrate, at renewal of touch, into no activity and break through
its settled and "sunk" surface at no point whatever--on which conclusion,
I hasten to add, the situation remains simple and their responsibility
may lie down beside their work even as the lion beside the lamb; or else
they have in advance and on system stopped their ears, their eyes and even
their very noses. This latter heroic policy I find myself glancing at,
however, to wonder in what particular cases--failing, as I say, all the
really confessed--it can have been applied. The actual non-revisionists
(on any terms) are of course numerous enough, and with plenty to say for
themselves; their faith, clearly, is great, their lot serene and their
peace, above all, equally protected and undisturbed. But the tantalising
image of the revisionist who is n't one, the partial, the piecemeal revisionist,
inconsequent and insincere, this obscure and decidedly louche personage
hovers before me mainly, I think, but to challenge my belief. Where have
we met him, when it comes to that, in the walks of interesting prose literature,
and why assume that we HAVE to believe in him before we are absolutely
forced?

<P>If I turn for relief and contrast to some image of his opposite I at
once encounter it, and with a completeness that leaves nothing to be desired,
on any "old" ground, in presence of any "old" life, in the vast example
of Balzac. He (and these things, as we know, grew behind him at an extraordinary
rate) re-assaulted by supersessive terms, re-penetrated by finer channels,
never had on the one hand seen or said all or had on the other ceased to
press forward. His case has equal mass and authority--and beneath its protecting
shade, at any rate, I move for the brief remainder of these remarks. We
owe to the never-extinct operation of his sensibility, we have but meanwhile
to recall, our greatest exhibition of felt finalities, our richest and
hugest inheritance (xxi) of imaginative prose. That by itself might intensify
for me the interest of this general question of the reviving and reacting
vision--did n't my very own lucky experience, all so publicly incurred,
give me, as my reader may easily make out, quite enough to think of. I
almost lose myself, it may perhaps seem to him, in that obscure quantity;
obscure doubtless because of its consisting of the manifold delicate things,
the shy and illusive, the inscrutable, the indefinable, that minister to
deep and quite confident processes of change. It is enough, in any event,
to be both beguiled and mystified by evolutions so near home, without sounding
strange and probably even more abysmal waters. Since, however, an agreeable
flurry and an imperfect presence of mind might, on the former ground, still
be such a source of refreshment, so the constant refrain humming through
the agitation, "If only one COULD re-write, if only one COULD do better
justice to the patches of crude surface, the poor morsels of consciously
decent matter that catch one's eye with their rueful reproach for old stupidities
of touch!"--so that yearning reflexion, I say, was to have its superlative
as well as its positive moments. It was to reach its maximum, no doubt,
over many of the sorry businesses of "The American," for instance, where,
given the elements and the essence, the long-stored grievance of the subject
bristling with a sense of over-prolonged exposure in a garment misfitted,
a garment cheaply embroidered and unworthy of it, thereby most proportionately
sounded their plaint. This sharpness of appeal, the claim for exemplary
damages, or at least for poetic justice, was reduced to nothing, on the
other hand, in presence of the altogether better literary manners of "The
Ambassadors" and "The Golden Bowl"--a list I might much extend by the mention
of several shorter pieces.

<P>Inevitably, in such a case as that of "The American," and scarce less
indeed in those of "The Portrait of a Lady" and "The Princess Casamassima,"
each of these efforts so redolent of good intentions baffled by a treacherous
vehicle, an expertness too retarded, I could but dream the whole thing
over as I went--as I read; and, bathing it, so to speak, (xxii) in that
medium, hope that, some still newer and shrewder critic's intelligence
subtly operating, I should n't have breathed upon the old catastrophes
and accidents, the old wounds and mutilations and disfigurements, wholly
in vain. The same is true of the possible effect of this process of re-dreaming
on many of these gathered compositions, shorter and longer; I have prayed
that the finer air of the better form may sufficiently seem to hang about
them and gild them over--at least for readers, however few, at all CURIOUS
of questions of air and form. Nothing even at this point, and in these
quite final remarks, I confess, could strike me as more pertinent than--with
a great wealth of margin--to attempt to scatter here a few gleams of the
light in which some of my visions have all sturdily and complacently repeated
and others have, according to their kind and law, all joyously and blushingly
renewed themselves. These have doubtless both been ways of remaining unshamed;
though, for myself, on the whole, as I seem to make out, the interest of
the watched renewal has been livelier than that of the accepted repetition.
What has the affair been at the worst, I am most moved to ask, but an earnest
invitation to the reader to dream again in my company and in the interest
of his own larger absorption of my sense? The prime consequence on one's
own part of re-perusal is a sense for ever so many more of the shining
silver fish afloat in the deep sea of one's endeavour than the net of widest
casting could pretend to gather in; an author's common courtesy dictating
thus the best general course for making that sense contagious--so beautifully
tangled a web, when not so glorious a crown, does he weave by having at
heart, and by cherishing there, the confidence he has invited or imagined.
There is then absolutely no release to his pledged honour on the question
of repaying that confidence.

<P>The ideally handsome way is for him to multiply in any given connexion
all the possible sources of entertainment--or, more grossly expressing
it again, to intensify his whole chance of pleasure. (It all comes back
to that, to my and your "fun"--if we but allow the term its full extension;
to the production of which no humblest question involved, (xxiii) even
to that of the shade of a cadence or the position of a comma, is not richly
pertinent.) We have but to think a moment of such a matter as the play
of REPRESENTATIONAL values, those that make it a part, and an important
part, of our taking offered things in that we should take them as aspects
and visibilities--take them to the utmost as appearances, images, figures,
objects, so many important, so many contributive items of the furniture
of the world--in order to feel immediately the effect of such a condition
at every turn of our adventure and every point of the representative surface.
One has but to open the door to any forces of exhibition at all worthy
of the name in order to see the imaging and qualifying agency called at
once into play and put on its mettle. We may traverse acres of pretended
exhibitory prose from which the touch that directly evokes and finely presents,
the touch that operates for closeness and for charm, for conviction and
illusion, for communication, in a word, is unsurpassably absent. All of
which but means of course that the reader is, in the common phrase, "sold"--even
when, poor passive spirit, systematically bewildered and bamboozled on
the article of his dues, he may be but dimly aware of it. He has by the
same token and for the most part, I fear, a scarce quicker sensibility
on other heads, least of all perhaps on such a matter as his really quite
swindled state when the pledge given for his true beguilement fails to
ensure him that fullest experience of his pleasure which waits but on a
direct reading OUT of the addressed appeal. It is scarce necessary to note
that the highest test of any literary form conceived in the light of "poetry"--to
apply that term in its largest literary sense--hangs back unpardonably
from its office when it fails to lend itself to viva-voce treatment. We
talk here, naturally, not of non-poetic forms, but of those whose highest
bid is addressed to the imagination, to the spiritual and the aesthetic
vision, the mind led captive by a charm and a spell, an incalculable art.
The essential property of such a form as that is to give out its finest
and most numerous secrets, and to give them out most gratefully, under
the closest pressure--which is of course the pressure (xxiv) of the attention
articulately SOUNDED. Let it reward as much as it will and can the soundless,
the "quiet" reading, it still deplorably "muffs" its chance and its success,
still trifles with the roused appetite to which it can never honestly be
indifferent, by not having so arranged itself as to owe the flower of its
effect to the act and process of apprehension that so beautifully asks
most from it. It then infallibly, and not less beautifully, most responds;
for I have nowhere found vindicated the queer thesis that the right values
of interesting prose depend all on withheld tests--that is on its being,
for very pity and shame, but skimmed and scanted, shuffled and mumbled.
Gustave Flaubert has somewhere in this connexion an excellent word--to
the effect that any imaged prose that fails to be richly rewarding in return
for a competent utterance ranks itself as wrong through not being "in the
conditions of life." The more we remain in THEM, all round, the more pleasure
we dispense; the moral of which is--and there would be fifty other pertinent
things to say about this--that I have found revision intensify at every
step my impulse intimately to answer, by my light, to those conditions.

<P>All of which amounts doubtless but to saying that as the whole conduct
of life consists of things done, which do other things in their turn, just
so our behaviour and its fruits are essentially one and continuous and
persistent and unquenchable, so the act has its way of abiding and showing
and testifying, and so, among our innumerable acts, are no arbitrary, no
senseless separations. The more we are capable of acting the less gropingly
we plead such differences; whereby, with any capability, we recognise betimes
that to "put" things is very exactly and responsibly and interminably to
do them. Our expression of them, and the terms on which we understand that,
belong as nearly to our conduct and our life as every other feature of
our freedom; these things yield in fact some of its most exquisite material
to the religion of doing. More than that, our literary deeds enjoy this
marked advantage over many of our acts, that, though they go forth into
the world and stray even in the desert, they don't to (xxv) the same extent
lose themselves; their attachment and reference to us, however strained,
need n't necessarily lapse--while of the tie that binds us to THEM we may
make almost anything we like. We are condemned, in other words, whether
we will or no, to abandon and outlive, to forget and disown and hand over
to desolation, many vital or social performances--if only because the traces,
records, connexions, the very memorials we would fain preserve, are practically
impossible to rescue for that purpose from the general mixture. We give
them up even when we would n't--it is not a question of choice. Not so
on the other hand our really "done" things of this superior and more appreciable
order--which leave us indeed all licence of disconnexion and disavowal,
but positively impose on us no such necessity. Our relation to them is
essentially traceable, and in that fact abides, we feel, the incomparable
luxury of the artist. It rests altogether with himself not to break with
his values, not to "give away" his importances. Not to BE disconnected,
for the tradition of behaviour, he has but to feel that he is not; by his
lightest touch the whole chain of relation and responsibility is reconstituted.
Thus if he is always doing he can scarce, by his own measure, ever have
done. All of which means for him conduct with a vengeance, since it is
conduct minutely and publicly attested. Our noted behaviour at large may
show for ragged, because it perpetually escapes our control; we have again
and again to consent to its appearing in undress--that is in no state to
brook criticism. But on all the ground to which the pretension of performance
by a series of exquisite laws may apply there reigns one sovereign truth--which
decrees that, as art is nothing if not exemplary, care nothing if not active,
finish nothing if not consistent, the proved error is the base apologetic
deed, the helpless regret is the barren commentary, and "connexions" are
employable for finer purposes than mere gaping contrition.
