<P>The man in the little shop in which, well after this, they lingered
longest, the small but interesting dealer in the Bloomsbury street who
was remarkable for an insistence not importunate, inasmuch as it was mainly
mute, but singularly, intensely coercive--this personage fixed on his visitors
an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other while they
considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hope to tempt them.
They had come to him last, for their time was nearly up; an hour of it
at least, from the moment of their getting into a hansom at the Marble
Arch, having yielded no better result than the amusement invoked from the
first. The amusement of course was to have consisted in seeking, but it
had also involved the idea of finding; which latter necessity would have
been obtrusive only if they had found too soon. The question at present
was if they WERE finding, and they put it to each other, in the Bloomsbury
shop, while they enjoyed the undiverted attention of the shopman. He was
clearly the master and devoted to his business--the essence of which, in
his conception, might precisely have been this particular secret that he
possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairly threw over
their relation a sort of solemnity. He had n't many things, none of the
redundancy of "rot" they had elsewhere seen, and our friends had, on entering,
even had the sense of a (105) muster so scant that, as high values obviously
would n't reign, the effect might be almost pitiful. Then their impression
had changed; for, though the show was of small pieces, several taken from
the little window and others extracted from a cupboard behind the counter--dusky,
in the rather low-browed place, despite its glass doors--each bid for their
attention spoke, however modestly, for itself, and the pitch of their entertainer
s pretensions was promptly enough given. His array was heterogeneous and
not at all imposing; still it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto
seen.

<P>Charlotte, after the incident, was to be full of impressions, of several
of which, later on, she gave her companion--always in the interest of their
amusement--the benefit; and one of the impressions had been that the man
himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at. The Prince was to
reply to this that he himself had n't looked at him; as, precisely, in
the general connexion, Charlotte had more than once, from other days, noted,
for his advantage, her consciousness of how, below a certain social plane,
he never SAW. One kind of shopman was just like another to him--which was
oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that where it did notice noticed
so much. He took throughout always the meaner sort for granted--the night
of their meanness, or whatever name one might give it for him, made all
his cats grey. He did n't, no doubt, want to hurt them, but he imaged them
no more than if his eyes acted only for the level of his own high head.
Her own vision acted for every relation--this he had seen for himself:
she (106) remarked beggars, she remembered servants, she recognised cabmen;
she had often distinguished beauty, when out with him, in dirty children;
she had admired "type" in faces at hucksters' stalls. Therefore she had
on this occasion found their antiquario interesting; partly because he
cared so for his things, and partly because he cared--well, so for THEM.
"He likes his things--he loves them," she was to say; "and it is n't only--it
is n't perhaps even at all--that he loves to sell them. I think he would
love to keep them if he could; and he prefers at any rate to sell them
to right people. We, clearly, were right people--he knows them when he
sees them; and that's why, as I say, you could make out, or at least I
could, that he cared for us. Did n't you see"--she was to ask it with an
insistence--"the way he looked at us and took us in? I doubt if either
of us have ever been so well looked at before. Yes, he'll remember us"--she
was to profess herself convinced of THAT almost to uneasiness. "But it
was after all"--this was perhaps reassuring--"because, given his taste,
since he HAS taste, he was pleased with us, he was struck--he had ideas
about us. Well, I should think people might; we're beautiful--are n't we?--and
he knows. Then also he has his way; for that way of saying nothing with
his lips when he's all the while pressing you so with his face, which shows
how he knows you feel it--that IS a regular way."

<P>Of decent old gold, old silver, old bronze, of old chased and jewelled
artistry, were the objects that, successively produced, had ended by numerously
dotting the counter where the shopman's slim light (107) fingers, with
neat nails, touched them at moments, briefly, nervously, tenderly, as those
of a chess-player rest, a few seconds, over the board, on a figure he thinks
he may move and then may not: small florid ancientries, ornaments, pendants,
lockets, brooches, buckles, pretexts for dim brilliants, bloodless rubies,
pearls either too large or too opaque for value; miniatures mounted with
diamonds that had ceased to dazzle; snuff-boxes presented to--or by--the
too questionable great; cups, trays, taper-stands, suggestive of pawn-tickets,
archaic and brown, that would themselves, if preserved, have been prized
curiosities. A few commemorative medals of neat outline but dull reference;
a classic monument or two, things of the first years of the century; things
consular, Napoleonic, temples, obelisks, arches, tinily re-embodied, completed
the discreet cluster; in which, however, even after tentative re-enforcement
from several quaint rings, intaglios, amethysts, carbuncles, each of which
had found a home in the ancient sallow satin of some weakly-snapping little
box, there was, in spite of the due proportion of faint poetry, no great
force of persuasion. They looked, the visitors, they touched, they vaguely
pretended to consider, but with scepticism, so far as courtesy permitted,
in the quality of their attention. It was impossible they should n't, after
a little, tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying to Maggie a token
from such a stock. It would be--that was the difficulty--pretentious without
being "good"; too usual, as a treasure, to have been an inspiration of
the giver, and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any
terms. They had been out more than (108) two hours and evidently had found
nothing. It forced from Charlotte a rueful admission.

<P>"It ought, really, if it should be a thing of this sort, to take its
little value from having belonged to one's self."

<P>"Ecco!" said the Prince--just triumphantly enough. "There you are."

<P>Behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall. Two or three
of these Charlotte had seen him open, so that her eyes found themselves
resting on those he had n't visited. But she granted the whole mistake.
"There's nothing here she could wear."

<P>It was only after a moment that her companion rejoined: "Is there anything--do
you think--that you could?"

<P>It made her just start. She did n't at all events look at the objects;
she but looked for an instant very directly at him. "No."

<P>"Ah!" the Prince quietly exclaimed.

<P>"Would it be," Charlotte asked, "your idea to offer me something?"

<P>"Well, why not--as a small ricordo?"

<P>"But a ricordo of what?"

<P>"Why of 'this'--as you yourself say. Of this little hunt."

<P>"Oh I say it--but has n't my whole point been that I don't ask you to.
Therefore," she demanded--but smiling at him now--"where's the logic?"

<P>"Oh the logic--!" he laughed.

<P>"But logic's everything. That at least is how I feel it. A ricordo from
you--from you to me--is a ricordo of nothing. It has no reference."

<P>(109) "Ah my dear!" he vaguely protested. Their entertainer meanwhile
stood there with his eyes on them, and the girl, though at this minute
more interested in her passage with her friend than in anything else, again
met his gaze. It was a comfort to her that their foreign tongue covered
what they said--and they might have appeared of course, as the Prince now
had one of the snuff-boxes in his hand, to be discussing a purchase.

<P>"You don't refer," she went on to her companion. "I refer."

<P>He had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into it hard.
"Do you mean by that then that you would be free--?"

<P>"'Free'--?"

<P>"To offer me something?"

<P>This gave her a longer pause, and when she spoke again she might have
seemed, oddly, to be addressing the dealer. "Would you allow me--?"

<P>"No," said the Prince into his little box.

<P>"You would n't accept it from me?"

<P>"No," he repeated in the same way.

<P>She exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh. "But you've
touched an idea that HAS been mine. It's what I've wanted." Then she added:
"It was what I hoped."

<P>He put down his box--this had drawn his eyes. He made nothing, clearly,
of the little man's attention. "It's what you brought me out for?"

<P>"Well, that's at any rate," she returned, "my own affair. But it won't
do?"

<P>"It won't do, cara mia."

<P>(110) "It's impossible?"

<P>"It's impossible." And he took up one of the brooches.

<P>She had another pause, while the shopman only waited. "If I were to
accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest,
what should I do with it?"

<P>He was perhaps at last a little irritated; he even--as if HE might understand--looked
vaguely across at their host. "Wear it, per Bacco!"

<P>"Where then, please? Under my clothes?"

<P>"Wherever you like. But it is n't then, if you will," he added, "worth
talking about."

<P>"It's only worth talking about, mio caro," she smiled, "from your having
begun it. My question is only reasonable--so that your idea may stand or
fall by your answer to it. If I should pin one of these things on for you
would it be, to your mind, that I might go home and show it to Maggie as
your present?"

<P>They had had between them often in talk the refrain, jocosely, descriptively
applied, of "old Roman." It had been, as a pleasantry, in the other time,
his explanation to her of everything; but nothing truly had even seemed
so old-Roman as the shrug in which he now indulged. "Why in the world not?"

<P>"Because--on our basis--it would be impossible to give her an account
of the pretext."

<P>"The pretext--?" He wondered.

<P>"The occasion. This ramble that we shall have had together and that
we're not to speak of."

<P>(111) "Oh yes," he said after a moment--"I remember we're not to speak
of it."

<P>"That of course you're pledged to. And the one thing, you see, goes
with the other. So you don't insist."

<P>He had again, at random, laid back his trinket; with which he quite
turned to her a little wearily at last--even a little impatiently. "I don't
insist."

<P>It disposed for the time of the question, but what was next apparent
was that it had seen them no further. The shopman, who hadn't stirred,
stood there in his patience--which, his mute intensity helping, had almost
the effect of an ironic comment. The Prince moved to the glass door and,
his back to the others, as with nothing more to contribute, looked--though
not less patiently--into the street. Then the shopman, for Charlotte, momentously
broke silence. "You've seen, disgraziatamente, signora principessa," he
sadly said, "too much"--and it made the Prince face about. For the effect
of the momentous came, if not from the sense, from the sound of his words;
which was that of the suddenest sharpest Italian. Charlotte exchanged with
her friend a glance that matched it, and just for the minute they were
held in check. But their glance had after all by that time said more than
one thing; had both exclaimed on the apprehension, by the wretch, of their
intimate conversation, let alone of her possible, her impossible, title,
and remarked, for mutual reassurance, that it did n't, all the same, matter.
The Prince remained by the door, but immediately addressing the speaker
from where he stood.

<P>(112) "You're Italian then, are you?"

<P>But the reply came in English. "Oh dear no."

<P>"You're English?"

<P>To which the answer was this time, with a smile, in briefest Italian.
"Che!" The dealer waived the question--he practically disposed of it by
turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he had n't yet resorted
and from which, after unlocking it, he extracted a square box, of some
twenty inches in height, covered with worn-looking leather. He placed the
box on the counter, pushed back a pair of small hooks, lifted the lid and
removed from its nest a drinking-vessel larger than a common cup, yet not
of exorbitant size, and formed, to appearance, either of old fine gold
or of some material once richly gilt. He handled it with tenderness, with
ceremony, making a place for it on a small satin mat. "My Golden Bowl,"
he observed--and it sounded on his lips as if it said everything. He left
the important object--for as "important" it did somehow present itself--to
produce its certain effect. Simple but singularly elegant, it stood on
a circular foot, a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base, and,
though not of signal depth, justified its title by the charm of its shape
as well as by the tone of its surface. It might have been a large goblet
diminished, to the enhancement of its happy curve, by half its original
height. As formed of solid gold it was impressive; it seemed indeed to
warn off the prudent admirer. Charlotte, with care, immediately took it
up, while the Prince, who had after a minute shifted his position again,
regarded it from a distance.

<P>(113) It was heavier than Charlotte had thought. "Gold, really gold?"
she asked of their companion.

<P>He waited. "Look a little, and perhaps you'll make out."

<P>She looked, holding it up in both her fine hands, turning it to the
light. "It may be cheap for what it is, but it will be dear, I'm afraid,
for me."

<P>"Well," said the man, "I can part with it for less than its value. I
got it, you see, for less."

<P>"For how much then?"

<P>Again he waited, always with his serene stare. "Do you like it then?"

<P>Charlotte turned to her friend. "Do YOU like it?"

<P>He came no nearer; he looked at their entertainer. "Cos'e?"

<P>"Well, signori miei, if you must know, it's just a perfect crystal."

<P>"Of course we must know, per Dio!" said the Prince. But he turned away
again--he went back to his glass door.

<P>Charlotte set down the bowl; she was evidently taken. "Do you mean it's
cut out of a single crystal?"

<P>"If it is n't I think I can promise you that you'll never find any joint
or any piecing."

<P>She wondered. "Even if I were to scrape off the gold?"

<P>He showed, though with due respect, that she amused him. "You could
n't scrape it off--it has been too well put on; put on I don't know when
and I don't know how. But by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful
old process."

<P>(114) Charlotte, frankly charmed with the cup, smiled back at him now.
"A lost art?"

<P>"Call it a lost art."

<P>"But of what time then is the whole thing?"

<P>"Well, say also of a lost time."

<P>The girl considered. "Then if it's so precious how comes it to be cheap?"

<P>The dealer once more hung fire, but by this time the Prince had lost
patience. "I'll wait for you out in the air," he said to his companion,
and though he spoke without irritation he pointed his remark by passing
immediately into the street, where during the next minutes the others saw
him, his back to the shop-window, philosophically enough hover and light
a fresh cigarette. Charlotte even took a little her time; she was aware
of his funny Italian taste for London street-life.

<P>Her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question. "Ah I've had it
a long time without selling it. I think I must have been keeping it, madam,
for you."

<P>"You've kept it for me because you've thought I might n't see what's
the matter with it?"

<P>He only continued to face her--he only continued to appear to follow
the play of her mind. "What IS the matter with it?"

<P>"Oh it's not for me to say; it's for you honestly to tell me. Of course
I know something must be."

<P>"But if it's something you can't find out is n't that as good as if
it were nothing?"

<P>"I probably SHOULD find out as soon as I had paid for it."

<P>(115) "Not," her host lucidly insisted, "if you had n't paid too much."

<P>"What do you call," she asked, "little enough?"

<P>"Well, what should you say to fifteen pounds?"

<P>"I should say," said Charlotte with the utmost promptitude, "that it's
altogether too much."

<P>The dealer shook his head slowly and sadly, but firmly. "It's my price,
madam--and if you admire the thing I think it really might be yours. It's
not too much. It's too little. It's almost nothing. I can't go lower."

<P>Charlotte, wondering but resisting, bent over the bowl again. "Then
it's impossible. It's more than I can afford."

<P>"Ah," the man returned, "one can sometimes afford for a present more
than one can afford for one's self."

<P>He said it so coaxingly that she found herself going on without, as
might be said, putting him in his place. "Oh of course it would be only
for a present--!"

<P>"Then it would be a lovely one."

<P>"Does one make a present," she asked, "of an object that contains to
one's knowledge a flaw?"

<P>"Well, if one knows of it one has only to mention it. The good faith,"
the man smiled, "is always there."

<P>"And leave the person to whom one gives the thing, you mean, to discover
it?"

<P>"He would n't discover it--if you're speaking of a gentleman."

<P>"I'm not speaking of any one in particular," Charlotte said.

<P>(116) "Well, whoever it might be. He might know--and he might try. But
he would n't find."

<P>She kept her eyes on him as if, though unsatisfied, mystified, she yet
had a fancy for the bowl. "Not even if the thing should come to pieces?"
And then as he was silent: "Not even if he should have to say to me 'The
Golden Bowl is broken'?"

<P>He was still silent; after which he had his strangest smile. "Ah if
any one should WANT to smash it--!"

<P>She laughed; she almost admired the little man's expression. "You mean
one could smash it with a hammer?"

<P>"Yes, if nothing else would do. Or perhaps even by dashing it with violence--say
upon a marble floor."

<P>"Oh marble floors--!" But she might have been thinking--for they were
a connexion, marble floors; a connexion with many things: with her old
Rome, and with HIS; with the palaces of his past and, a little, of hers;
with the possibilities of his future, with the sumptuosities of his marriage,
with the wealth of the Ververs. All the same, however, there were other
things; and they all together held for a moment her fancy. "Does crystal
then break--when it IS crystal? I thought its beauty was its hardness."

<P>Her friend, in his way, discriminated. "Its beauty is its BEING crystal.
But its hardness is certainly its safety. It does n't break," he went on,
"like vile glass. It splits--if there is a split."

<P>"Ah!"--Charlotte breathed with interest. "If (117) there IS a split."
And she looked down again at the bowl. "There IS a split, eh? Crystal does
split, eh?"

<P>"On lines and by laws of its own."

<P>"You mean if there's a weak place?"

<P>For all answer, after an hesitation, he took the bowl up again, holding
it aloft and tapping it with a key. It rang with the finest sweetest sound.
"Where's the weak place?"

<P>She then did the question justice. "Well, for me only the price. I'm
poor, you see--very poor. But I thank you and I'll think." The Prince,
on the other side of the shop-window, had finally faced about and, as to
see if she had n't done, was trying to reach with his eyes the comparatively
dim interior. "I like it," she said--"I want it. But I must decide what
I can do."

<P>The man, not ungraciously, resigned himself. "Well, I'll keep it for
you."

<P>The small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity--this she felt
even by the time the open air and the Bloomsbury aspects had again, in
their protest against the truth of her gathered impression, made her more
or less their own. Yet the oddity might have been registered as small as
compared to the other effect that, before they had gone much further, she
had to take account of with her companion. This latter was simply the effect
of their having, by some tacit logic, some queer inevitability, quite dropped
the idea of a continued pursuit. They did n't say so, but it was on the
line of giving up Maggie's present that they practically proceeded--the
line of giving it up without more reference to it. (118) The Prince's first
reference was in fact quite independently made. "I hope you satisfied yourself,
before you had done, of what was the matter with that bowl."

<P>"No indeed, I satisfied myself of nothing. Of nothing at least but that
the more I looked at it the more I liked it, and that if you were n't so
unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the
pleasure of accepting it."

<P>He looked graver for her at this than he had looked all the morning.
"Do you propose it seriously--without wishing to play me a trick?"

<P>She wondered. "What trick would it be?"

<P>He looked at her harder. "You mean you really don't know?"

<P>"But know what?"

<P>"Why what's the matter with it. You did n't see, all the while?"

<P>She only continued however to stare. "How could you see--out in the
street?"

<P>"I saw before I went out. It was because I saw that I did go out. I
did n't want to have another scene with you before that rascal, and I judged
you'd presently guess for yourself."

<P>"Is he a rascal?" Charlotte asked. "His price is so moderate." She waited
but a moment. "Five pounds. Really so little."

<P>He continued to look at her. "Five pounds?"

<P>"Five pounds."

<P>He might have been doubting her word, but he was only, it appeared,
gathering emphasis. "It would be dear--to make a gift of--at five shillings.
If it had (119) cost you even but fivepence I would n't take it from you."

<P>"Then," she asked, "what IS the matter?"

<P>"Why it has a crack."

<P>It sounded, on his lips, so sharp, it had such an authority, that she
almost started, while her colour rose at the word. It was as if he had
been right, though his assurance was wonderful. "You answer for it without
having looked?"

<P>"I did look. I saw the object itself. It told its story. No wonder it's
cheap."

<P>"But it's exquisite," Charlotte, as if with an interest in it now made
even tenderer and stranger, found herself moved to insist.

<P>"Of course it's exquisite. That's the danger."

<P>Then a light visibly came to her--a light in which her friend suddenly
and intensely showed. The reflexion of it, as she smiled at him, was in
her own face. "The danger--I see--is because you're superstitious."

<P>"Per Dio I'm superstitious! A crack's a crack--and an omen's an omen."

<P>"You'd be afraid--?"

<P>"Per Bacco!"

<P>"For your happiness?"

<P>"For my happiness."

<P>"For your safety?"

<P>"For my safety."

<P>She just paused. "For your marriage?"

<P>"For my marriage. For everything."

<P>She thought again. "Thank goodness then that if there BE a crack we
know it! But if we may perish by (120) cracks in things that we don't know--!"
And she smiled with the sadness of it. "We can never then give each other
anything."

<P>He considered, but he met it. "Ah but one does know. I do at least--and
by instinct. I don't fail. That will always protect me."

<P>It was droll, the way he said such things; yet she liked him really
the more for it. They fell in for her with a general, or rather with a
special, vision. But she spoke with a mild despair. "What then will protect
ME?"

<P>"Where I'm concerned I will. From me at least you've nothing to fear,"
he now quite amiably responded. "Anything you consent to accept from me--"
But he paused.

<P>"Well?"

<P>"Well, shall be perfect."

<P>"That's very fine," she presently answered. "It's vain, after all, for
you to talk of my accepting things when you'll accept nothing from me."

<P>Ah THERE better still he could meet her. "You attach an impossible condition.
That, I mean, of my keeping your gift so to myself."

<P>Well, she looked, before him there, at the condition--then abruptly,
with a gesture, she gave it up. She had a headshake of disenchantment--so
far as the idea had appealed to her. It all appeared too difficult. "Oh
my 'condition'--I don't hold to it. You may cry it on the housetops--anything
I ever do."

<P>"Ah well, then--!" This made, he laughed, all the difference.

<P>(121) But it was too late. "Oh I don't care now! I SHOULD have liked
the Bowl. But if that won't do there's nothing."

<P>He considered this; he took it in, looking graver again; but after a
moment he qualified. "Yet I shall want some day to give you something."

<P>She wondered at him. "What day?"

<P>"The day you marry. For you WILL marry. You MUST--seriously--marry."

<P>She took it from him, but it determined in her the only words she was
to have uttered, all the morning, that came out as if a spring had been
pressed. "To make you feel better?"

<P>"Well," he replied frankly, wonderfully--"it will. But here," he added,
"is your hansom."

<P>He had signalled--the cab was charging. She put out no hand for their
separation, but she prepared to get in. Before she did so, however, she
said what had been gathering while she waited. "Well, I would marry, I
think, to have something from you in all freedom.
