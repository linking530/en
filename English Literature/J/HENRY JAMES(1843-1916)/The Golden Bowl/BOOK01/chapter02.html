<P>"They're not good days, you know," he had said to Fanny Assingham after
declaring himself grateful for finding her, and then, with his cup of tea,
putting her in possession of the latest news--the documents signed an hour
ago, de part et d'autre, and the telegram from his backers, who had reached
Paris the morning before, and who, pausing there a little, poor dears,
seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark. "We're very simple folk,
mere country cousins compared with you," he had also observed, "and Paris,
for my sister and her husband, is the end of the world. London therefore
will be more or less another planet. It has always been, as with so many
of us, quite their Mecca, but this is their first real caravan; they've
mainly known 'old England' as a shop for articles in india-rubber and leather,
in which they've dressed themselves as much as possible. Which all means,
however, that you'll see them, all of them, wreathed in smiles. We must
be very easy with them. Maggie's too wonderful--her preparations are on
a scale! She insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle. The others will
come to me. I've been engaging their rooms at the hotel, and with all those
solemn signatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me."

<P>"Do you mean you're afraid?" his hostess had amusedly asked.

<P>"Terribly afraid. I've now but to wait to see the (26) monster come.
They're not good days; they're neither one thing nor the other. I've really
GOT nothing, yet I've everything to lose. One does n't know what still
may happen."

<P>The way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating; it
came out, for his fancy, from behind the white curtain. It was a sign,
that is, of her deep serenity, which worried instead of soothing him. And
to be soothed, after all, to be tided over, in his mystic impatience, to
be told what he could understand and believe--that was what he had come
for. "Marriage then," said Mrs. Assingham, "is what you call the monster?
I admit it's a fearful thing at the best; but, for heaven's sake, if that's
what you're thinking of, don't run away from it."

<P>"Ah to run away from it would be to run away from you," the Prince replied;
"and I've already told you often enough how I depend on you to see me through."
He so liked the way she took this, from the corner of her sofa, that he
gave his sincerity--for it WAS sincerity--fuller expression. "I'm starting
on the great voyage--across the unknown sea; my ship's all rigged and appointed,
the cargo's stowed away and the company complete. But what seems the matter
with me is that I can't sail alone; my ship must be one of a pair, must
have, in the waste of waters, a--what do you call it?--a consort. I don't
ask you to stay on board with me, but I must keep your sail in sight for
orientation. I don't in the least myself know, I assure you, the points
of the compass. But with a lead I can perfectly follow. You MUST be my
lead."

<P>(27) How can you be sure," she asked, "where I should take you?"

<P>"Why from your having brought me safely thus far. I should never have
got here without you. You've provided the ship itself, and if you've not
quite seen me aboard you've attended me ever so kindly to the dock. Your
own vessel is all conveniently in the next berth, and you can't desert
me now." She showed him again her amusement, which struck him even as excessive,
as if, to his surprise, he made her also a little nervous; she treated
him in fine as if he were not uttering truths but making pretty figures
for her diversion. "My vessel, dear Prince?" she smiled. "What vessel in
the world have I? This little house is all our ship, Bob's and mine--and
thankful we are now to have it. We've wandered far, living, as you may
say, from hand to mouth, without rest for the soles of our feet. But the
time has come for us at last to draw in."

<P>He made at this, the young man, an indignant protest. "You talk about
rest--it's too selfish!--when you're just launching me on adventures?"

<P>She shook her head with her kind lucidity. "Not adventures--heaven forbid!
You've had yours--as I've had mine; and my idea has been all along that
we should neither of us begin again. My own last, precisely, has been doing
for you all you so prettily mention. But it consists simply in having conducted
you to rest. You talk about ships, but they're not the comparison. Your
tossings are over--you're practically in port. The port," she concluded,
"of the Golden Isles."

<P>(28) He looked about, to put himself more in relation with the place;
then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words instead of certain
others. "Oh I know where I AM--! I do decline to be left, but what I came
for of course was to thank you. If to-day has seemed for the first time
the end of preliminaries, I feel how little there would have been any at
all without you. The first were wholly yours."

<P>"Well," said Mrs. Assingham, "they were remarkably easy. I've seen them,
I've HAD them," she smiled, "more difficult. Everything, you must feel,
went of itself. So, you must feel, everything still goes."

<P>The Prince quickly agreed. "Oh beautifully! But you had the conception."

<P>"Ah Prince, so had you!"

<P>He looked at her harder a moment. "You had it first. You had it most."

<P>She returned his look as if it had made her wonder. "I LIKED it, if
that's what you mean. But you liked it surely yourself. I protest that
I had easy work with; you. I had only at last--when I thought it was time--to
speak for you."

<P>"All that's quite true. But you're leaving me all the same, you're leaving
me--you're washing your hands of me," he went on. "However, that won't
be easy; I won't BE left." And he had turned his eyes: about again, taking
in the pretty room that she had just described as her final refuge, the
place of peace for a world-worn couple, to which she had lately retired
with "Bob." "I shall keep this spot in sight. Say what you will I shall
need you. I'm not, you (29) know," he declared, "going to give you up for
anybody."

<P>"If you're afraid--which of course you're not--are you trying to make
me the same?" she asked after a moment.

<P>He waited a minute too, then answered her with a question. "You say
you 'liked' it, your undertaking to make my engagement possible. It remains
beautiful for me that you did; it's charming and unforgetable. [sic] But
still more it's mysterious and wonderful. WHY, you dear delightful woman,
did you like it?"

<P>"I scarce know what to make," she said, "of such an enquiry. If you
have n't by this time found out yourself, what meaning can anything I say
have for you? Don't you really after all feel," she added while nothing
came from him--"aren't you conscious every minute of the perfection of
the creature of whom I've put you into possession?"

<P>"Every minute--gratefully conscious. But that's exactly the ground of
my question. It was n't only a matter of your handing ME over--it was a
matter of your handing her. It was a matter of HER fate still more than
of mine. You thought all the good of her that one woman can think of another,
and yet, by your account, you enjoyed assisting at her risk."

<P>She had kept her eyes on him while he spoke, and this was what visibly
determined a repetition for her. "Are you trying to frighten me?"

<P>"Ah that's a foolish view--I should be too vulgar. You apparently can't
understand either my good faith or my humility. I'm awfully humble," the
young man insisted; "that's the way I've been feeling to-day, (30) with
everything so finished and ready. And you won't take me for serious."

<P>She continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little. "Oh
you deep old Italians!"

<P>"There you are," he returned--"it's what I wanted you to come to. That's
the responsible note."

<P>"Yes," she went on--"if you're 'humble' you must be dangerous." She
had a pause while he only smiled; then she said: "I don't in the least
want to lose sight of you. But even if I did I should n't think it right."

<P>"Thank you for that--it's what I needed of you. I'm sure, after all,
that the more you're with me the more I shall understand. It's the only
thing in the world I want. I'm excellent, I really think, all round--except
that I'm stupid. I can do pretty well anything I see. But I've got to see
it first." And he pursued his demonstration. "I don't in the least mind
its having to be shown me--in fact I like that better. Therefore it is
that I want, that I shall always want, your eyes. Through them I wish to
look--even at any risk of their showing me what I may n't like. For then,"
he wound up, "I shall know. And of that I shall never be afraid."

<P>She might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to, but
she spoke with a certain impatience. "What on earth are you talking about?"

<P>But he could perfectly say: "Of my real honest fear of being 'off' some
day, of being wrong, WITHOUT knowing it. That's what I shall always trust
you for--to tell me when I am. No--with you people it's a sense. We have
n't got it--not as you have. Therefore--!" (31) But he had said enough.
"Ecco!" he simply smiled.

<P>It was not to be concealed that he worked upon her, but of course she
had always liked him. "I should be interested," she presently remarked,
"to see some sense you don't possess."

<P>Well, he produced one on the spot. "The moral, dear Mrs. Assingham.
I mean always as you others consider it. I've of course something that
in our poor dear backward old Rome sufficiently passes for it. But it's
no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircase--half-ruined into
the bargain!--in some castle of our quattrocento is like the 'lightning
elevator' in one of Mr. Verver's fifteen-storey buildings. Your moral sense
works by steam--it sends you up like a rocket. Ours is slow and steep and
unlighted, with so many of the steps missing that--well, that it's as short
in almost any case to turn round and come down again."

<P>"Trusting," Mrs. Assingham smiled, "to get up some other way?"

<P>"Yes--or not to have to get up at all. However," he added, "I told you
that at the beginning."

<P>"Machiavelli!" she simply exclaimed.

<P>"You do me too much honour. I wish indeed I had his genius. However,
if you really believed I have his perversity you would n't say it. But
it's all right," he gaily enough concluded; "I shall always have you to
come to."

<P>On this, for a little, they sat face to face; after which, without comment,
she asked him if he would have more tea. All she would give him, he promptly
(32) signified; and he developed, making her laugh, his idea that the tea
of the English race was somehow their morality, "made," with boiling water,
in a little pot, so that the more of it one drank the more moral one would
become. His drollery served as a transition, and she put to him several
questions about his sister and the others, questions as to what Bob, in
particular, Colonel Assingham, her husband, could do for the arriving gentlemen,
whom, by the Prince's leave, he would immediately go to see. He was funny,
while they talked, about his own people too, whom he described, with anecdotes
of their habits, imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct,
as more rococo than anything Cadogan Place would ever have known. This,
Mrs. Assingham professed, was exactly what would endear them to her, and
that in turn drew from her visitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort
of his being able so to depend on her. He had been with her at this point
some twenty minutes; but he had paid her much longer visits, and he stayed
now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation. He stayed moreover--THAT
was really the sign of the hour--in spite of the nervous unrest that had
brought him and that had in truth much rather fed on the scepticism by
which she had apparently meant to soothe it. She had n't soothed him, and
there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed
out. He had n't frightened her, as she called it--he felt that; yet she
was herself not at ease. She had been nervous, though trying to disguise
it; the sight of him, following on the announcement of his name, had shown
her as disconcerted. This conviction, for the (33) young man, deepened
and sharpened; yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it.
It was as if, in calling, he had done even better than he intended. For
it was somehow IMPORTANT--that was what it was--that there should be at
this hour something the matter with Mrs. Assingham, with whom, in all their
acquaintance, so considerable now, there had never been the least little
thing the matter. To wait thus and watch for it was to know of a truth
that there was something the matter with HIM; since--strangely, with so
little to go upon--his heart had positively begun to beat to the time of
suspense. It fairly befell at last for a climax that they almost ceased
to pretend--to pretend, that is, to cheat each other with forms. The unspoken
had come up, and there was a crisis--neither could have said how long it
lasted--during which they were reduced, for all interchange, to looking
at each other on quite an inordinate scale. They might at this moment,
in their positively portentous stillness, have been keeping it up for a
wager, sitting for their photograph or even enacting a tableau-vivant.

<P>The spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have
read meanings of his own into the intensity of their communion--or indeed,
even without meanings, have found his account, aesthetically, in some gratified
play of our modern sense of type, so scantly to be distinguished from our
modern sense of beauty. Type was there, at the worst, in Mrs. Assingham's
dark neat head, on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so
numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she
(34) desired. Full of discriminations against the obvious, she had yet
to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the best of misleading signs.
Her richness of hue, her generous nose, her eyebrows marked like those
of an actress--these things, with an added amplitude of person on which
middle age had set its seal, seemed to present her insistently as a daughter
of the South, or still more of the East, a creature formed by hammocks
and divans, fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves. She looked as
if her most active effort might be to take up, as she lay back, her mandolin,
or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle. She was in fact however
neither a pampered Jewess nor a lazy Creole; New York had been recordedly
her birth place and "Europe" punctually her discipline. She wore yellow
and purple because she thought it better, as she said, while one was about
it, to look like the Queen of Sheba than like a revendeuse; she put pearls
in her hair and crimson and gold in her tea-gown for the same reason: it
was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only
course was to drown, as it was hopeless to try to chasten, the over dressing.
So she was covered and surrounded with "things," which were frankly toys
and shams, a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her
friends. These friends were in the game--that of playing with the disparity
between her aspect and her character. Her character was attested by the
second movement of her face, which convinced the be holder that her vision
of the humours of the world was not supine, not passive. She enjoyed, she
needed the warm air of friendship, but the eyes of the American (35) city
looked out, somehow, for the opportunity of it, from under the lids of
Jerusalem. With her false indolence, in short, her false leisure, her false
pearls and palms and courts and fountains, she was a person for whom life
was multitudinous detail, detail that left her, as it at any moment found
her, unappalled and unwearied.

<P>"Sophisticated as I may appear"--it was her frequent phrase--she had
found sympathy her best resource. It gave her plenty to do; it made her,
as she also said, sit up. She had in her life two great holes to fill,
and she described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she had
known old ladies, in her early American time, drop morsels of silk into
the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork
quilt. One of these gaps in Mrs. Assingham's completeness was her want
of children; the other was her want of wealth. It was wonderful how little
either, in the fulness of time, came to show; sympathy and curiosity could
render their objects practically filial, just as an English husband who
in his military years had "run" everything in his regiment could make economy
blossom like the rose. Colonel Bob had, a few years after his marriage,
left the army, which had clearly by that time done its laudable all for
the enrichment of his personal experience, and he could thus give his whole
time to the gardening in question. There reigned among the younger friends
of this couple a legend, almost too venerable for historical criticism,
that the marriage itself, the happiest of its class, dated from the far
twilight of the age, a primitive period when such things--such things as
(36) American girls accepted as "good enough"--had n't begun to be; so
that the pleasant pair had been, as to the risk taken on either side, bold
and original, honourably marked, for the evening of life, as discoverers
of a kind of hymeneal Northwest Passage. Mrs. Assingham knew better, knew
there had been no historic hour, from that of Pocahontas down, when some;
young Englishman had n't precipitately believed and some American girl
had n't, with a few more gradations, availed herself to the full of her
incapacity to doubt; but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder,
since she was in fact pretty well the doyenne, above ground, of her transplanted
tribe, and since, above all, she HAD invented combinations, though she
had n't invented Bob's own. It was he who had done that, absolutely puzzled
it out by himself from its first odd glimmer--resting upon it moreover,
through the years to come, as proof enough in him by itself of the higher
cleverness. If she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should
have full credit. There were moments in truth when she privately felt how
little--striking out as he had done--he could have afforded that she should
show the common limits. But Mrs. Assingham's cleverness was in truth tested
when her present visitor at last said to her: "I don't think, you know,
that you're treating me quite right. You've something on your mind that
you don't tell me."

<P>It was positive too that her smile of reply was a trifle dim. "Am I
obliged to tell you everything I have on my mind?"

<P>"It is n't a question of everything, but it's a question (37) of anything
that may particularly concern me. Then you should n't keep it back. You
know with what care I desire to proceed, taking everything into account
and making no mistake that may possibly injure HER."

<P>Mrs. Assingham, at this, had after an instant an odd interrogation.
"'Her'?"

<P>"Her and him. Both our friends. Either Maggie or her father."

<P>I HAVE something on my mind," Mrs. Assingham presently returned; "something
has happened for which I had n't been prepared. But it is n't anything
that properly concerns you."

<P>The Prince, with immediate gaiety, threw back his head. "What do you
mean by 'properly'? I somehow see volumes in it. It's the way people put
a thing when they put it--well, wrong. I put things right. What is it that
has happened for me?"

<P>His hostess had the next moment drawn spirit from his tone. "Oh I shall
be delighted if you'll take your share of it. Charlotte Stant's in London.
She has just been here."

<P>"Miss Stant? Oh really?" The Prince expressed clear surprise--a transparency
through which his eyes met his friend's with a certain hardness of concussion.
"She has arrived from America?" he then quickly asked.

<P>"She appears to have arrived this noon--coming up from Southampton--at
an hotel. She dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than
an hour."

<P>The young man heard with interest, though not (38) with an interest
too great for his gaiety. "You think then I've a share in it? What IS my
share?"

<P>"Why any you like--the one you seemed just now eager to take. It was
you yourself who insisted."

<P>He looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency, and she could
now see that he had changed colour. But he was always easy. "I did n't
know then what the matter was."

<P>"You did n't think it could be so bad?"

<P>"Do you call it very bad?" the young man asked.

<P>"Only," she smiled, "because that's the way it seems to affect YOU."

<P>He hesitated, still with the trace of his quickened colour, still looking
at her, still adjusting his manner. "But you allowed you were upset."

<P>"To the extent--yes--of not having in the least looked for her. Any
more," said Mrs. Assingham, "than I judge Maggie to have done."

<P>The Prince thought; then as If glad to be able to say something very
natural and true: "No--quite right. Maggie has n't looked for her. But
I'm sure," he added, "she'll be delighted to see her."

<P>"THAT certainly"--and his hostess spoke with a different shade of gravity.

<P>"She'll be quite overjoyed," the Prince went on. "Has Miss Stant now
gone to her?"

<P>"She has gone back to her hotel, to bring her things here. I can't have
her," said Mrs. Assingham, "alone at an hotel."

<P>"No; I see."

<P>"If she's here at all she must stay with me."

<P>He quite took it in. "So she's coming now?"

<P>(39) "I expect her at any moment. If you wait you'll see her."

<P>"Oh," he promptly declared--"charming!" But this word came out as if
a little in sudden substitution for some other. It sounded accidental,
whereas he wished to be firm. That accordingly was what he next showed
himself. "If it was n't for what's going on these next days Maggie would
certainly want to have her. In fact," he lucidly continued, "is n't what's
happening just a reason to MAKE her want to?" Mrs. Assingham, for answer,
only looked at him, and this the next instant had apparently had more effect
than if she had spoken. For he asked a question that seemed incongruous.
"What has she come FOR?"

<P>It made his companion laugh. "Why, for just what you say. For your marriage."

<P>"Mine?"--He wondered.

<P>"Maggie's--it's the same thing. It's 'for' your great event. And then,"
said Mrs. Assingham, "she's so lonely."

<P>"Has she given you that as a reason?"

<P>"I scarcely remember--she gave me so many. She abounds, poor dear, in
reasons. But there's one that, whatever she does, I always remember for
myself."

<P>"And which is that?" He looked as if he ought to guess but could n't.

<P>"Why the fact that she has no home--absolutely none whatever. She's
extraordinarily alone."

<P>Again he took it in. "And also has no great means."

<P>"Very small ones. Which is not however, with the (40) expense of railways
and hotels, a reason for her running to and fro."

<P>"On the contrary. But she does n't like her country."

<P>"Hers, my dear man?--it's little enough 'hers.'" The attribution for
the moment amused his hostess. "She has rebounded now--but she has had
little enough else to do with it."

<P>"Oh I say hers," the Prince pleasantly explained, "very much as at this
time of day I might say mine. I quite feel, I assure you, as if the great
place already more or less belonged to me."

<P>"That's your good fortune and your point of view. You own--or you soon
practically own--so much of it. Charlotte owns almost nothing in the world,
she tells me, but two colossal trunks--only one of which I've given her
leave to introduce into this house. She'll depreciate to you," Mrs. Assingham
added, "your property."

<P>He thought of these things, he thought of everything; but he had always
his resource at hand of turning all to the easy. "Has she come with designs
upon me?" And then in a moment, as if even this were almost too grave,
he sounded the note that had least to do with himself. "Est-elle toujours
aussi belle?" That was the furthest point, somehow, to which Charlotte
Stant could be relegated.

<P>Mrs. Assingham treated it freely. "Just the same. The person in the
world, to my sense, whose looks are most subject to appreciation. It's
all in the way she affects you. One admires her if one does n't happen
not to. So, as well, one criticises her."

<P>(41) "Ah that's not fair!" said the Prince.

<P>"To criticise her? Then there you are! You're answered."

<P>"I'm answered." He took it, humorously, as his lesson--sank his previous
self-consciousness, with excellent effect, in grateful docility. "I only
meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with Miss Stant than
to criticise her. When once you begin THAT with any one--!" He was vague
and kind.

<P>"I quite agree that it's better to keep out of it as long as one can.
But when one MUST do it--"

<P>"Yes?" he asked as she paused.

<P>"Then know what you mean."

<P>"I see. Perhaps," he smiled, "I don't know what I mean."

<P>"Well, it's what, just now, in all ways, you particularly should know."
Mrs. Assingham however made no more of this, having before anything else
apparently a scruple about the tone she had just used. "I quite understand
of course that, given her great friendship with Maggie, she should have
wanted to be present. She has acted impulsively--but she has acted generously."

<P>"She has acted beautifully," said the Prince.

<P>"I say 'generously' because I mean she has n't in any way counted the
cost. She'll have it to count in a manner now," his hostess continued.
"But that does n't matter."

<P>He could see how little. "You'll look after her."

<P>"I'll look after her."

<P>"So it's all right."

<P>"It's all right," said Mrs. Assingham.

<P>(42) "Then why are you troubled?"

<P>It pulled her up--but only for a minute. "I'm not--any more than you."

<P>The Prince's dark blue eyes were of the finest and, on occasion, precisely,
resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a Roman palace, of an
historic front by one of the great old designers, thrown open on a feast-day
to the golden air. His look itself at such times suggested an image--that
of some very noble personage who, expected, acclaimed by the crowd in the
street and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for his support,
had gaily and gallantly come to show himself: always moreover less in his
own interest than in that of spectators and subjects whose need to admire,
even to gape, was periodically to be considered. The young man's expression
became after this fashion something vivid and concrete--a beautiful personal
presence, that of a prince in very truth, a ruler, warrior, patron, lighting
up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function. It had been
happily said of his face that the figure thus appearing in the great frame
was the ghost of some proudest ancestor. Whoever the ancestor now, at all
events, the Prince was, for Mrs. Assingham's benefit, in view of the people.
He seemed, leaning on crimson damask, to take in the bright day. He looked
younger than his years; he was beautiful innocent vague. "Oh well, I'M
not!" he rang out clear.

<P>"I should like to SEE you, sir!" she said. "For you would n't have a
shadow of excuse." He showed how he agreed that he would have been at a
loss for one, and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important
(43) as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them. The only
thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established Mrs. Assingham
had a little to explain her original manner, and she came to this before
they dropped the question. "My first impulse is always to behave about

<P>She debated. "A handsome clever odd girl staying with one is always

<P>"I?" He wondered.

<P>"Do you think you could get it out of her for me--the probable length
of her stay?"

<P>He rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge. "I dare say
if you were to give me the chance.

<P>"Here it is then for you," she answered; for she had heard, within the
minute, the stop of a cab at her door. "She's back."
