<P>"I don't quite see, my dear," Colonel Assingham said to his wife the
night of Charlotte's arrival--"I don't quite see, I'm bound to say, why
you take it, even at the worst, so ferociously hard. It is n't your fault,
after all, is it? I'll be hanged at any rate if it's mine."

<P>The hour was late, and the young lady who had disembarked at Southampton
that morning to come up by the "steamer special," and who had then settled
herself at an hotel only to re-settle herself a couple of hours later at
a private house, was by this time, they might hope, peacefully resting
from her exploits. There had been two men at dinner, rather battered brothers-in-arms,
of his own period, casually picked up by her host the day before, and when
the gentlemen, after the meal, rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room,
Charlotte, pleading fatigue, had already excused herself. The beguiled
warriors however had stayed till after eleven--Mrs. Assingham, though finally
quite without illusions, as she said, about the military character, was
always mistress of a spell to old soldiers; and as the Colonel had come
in before dinner only in time to dress he had n't till this moment really
been summoned to meet his companion over the situation that, as he was
now to learn, their visitor's advent had created for them. It was actually
more than midnight, the servants had been sent to bed, the rattle of the
wheels had ceased to come in through a (64) window still open to the August
air, and Robert Assingham had been steadily learning all the while what
it thus behoved him to know. But the words just quoted from him presented
themselves for the moment as the essence of his spirit and his attitude.
He disengaged, he would be damned if he did n't--they were both phrases
he repeatedly used--his responsibility. The simplest, the sanest, the most
obliging of men, he habitually indulged in extravagant language. His wife
had once told him, in relation to his violence of speech, that such excesses
on his part made her think of a retired General whom she had once seen
playing with toy soldiers, fighting and winning battles, carrying on sieges
and annihilating enemies with little fortresses of wood and little armies
of tin. Her husband's exaggerated emphasis was HIS box of toy soldiers,
his military game. It harmlessly gratified in him, for his declining years,
the military instinct; bad words, when sufficiently numerous and arrayed
in their might, could represent battalions, squadrons, tremendous cannonades
and glorious charges of cavalry. It was natural, it was delightful--the
romance, and for her as well, of camp life and of the perpetual booming
of guns. It was fighting to the end, to the death, but no one was ever
killed.

<P>Less fortunate than she, nevertheless, in spite of his wealth of expression,
he had n't yet found the image that described HER favourite game; all he
could do was practically to leave it to her, emulating her own philosophy.
He had again and again sat up late to discuss those situations in which
her finer consciousness abounded, but he had never failed to deny that
anything (65) in life, anything of hers, could be a situation for himself.
She might be in fifty at once if she liked--and it was what women did like,
at their ease, after all; there always being, when they had too much of
any, some man, as they were well aware, to get them out. He would n't at
any price have one, of any sort whatever, of his own, or even be in one
along with her. He watched her accordingly in her favourite element very
much as he had sometimes watched at the Aquarium the celebrated lady who,
in a slight, though tight, bathing-suit, turned somersaults and did tricks
in the tank of water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the non-amphibious.
He listened to his companion to-night, while he smoked his last pipe, he
watched her through her demonstration, quite as if he had paid a shilling.
But it was true that, this being the case, he desired the value of his
money. What was it, in the name of wonder, that she was so bent on being
responsible FOR? What did she pretend was going to happen, and what, at
the worst, could the poor girl do, even granting she wanted to do anything?
What at the worst for that matter could she be conceived to have in her
head?

<P>"If she had told me the moment she got here," Mrs. Assingham replied,
"I should n't have my difficulty in finding out. But she was n't so obliging,
and I see no sign at all of her becoming so. What's certain is that she
did n't come for nothing. She wants"--she worked it out at her leisure--"to
see the Prince again. THAT is n't what troubles me. I mean that such a
fact, AS a fact, is n't. But what I ask myself is What does she want it
FOR?"

<P>(66) "What's the good of asking yourself if you know you don't know?"
The Colonel sat back at his own ease, an ankle resting on the other knee
and his eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely slender foot
which he kept jerking in its neat integument of fine-spun black silk and
patent leather. It seemed to confess, this member, to consciousness of
military discipline, everything about it being as polished and perfect,
as straight and tight and trim, as a soldier on parade. It went so far
as to imply that some one or other would have "got" something or other,
confinement to barracks or suppression of pay, if it had n't been just
as it was. Bob Assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of
person, a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity, which might have
been determined on the part of superior powers by views of transport and
accommodation, and which in fact verged on the abnormal. He "did" himself
as well as his friends mostly knew, yet remained hungrily thin, with facial,
with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect, and with a consequent
looseness of apparel that, combined with a choice of queer light shades
and of strange straw-like textures, of the aspect of Chinese mats, provocative
of wonder at his sources of supply, suggested the habit of tropic islands,
a continual cane-bottomed chair, a governorship exercised on wide verandahs.
His smooth round head, with the particular shade of its white hair, was
like a silver pot reversed; his cheekbones and the bristle of his moustache
were worthy of Attila the Hun. The hollows of his eyes were deep and darksome,
but the eyes within them were like little blue flowers plucked that (67)
morning. He knew everything that could be known about life, which he regarded
as, for far the greater part, a matter of pecuniary arrangement. His wife
accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectual reaction, or rather
indeed of a complete incapacity for either. He never went even so far as
to understand what she meant, and it did n't at all matter, since he could
be in spite of the limitation a perfectly social creature. The infirmities,
the predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him, and indeed--which
was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career--scarce even amused;
he took them for granted without horror, classifying them after their kind
and calculating results and chances. He might in old bewildering climates,
in old campaigns of cruelty and licence, have had such revelations and
known such amazements that he had nothing more to learn. But he was wholly
content, despite his fondness, in domestic discussion, for the superlative
degree; and his kindness, in the oddest way, seemed to have nothing to
do with his experience. He could deal with things perfectly, for all his
needs, without getting near them.

<P>This was the way he dealt with his wife, a large proportion of whose
meanings he knew he could neglect. He edited for their general economy
the play of her mind, Just as he edited, savingly, with the stump of a
pencil, her redundant telegrams. The thing in the world that was least
of a mystery to him was his Club, which he was accepted as perhaps too
completely managing, and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration.
His connexion with it was really (68) a masterpiece of editing. This was
in fact, to come back, very much the process he might have been proposing
to apply to Mrs. Assingham's view of what was now before them; that is
to their connexion with Charlotte Stant's possibilities. They would n't
lavish on them ALL their little fortune of curiosity and alarm; certainly
they would n't spend their cherished savings so early in the day. He liked
Charlotte, moreover, who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he felt
as, with her instincts that made against waste, much more of his own sort
than his wife. He could talk with her about Fanny almost better than he
could talk with Fanny about Charlotte. However, he made at present the
best of the latter necessity, even to the pressing of the question he has
been noted as having last uttered. "If you can't think what to be afraid
of, wait till you CAN think. Then you'll do it much better. Or otherwise,
if that's waiting too long, find out from HER. Don't try to find out from
ME. Ask her herself."

<P>Mrs. Assingham denied, as we know, that her husband had a play of mind;
so that she could, on her side, treat these remarks only as if they had
been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements. She overlooked
them as from habit and kindness; yet there was no one to whom she talked
so persistently of such intimate things. "It's her friendship with Maggie
that's the immense complication. Because THAT," she audibly mused, "is
so natural."

<P>"Then why can't she have come out for it?"

<P>"She came out," Mrs. Assingham continued to meditate," because she hates
America. There was no place for her there--she did n't fit in. She was
n't (69) in sympathy--no more were the people she saw. Then it's hideously
dear; she can't, on her means, begin to live there. Not at all as she can,
in a way, here."

<P>"In the way, you mean, of living with US?"

<P>"Of living with any one. She can't live by visits alone--and she does
n't want to. She's too good for it even if she could. But she will--she
MUST, sooner or later--stay with THEM. Maggie will want her--Maggie will
make her. Besides, she'll want to herself."

<P>"Then why won't that do," the Colonel asked, "for you to think it's
what she has come for?"

<P>"How will it do, HOW?"--she went on as without hearing him. "That's
what one keeps feeling."

<P>"Why should n't it do beautifully?"

<P>"That anything of the past," she brooded, "should come back NOW? How
will it do, how will it do?"

<P>"It will do, I dare say, without your wringing your hands over it. When,
my dear," the Colonel pursued as he smoked, "have you ever seen anything
of yours--anything that you've done--NOT do?"

<P>"Ah I didn't do this!" It brought her answer straight. "I did n't bring
her back."

<P>"Did you expect her to stay over there all her days to oblige you?"

<P>"Not a bit--for I shouldn't have minded her coming after their marriage.
It's her coming this way before." To which she added with inconsequence
"I'm too sorry for her--of course she can't enjoy it But I don't see what
perversity rides her. She need n't have looked it all so in the face--as
she does n't do it, I suppose, simply for discipline. It's almost--that's
the bore of it--discipline to ME."

<P>(70) "Perhaps then," said Bob Assingham, "that's what has been her idea.
Take it, for God's sake, as discipline to you and have done with it. It
will do," he added, "for discipline to me as well."

<P>She was far, however, from having done with it; it was a situation with
such different sides, as she said, and to none of which one could, in justice,
be blind. "It is n't in the least, you know, for instance, that I believe
she's bad. Never, never," Mrs. Assingham declared. "I don't think that
of her."

<P>"Then why is n't that enough?"

<P>Nothing was enough, Mrs. Assingham signified, but that she should develop
her thought. "She does n't deliberately intend, she does n't consciously
wish, the least complication. It's perfectly true that she thinks Maggie
a dear--as who does n't? She's incapable of any PLAN to hurt a hair of
her head. Yet here she is--and there THEY are," she wound up.

<P>Her husband again for a little smoked in silence. "What in the world,
between them, ever took place?"

<P>"Between Charlotte and the Prince? Why nothing--except their having
to recognise that nothing COULD. That was their little romance--it was
even their little tragedy."

<P>"But what the deuce did they DO?"

<P>"Do? They fell in love with each other--but, seeing it was n't possible,
gave each other up."

<P>"Then where was the romance?"

<P>"Why in their frustration, in their having the courage to look the-facts
in the face."

<P>"What facts?" the Colonel went on.

<P>"Well, to begin with, that of their neither of them (71) having the
means to marry. If she had had even a little--a little, I mean, for two--I
believe he would bravely have done it." After which, as her husband but
emitted an odd vague sound, she corrected herself. "I mean if he himself
had had only a little--or a little more than a little, a little for a prince.
They would have done what they could"--she did them justice--"if there
had been a way. But there was n't a way, and Charlotte, quite to her honour,
I consider, understood it. He HAD to have money--it was a question of life
and death. It would n't have been a bit amusing, either, to marry him as
a pauper--I mean leaving him one. That was what she had--as HE had--the
reason to see."

<P>"And their reason is what you call their romance?"

<P>She looked at him a moment. "What do you want more?"

<P>"Did n't HE," the Colonel enquired, "want anything more? Or did n't,
for that matter, poor Charlotte herself?"

<P>She kept her eyes on him; there was a manner in it that half answered.
"They were thoroughly in love. She might have been his--" She checked herself;
she even for a minute lost herself. "She might have been anything she liked--except
his wife."

<P>"But she was n't," said the Colonel very smokingly.

<P>"She was n't," Mrs. Assingham echoed.

<P>The echo, not loud but deep, filled for a little the room. He seemed
to listen to it die away; then he began again. "How are you sure?"

<P>She waited before saying, but when she spoke it was definite. "There
was n't time." (72) He had a small laugh for her reason; he might have
expected some other. "Does it take so much time?"

<P>She herself, however, remained serious. "It takes more than they had."

<P>He was detached, but he wondered. "What was the matter with their time?"
After which, as, remembering it all, living it over and piecing it together,
she only considered, "You mean that you came in with YOUR idea?" he demanded.

<P>It brought her quickly to the point, and as if also in a measure to
answer herself. "Not a bit of it--THEN. But you surely recall," she went
on, "the way, a year ago, everything took place. They had parted before
he had ever heard of Maggie."

<P>"Why had n't he heard of her from Charlotte herself?"

<P>"Because she had never spoken of her."

<P>"Is that also," the Colonel enquired, "what she has told you?"

<P>"I'm not speaking," his wife returned, "of what she has told me. That's
one thing. I'm speaking of what I know by myself. That's another."

<P>"You feel in other words that she lies to you?" Bob Assingham more sociably
asked.

<P>She neglected the question, treating it as gross. "She never so much,
at the time, as named Maggie."

<P>It was so positive that it appeared to strike him. ' It's he then who
has told you?"

<P>She after a moment admitted it. "It's he."

<P>"And he does n't lie?"

<P>"No--to do him justice. I believe he absolutely does n't. If I had n't
believed it," Mrs. Assingham (73) declared for her general justification,
"I'd have had nothing to do with him--that is in this connexion. He's a
gentleman--I mean ALL as much of one as he ought to be. And he had nothing
to gain. That helps," she added, "even a gentleman. It was I who named
Maggie to him--a year from last May. He had never heard of her before."

<P>"Then it's grave," said the Colonel.

<P>She briefly weighed it. "Do you mean grave for me?"

<P>"Oh that everything's grave for 'you' is what we take for granted and
are fundamentally talking about. It's grave--it WAS--for Charlotte. And
it's grave for Maggie. That is it WAS--when he did see her. Or when she
did see him."

<P>"You don't torment me as much as you would like," she presently went
on, "because you think of nothing that I have n't a thousand times thought
of, and because I think of everything that you never will. It would all,"
she recognised, "have been grave if it had n't all been right. You can't
make out," she contended, "that we got to Rome before the end of February."

<P>He more than agreed. "There's nothing in life, my dear, that I CAN make
out."

<P>Well, there was apparently nothing in life that she at real need couldn't.
"Charlotte, who had been there that year from early, early in November,
left suddenly, you'll quite remember, about the tenth of April. She was
to have stayed on--she was to have stayed, naturally, more or less, for
us; and she was to have stayed all the more that the Ververs. due all winter,
(74) but delayed, week after week, in Paris, were at last really coming.
They were coming--that is Maggie was--largely to see her, and above all
to be with her THERE. It was all altered--by Charlotte's going to Florence.
She went from one day to the other--you forget everything. She gave her
reasons, but I thought It odd at the time; I had a sense that something
must have happened. The difficulty was that though I knew a little I did
n't know enough. I did n't know her relation with him had been, as you
say, a 'near' thing--that is I did n't know HOW near. The poor girl's departure
was a flight--she went to save herself."

<P>He had listened more than he showed--as came out in his tone. "To save
herself?"

<P>"Well, also really I think to save him too. I saw it afterwards--I see
it all now. He'd have been sorry--he did n't want to hurt her."

<P>"Oh I dare say," the Colonel laughed. "They generally don't!"

<P>"At all events," his wife pursued, "she escaped--they both did; for
they had had simply to face it. Their marriage could n't be, and, if that
was so, the sooner they put the Apennines between them the better. It had
taken them, it's true, some time to feel this and to find it out. They
had met constantly, and not always publicly, all that winter; they had
met more than was known--though it was a good deal known. More, certainly,"
she said, "than I then imagined--though I don't know what difference it
would after all have made with me. I liked him, I thought him charming,
from the first of our knowing (75) him; and now, after more than a year,
he has done nothing to spoil it. And there are things he might have done--things
that many men easily would. Therefore I believe in him, and I was right,
at first, in knowing I was going to. So I have n't"--and she stated it
as she might have quoted from a slate, after adding up the items, the sum
of a column of figures--"so I have n't, I say to myself, been, fool."

<P>"Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have? All their
case wants, at any rate," Bob Assingham declared, "is that you should leave
it well alone. It's theirs now; they've bought it, over the counter, and
paid for it. It has ceased to be yours."

<P>"Of which case," she asked, " are you speaking?"

<P>He smoked a minute: then with a groan: "Lord, are there so many?"

<P>"There's Maggie's and the Prince's, and there's the Prince's and Charlotte's."

<P>"Oh yes; and then," the Colonel scoffed, "there's Charlotte's and the
Prince's."

<P>"There's Maggie's and Charlotte's," she went on--"and there's also Maggie's
and mine. I think too that there's Charlotte's and mine. Yes," she mused,
"Charlotte's and mine is certainly a case. In short, you see, there are
plenty. But I mean," she said, "to keep my head."

<P>"Are we to settle them all," he enquired, " to-night?"

<P>"I should lose it if things had happened otherwise--if I had acted with
any folly." She had gone on in her earnestness, unheeding of his question.
"I should n't be able to bear that now. But my good conscience is my strength;
no one can accuse me. The (76) Ververs came on to Rome alone--Charlotte,
after heir days with her in Florence, had decided about America. Maggie,
I dare say, had helped her; she must have made her a present, and a handsome
one, so that many things were easy. Charlotte left them, came to England,
' joined ' somebody or other, sailed or New York. I have still her letter
from Milan, telling me; I did n't know at the moment all that was behind
it, but I felt in it nevertheless the undertaking of a new life. Certainly,
in any case, it cleared THAT air--I mean the dear old Roman, in which we
were steeped. It left the field free--it gave me a free hand. There was
no question for me of anybody else when [ brought the two others together.
More than that, here was no question for THEM. So you see," she concluded,
"where that puts me."

<P>She got up, on the words, very much as if they were the blue daylight
towards which, through a darksome tunnel, she had been pushing her way,
and the elation in her voice, combined with her recovered alertness, night
have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shoots at last into
the open. She turned about the room; she looked out a moment into the August
night; she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases.
Yes, it was distinctly as if she had proved what was needing proof, as
if the issue of her operation lad been almost unexpectedly a success. Old
arithmetic had perhaps been fallacious, but the new settled the question.
Her husband oddly, however, kept his place without apparently measuring
these results. As he had been amused at her intensity, so he was n't uplifted
by her relief; his interest might in fact have (77) been more enlisted
than he allowed. "Do you mean," he presently asked, "that he had already
forgot about Charlotte?"

<P>She faced round as if he had touched a spring. "He WANTED to, naturally--and
it was much the best thing he could do." She was in possession of the main
case, as it truly seemed; she had it all now. "He was capable of the effort,
and he took the best way. Remember too what Maggie then seemed to us."

<P>"She's very nice, but she always seems to me more than anything else
the young woman who has a million a year. If you mean that that's what
she especially seemed to him you of course place the thing in your light.
The effort to forget Charlotte could n't, I grant you, have been so difficult."

<P>This pulled her up but for an instant. "I never said he did n't from
the first--I never said that he does n't more and more--like Maggie's money."

<P>"I never said I should n't have liked it myself," Bob Assingham returned.
He made no movement; he smoked another minute. "How much did Maggie know?"

<P>"How much?" She seemed to consider--as if it were between quarts and
gallons--how best to express the quantity. "She knew what Charlotte, in
Florence, had told her."

<P>"And what HAD Charlotte told her?"

<P>"Very little."

<P>"What makes you so sure?"

<P>"Why this--that she COULD N'T tell her." And she explained a little
what she meant. "There are things, my dear--have n't you felt it yourself,
coarse as you (78) are?--that no one could tell Maggie. There are things
that, upon my word, I should n't care to attempt to tell her now."

<P>The Colonel smoked on it. "She'd be so scandalised?"

<P>"She'd be so frightened. She'd be, in her strange little way, so hurt.
She was n't born to know evil. She must never know it."

<P>Bob Assingham had a queer grim laugh; the sound of which in fact fixed
his wife before him. "We're taking grand ways to prevent it."

<P>But she stood there to protest. "We're not taking any ways. The ways
are all taken; they were taken from the moment he came up to our carriage
that day in Villa Borghese--the second or third of her days in Rome, when,
as you remember, you went off somewhere with Mr. Verver, and the Prince,
who had got into the carriage with us, came home with us to tea. They had
met; they had seen each other well; they were in relation: the rest was
to come of itself and as it could. It began, practically, I recollect,
in our drive. Maggie happened to learn, by some other man's greeting of
him, in the bright Roman way, from a street-corner as we passed, that one
of the Prince's baptismal names, the one always used for him among his
relations, was Amerigo: which--as you probably don't know, however, even
after a lifetime of me--was the name, four hundred years ago, or whenever,
of the pushing man who followed, across the sea, in the wake of Columbus
and succeeded, where Columbus had failed, in becoming godfather, or name-father,
to the new Continent; so that the thought of any (79) connexion with him
can even now thrill our artless breasts."

<P>The Colonel's grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his
wife's not infrequent imputation of ignorances, on the score of the land
of her birth, unperturbed and unashamed; and these dark depths were even
at the present moment not directly lighted by an enquiry that managed to
be curious without being apologetic. "But where does the connexion come
in?"

<P>She had it ready. "By the women--that is by some obliging woman, of
old, who was a descendant of the pushing man, the make-believe discoverer,
and whom the Prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress.
A branch of the other family had become great--great enough, at least,
to marry into his; and the name of the navigator, crowned with glory, was,
very naturally, to become so the fashion among them that some son, of every
generation, was appointed to wear it. My point is at any rate that I recall
noticing at the time how the Prince was from the start helped with the
dear Ververs by HIS wearing it. The connexion became romantic for Maggie
the moment she took it in; she filled out, in a flash, every link that
might be vague. ' By that sign,' I quite said to myself, 'he'll conquer'--with
his good fortune, of course, of having the other necessary signs too. It
really," said Mrs. Assingham, "WAS, practically, the fine side of the wedge.
Which struck me as also," she wound up, "a lovely note for the candour
of the Ververs."

<P>The Colonel had followed, but his comment was (80) prosaic. "He knew,
Amerigo, what he was about. And I don't mean the OLD one."

<P>"I know what you mean!" his wife bravely threw off.

<P>"The old one"--he pointed his effect--"isn't the only discoverer in
the family."

<P>"Oh as much as you like! If he discovered America--or got himself honoured
as if he had--his successors were in due time to discover the Americans.
And it was one of them in particular, doubtless, who was to discover how
patriotic we are."

<P>"Wouldn't this be the same one," the Colonel asked, "who really discovered
what you call the connexion?"

<P>She gave him a look. "The connexion's a true thing--the connexion's
perfectly historic. Your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind. Don't
you understand," she asked, "that the history of such people is known root
and branch, at every moment of its course?"

<P>"Oh it's all right," said Bob Assingham.

<P>"Go to the British Museum," his companion continued with spirit.

<P>"And what am I to do there?"

<P>"There's a whole immense room, or recess, or department, or whatever,
filled with books written about HIS family alone. You can see for yourself?"

<P>"Have you seen for YOUR self?"

<P>She faltered but an instant. "Certainly--I went one day with Maggie.
We looked him up, so to say. They were most civil." And she fell again
into the current her husband had slightly ruffled. "The effect (81) was
produced, the charm began to work at all events, in Rome, from that hour
of the Prince's drive with us. My only course afterwards had to be to make
the best of it. It was certainly good enough for that," Mrs. Assingham
hastened to add, "and I did n't in the least see my duty in making the
worst. In the same situation to-day I would n't act differently. I entered
into the case as it then appeared to me--and as for the matter of that
it still does. I LIKED it, I thought all sorts of good of it, and nothing
can even now," she said with some intensity, "make me think anything else."

<P>"Nothing can ever make you think anything you don't want to," the Colonel,
still in his chair, remarked over his pipe. "You've got a precious power
of thinking whatever you do want. You want also, from moment to moment,
to think such desperately different things. What happened," he went on,
"was that you fell violently in love with the Prince yourself, and that
as you could n't get ME out of the way you had to take some roundabout
course. YOU could n't marry him, any more than Charlotte could--that is
not to yourself. But you could to somebody else--it was always the Prince,
it was always marriage. You could to your little friend, to whom there
were no objections."

<P>"Not only there were no objections, but there were reasons, positive
ones--and all excellent, all charming." She spoke with an absence of all
repudiation of his exposure of the spring of her conduct; and this abstention,
clearly and effectively conscious, evidently cost her nothing. "It IS always
the Prince, and it is always, thank heaven, marriage. And these are the
(82) things, God grant, that it will always be. That I could help, a year
ago, most assuredly made me happy, and it continues to make me happy."

<P>"Then why are n't you quiet?"

<P>"I AM quiet," said Fanny Assingham.

<P>He looked at her, with his colourless candour, still in his place; she
moved about again a little, emphasising by her unrest her declaration of
her tranquillity. He was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer,
but he was n't to keep it long. "What do you make of it that, by your own
show, Charlotte could n't tell her all? What do you make of it that the
Prince did n't tell her anything? Say one understands that there are things
she can't be told--since, as you put it, she is so easily scared and shocked."
He produced these objections slowly, giving her time, by his pauses, to
stop roaming and come back to him. But she was roaming still when he concluded
his enquiry. "If there had n't been anything there should n't have been
between the pair before Charlotte bolted--in order, precisely, as you say,
that there SHOULD N'T be: why in the world was what there HAD been too
bad to be spoken of?"

<P>Mrs. Assingham, after this question, continued still to circulate--not
directly meeting it even when at last she stopped. "I thought you wanted
me to be quiet."

<P>"So I do--and I 'm trying to make you so much so that you won't worry
more. Can't you be quiet on THAT?"

<P>She thought a moment--then seemed to try. "To relate that she had to
'bolt' for the reasons we speak (83) of, even though the bolting had done
for her what she wished--THAT I can perfectly feel Charlotte's not wanting
to do."

<P>"Ah then if it HAS done for her what she wished--!" But the Colonel's
conclusion hung by the "if" which his wife did n't take up. So it hung
but the longer when he presently spoke again. "All one wonders, in that
case, is why then she has come back to him."

<P>"Say she has n't come back to him. Not really to HIM."

<P>"I'll say anything you like. But that won't do me the same good as your
saying it."

<P>"Nothing, my dear, will do you good," Mrs. Assingham returned. "You
don't care for anything in itself; you care for nothing but to be grossly
amused because I don't keep washing my hands--!"

<P>"I thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that
this is precisely what you do."

<P>But his wife, as it was a point she had often made, could go on as she
had gone on before. "You're perfectly indifferent, really; you're perfectly
immoral. You've taken part in the sack of cities, and I 'm sure you've
done dreadful things yourself. But I DON'T trouble my head, if you like.
'So now there!'" she laughed.

<P>He accepted her laugh, but he kept his way. " Well, I back poor Charlotte."

<P>"'Back' her?"

<P>"To know what she wants."

<P>"Ah then, so do I. She does know what she wants." And Mrs. Assingham
produced this quantity, at last, on the girl's behalf, as the ripe result
of her late wanderings (84) and musings. She had groped through their talk
for the thread and now had got it. "She wants to be magnificent."

<P>"She IS," said the Colonel almost cynically.

<P>"She wants"--his wife now had it fast--"to be thoroughly superior, and
she's capable of that."

<P>"Of wanting to?"

<P>"Of carrying out her idea."

<P>"And what IS her idea?"

<P>"To see Maggie through."

<P>Bob Assingham wondered. "Through what?"

<P>"Through everything. She KNOWS the Prince. And Maggie doesn't. No, dear
thing"--Mrs. Assingham had to recognise it--"she does n't."

<P>"So that Charlotte has come out to give her lessons?

<P>She continued, Fanny Assingham, to work out her thought. "She has done
this great thing for him. That is a year ago she practically did it. She
practically, at any rate, helped him to do it himself--and helped me to
help him. She kept off, she stayed away, she left him free; and what, moreover,
were her silences to Maggie but a direct aid to him? If she had spoken
in Florence; if she had told her own poor story; if she had come back at
any time--till within a few weeks ago; if she had n't gone to New York
and had n't held out there: if she had n't done these things all that has
happened since would certainly have been different. Therefore she's in
a position to be consistent now. She knows the Prince," Mrs. Assingham
repeated. It involved even again her former recognition. "And Maggie, dear
thing, does n't."

<P>(85) She was high, she was lucid, she was almost inspired; and it was
but the deeper drop therefore to her husband's flat common sense. "In other
words Maggie is, by her ignorance, in danger? Then if she's in danger,
there IS danger."

<P>"There WON'T be--with Charlotte's understanding of it. That's where
she has had her conception of being able to be heroic, of being able in
fact to be sublime. She IS, she will be"--the good lady by this time glowed.
"So she sees it--to become, for her best friend, an element of POSITIVE
safety."

<P>Bob Assingham looked at it hard. "Which of them do you call her best
friend?"

<P>She gave a toss of impatience. "I'll leave you to discover!" But the
grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted. "It's for US
therefore to be hers."

<P>"'Hers'?"

<P>"You and I. It's for us to be Charlotte's. It's for us on our side to
see HER through."

<P>"Through her sublimity?"

<P>"Through her noble lonely life. Only--that's essential--it must n't
BE lonely. It will be all right if she marries."

<P>"So we're to marry her?"

<P>"We're to marry her. It will be," Mrs. Assingham continued, "the great
thing I can do." She made it out more and more. "It will make up."

<P>"Make up for what?" As she said nothing, however, his desire for lucidity
renewed itself. "If everything's so all right what is there to make up
for?"

<P>(86) "Why if I did do either of them by any chance a wrong. If I made
a mistake."

<P>"You'll make up for it by making another?" And then as she again took
her time: "I thought your whole point is just that you're sure."

<P>"One can never be ideally sure of anything. There are always possibilities."

<P>"Then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling?"

<P>It made her again look at him. "Where would you have been, my dear,
if I had n't meddled with YOU?"

<P>"Ah that was n't meddling--I was your own. I was your own," said the
Colonel, "from the moment I did n't object."

<P>"Well, these people won't object. THEY are my own too--in the sense
that I 'm awfully fond of them. Also in the sense," she continued, "that
I think they're not so very much less fond of me. Our relation, all round,
exists--it's a reality, and a very good one; we're mixed up, so to speak,
and it's too late to change it. We must live in it and with it. Therefore
to see that Charlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible--that, as
I say, will be one of my ways of living. It will cover," she said with
conviction, "all the ground." And then as his own conviction appeared to
continue as little to match: "The ground, I mean, of any nervousness I
may ever feel. It will be in fact my duty--and I shan't rest till my duty's
performed." She had arrived by this time at something like exaltation.
"I shall give, for the next year or two if necessary, my life to it. I
shall have done in that case what I can."

<P>(87) He took it at last as it came. "You hold there's no limit to what
you 'can'?"

<P>"I don't say there's no limit, or anything of the sort. I say there
are good chances--enough of them for hope. Why should n't there be when
a girl is after all what she is?"

<P>"By after 'all' you mean after she's in love with somebody else?"

<P>The Colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designed to be
fatal; but it scarcely pulled her up. "She's not too much in love not herself
to want to marry. She would now particularly like to."

<P>"Has she told you so?"

<P>"Not yet. It's too soon. But she will. Meanwhile however I don't require
the information. Her marrying will prove the truth."

<P>"And what truth?"

<P>"The truth of everything I say."

<P>"Prove it to whom?"

<P>"Well, to myself, to begin with. That will be enough for me--to work
for her. What it will prove," Mrs. Assingham presently went on, "will be
that she's cured. That she accepts the situation."

<P>He paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe. "The situation
of doing the one thing she can that will really seem to cover her tracks?"

<P>His wife looked at him, the good dry man, as if now at last he was merely
vulgar. "The one thing she can do that will really make new tracks altogether.
The thing that, before any other, will be wise and right. The thing that
will best give her the chance to be magnificent."

<P>(88) He slowly emitted his smoke. "And best give you by the same token,
yours to be magnificent with her?"

<P>"I shall be as magnificent at least as I can."

<P>Bob Assingham got up. "And you call ME immoral?

<P>It made her hesitate a moment. "I'll call you stupid if you prefer.
But stupidity pushed to a certain point IS, you know, immorality. Just
so what is morality but high intelligence?" This he was unable to tell
her; which left her more definitely to conclude "Besides, it's all, at
the worst, great fun."

<P>"Oh if you simply put it at THAT--!"

<P>His implication was that in this case they had a common ground; yet
even thus he could n't catch her by it. "Oh I don't mean," she said from
the threshold " the fun that you mean. Good-night." In answer to which,
as he turned out the electric light, he gave an odd short groan, almost
a grunt. He HAD apparently meant some particular kind.
