<P>He found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to Fanny Assingham,
for their common concerned glance at Eaton Square, the glance that was
so markedly never, as it might have been, a glance at Portland Place: "What
WOULD our cari sposi have made of it here? what would they, you know, really?"--which
overflow would have been reckless if already, and surprisingly perhaps
even to himself, he had n't got used to thinking of this friend as a person
in whom the element of protest had of late been unmistakeably allayed.
He exposed himself of course to her replying: "Ah if it would have been
so bad for them how can it be so good for you?"--but, quite apart from
the small sense the question would have had at the best, she appeared already
to unite with him in confidence and cheer. He had as well his view--or
at least a partial one--of the inner spring of this present comparative
humility, which was all consistent with the retractation he had practically
seen her make after Mr. Verver's last dinner. Without diplomatising to
do so, with no effort to square her, none to bribe her to an attitude for
which he would have had no use in her if it were n't sincere, he yet felt
how he both held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity,
all instinctively, on her just discernible depression. By just so much
as he guessed that she felt herself, as the slang was out of it, out of
(337) the crystal current and the expensive picture, by just so much had
his friendship charmingly made up to her from hour to hour for the penalties,
as they might have been grossly called, of her mistake. Her mistake had
only been, after all, in her wanting to seem to him straight; she had let
herself in for being--as she had made haste, for that matter, during the
very first half-hour at tea to proclaim herself--the sole and single frump
of the party. The scale of everything was so different that all her minor
values, her quainter graces, her little local authority, her humour and
her wardrobe alike, for which it was enough elsewhere, among her bons amis,
that they were hers, dear Fanny Assingham's--these matters and others would
be all now as nought: five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch.
In Cadogan Place she could always at the worst be picturesque--for she
habitually spoke of herself as "local" to Sloane Street: whereas at Matcham
she should never be anything but horrible. And it all would have come,
the disaster, from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship.
To prove to him that she was n't really watching him--ground for which
would have been too terribly grave--she had followed him in his pursuit
of pleasure: SO she might, precisely, mark her detachment. This was handsome
trouble for her to take--the Prince could see it all: it was n't a shade
of interference that a good-natured man would visit on her. So he did n't
even say, when she told him how frumpy she knew herself, how frumpy her
very maid, odiously going back on her, rubbed it into her, night and morning,
with unsealed eyes and lips, that SHE (338) now knew her--he did n't then
say "Ah see what you've done: is n't it rather your own fault?" He behaved
differently altogether: eminently distinguished himself--for she told him
she had never seen him so universally distinguished--he yet distinguished
HER in her obscurity or in what was worse, her objective absurdity, and
frankly invested her with her absolute value, surrounded her with all the
importance of her wit. That wit, as discriminated from stature and complexion,
a sense for "bridge" and a credit for pearls, COULD have importance was
meanwhile but dimly perceived at Matcham; so that his "niceness" to her--she
called it only niceness, but it brought tears into her eyes--had the greatness
of a general as well as of a special demonstration.

<P>"She understands," he said as a comment on all this to Mrs. Verver--"she
understands all she needs to understand. She has taken her time, but she
has at last made it out for herself: she sees how all we can desire is
to give them the life they prefer, to surround them with the peace and
quiet, and above all with the sense of security, most favourable to it.
She can't of course very well put it to us that we have, so far as she
is concerned, but to make the best of our circumstances; she can't say
in so many words 'Don't think of me, for I too must make the best of mine:
arrange as you can, only, and live as you must.' I don't get quite THAT
from her, any more than I ask for it. But her tone and her whole manner
mean nothing at all unless they mean that she trusts us to take as watchful,
to take as artful, to take as tender care, in our way, as she so anxiously
takes in hers. (339) So that she's--well," the Prince wound up, "what you
may call practically all right." Charlotte in fact however, to help out
his confidence, did n't call it anything; return as he might to the lucidity,
the importance, or whatever it was, of this lesson, she gave him no aid
toward reading it aloud. She let him two or three times over spell it out
for himself; only on the eve of their visit's end was she for once clear
or direct in response. They had found a minute together in the great hall
of the house during the half-hour before dinner; this easiest of chances
they had already a couple of times arrived at by waiting persistently till
the last other loiterers had gone to dress and by being prepared themselves
to dress so expeditiously that they might a little later on be among the
first to appear in festal array. The hall then was empty, before the army
of rearranging cushion-patting housemaids were marshalled in, and there
was a place by the forsaken fire, at one end, where they might imitate
with art the unpremeditated. Above all here, for the snatched instants,
they could breathe so near to each other that the interval was almost engulfed
in it and the intensity both of the union and the caution became a workable
substitute for contact. They had prolongations of instants that counted
as visions of bliss; they had slow approximations that counted as long
caresses. The quality of these passages in truth made the spoken word,
and especially the spoken word about other people, fall below them; so
that our young woman's tone had even now a certain dryness. "It's very
good of her, my dear, to trust us. But what else can she do?"

<P>(340) "Why whatever people do when they don't trust. Let one see they
don't."

<P>"But let whom see?"

<P>"Well, let ME, say, to begin with."

<P>"And should you mind that?"

<P>He had a slight show of surprise. "Shouldn't you?"

<P>"Her letting you see--? No," said Charlotte; "the only thing I can imagine
myself minding is what you yourself, if you don't look out, may let HER
see." To which she added: "You may let her see, you know, that you're afraid."

<P>"I'm only afraid of YOU, a little, at moments," he presently returned.
"But I shan't let Fanny see that."

<P>It was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent of Mrs.
Assingham's vision were now a real concern to her, and she gave expression
to this as she had n't even yet done. "What in the world can she do against
us? There's not a word that she can breathe. She's helpless; she can't
speak; she'd be herself the first to be dished by it." And then as he seemed
slow to follow: "It all comes back to her. It all began with her. Everything
from the first. She introduced you to Maggie. She made your marriage."

<P>The Prince might have had his moment of demur, but at this, after a
little, as with a smile dim but deep, he came on. "May n't she also be
said a good deal to have made yours? That was intended, I think, was n't
it? for a kind of rectification."

<P>Charlotte, on her side, for an instant, hesitated; then she was prompter
still. "I don't mean there was (341) anything to rectify; everything was
as it had to be, and I'm not speaking of how she may have been concerned
for you and me. I'm speaking of how she took, in her way, each time, THEIR
lives in hand, and how therefore that ties her up to-day. She can't go
to them and say 'It's very awkward of course, you poor dear things, but
I was frivolously mistaken.'"

<P>He took it in still, with his long look at her. "All the more that she
was n't. She was right. Everything's right," he went on, "and everything
will stay so."

<P>"Then that's all I say."

<P>But he worked it out, for the deeper satisfaction, even to superfluous
lucidity. "We're happy--and they're happy. What more does the position
admit of? What more need Fanny Assingham want?"

<P>"Ah my dear," said Charlotte, "it's not I who say that she need want
anything. I only say that she's FIXED, that she must stand exactly where
everything has, by her own act, placed her. It's you who have seemed haunted
with the possibility for her of some injurious alternative, something or
other we must be prepared for." And she had with her high reasoning a strange
cold smile. "We ARE prepared--for anything, for everything; and AS we are,
practically, so she must take us. She's condemned to consistency; she's
doomed, poor thing, to a genial optimism. That, luckily for her however,
is very much the law of her nature. She was born to soothe and to smooth.
Now then therefore," Mrs. Verver gently laughed, "she has the chance of
her life!"

<P>"So that her present professions may even at the (342) best not be sincere?--may
be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gaining time?"

<P>The Prince had looked, with the question, as if this again could trouble
him, and it determined in his companion a slight impatience. "You keep
talking about such things as if they were our affair at all. I feel at
any rate that I've nothing to do with her doubts and fears or with anything
she may feel. She must arrange all that for herself. It's enough for me
that she 11 always be of necessity much more afraid for herself, REALLY,
either to see or to speak, than we should be to have her do it even if
we were the idiots and cowards we are n't." And Charlotte's face, with
these words--to the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise
have been in them--fairly lightened, softened, shone out. It reflected
as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck. It made her look for
the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption--so
apt is the countenance, as with a finer consciousness than the tongue,
to betray a sense of this particular lapse. She might indeed the next instant
have seen her friend wince, in advance, at her use of a word that WAS already
on her lips; for it was still unmistakeable with him that there were things
he could prize, forms of fortune he could cherish, without at all proportionately
liking their names. Had all this, however, been even completely present
to his companion, what other term could she have applied to the strongest
and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it? She applied
it then, though her own instinct moved her at the same time to pay her
tribute to the good (343) taste from which they had n't heretofore by a
hair's breadth deviated. "If it did n't sound so vulgar I should say that
we're--fatally, as it were--SAFE. Pardon the low expression--since it's
what we happen to be. We're so because THEY are. And they're so because
they can't be anything else from the moment that, having originally intervened
for them, she would n't now be able to bear herself if she did n't keep
them so. That's the way she's inevitably WITH us," said Charlotte over
her smile. "We hang essentially together."

<P>Well, the Prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him. Every
way it worked out. "Yes, I see. We hang essentially together."

<P>His friend had a shrug--a shrug that had a grace. "Cosa volete?" The
effect, beautifully, nobly, was more than Roman. "Ah beyond doubt it's
a case."

<P>He stood looking at her. "It's a case. There can't," he said, "have
been many."

<P>"Perhaps never, never, never any other. That," she smiled, "I confess
I should like to think. Only ours."

<P>"Only ours--most probably. Speriamo." To which, as after hushed connexions,
he presently added: "Poor Fanny!" But Charlotte had already with a start
and a warning hand turned from a glance at the clock. She sailed away to
dress, while he watched her reach the staircase. His eyes followed her
till, with a simple swift look round at him, she vanished. Something in
the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation,
which he breathed again upon the air. "Poor, poor Fanny!"

<P>(344) It was to prove on the morrow quite consistent with the spirit
of these words that, the party at Matcham breaking up and multitudinously
dispersing, he should be able to meet the question of the social side of
the process of returning to whence he had come with due presence of mind.
It was impossible, for reasons, that he should travel to town with the
Assinghams; it was impossible for the same reasons that he should travel
to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twenty-four hours
been privately, and it might have been said profoundly, thinking out. The
result of his thought was already precious to him, and this put at his
service, he sufficiently believed, the right tone for disposing of his
elder friend's suggestion, an assumption in fact equally full and mild,
that he and Charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy
the same compartment as the Colonel and herself. The extension of the idea
to Mrs. Verver had been precisely a part of Mrs. Assingham's mildness,
and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades
than her easy perception that the gentleman from Portland Place and the
lady from Eaton Square might now confess, quite without indiscretion, to
simultaneity of movement. She had made, for the four days, no direct appeal
to the latter personage, but the Prince was accidental witness of her taking
a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last
night of their stay. There had been, at this climax, the usual preparatory
talk about hours and combinations, in the midst of which poor Fanny gently
approached Mrs. Verver. She said "You and the Prince, love"--quite, apparently,
(345) without blinking; she took for granted their public withdrawal together;
she remarked that she and Bob were alike ready, in the interest of sociability,
to take any train that would make them all one party. "I feel really as
if all this time I had seen nothing of you"--that gave an added grace to
the candour of the dear thing's approach. But just then it was on the other
hand that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret
of the right tone for doing as he preferred. His preference had during
the evening not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences;
practically without words, without any sort of straight telegraphy, it
had arrived at a felt identity with Charlotte's own. She spoke all for
their friend while she answered their friend's question, but she none the
less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief
from a window. "It's awfully sweet of you, darling--our going together
would be charming. But you must n't mind us--you must suit yourselves:
we've settled, Amerigo and I, to stay over till after luncheon."

<P>Amerigo, with the chink of this gold in his ear, turned straight away,
so as not to be instantly appealed to; and for the very emotion of the
wonder, furthermore, of what divination may achieve when winged by a community
of passion. Charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping
ready for the same foreseen necessity, and had uttered it simply as a consequence
of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing
between them of a word. He had n't, God knew, to take it from her--he was
too conscious of what he (346) wanted; but the lesson for him was in the
straight clear tone that Charlotte could thus distil, in the perfect felicity
of her adding no explanation, no touch for plausibility, that she was n't
strictly obliged to add, and in the truly superior way in which women so
situated express and distinguish themselves. She had answered Mrs. Assingham
quite adequately; she had n t spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than
the smallest that would serve, and she had, above all, thrown off, for
his stretched but covered attention, an image that flashed like a mirror
played at the face of the sun. The measure of EVERYTHING, to all his sense
at these moments, was in it--the measure especially of the thought that
had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb
as never yet under this brush of her having, by perfect parity of imagination,
the match for it. His whole consciousness had by this time begun almost
to ache with a truth of an exquisite order, at the glow of which she too
had so unmistakeably then been warming herself--the truth that the occasion
constituted by the last few days could n't possibly, save by some poverty
of their own, refuse them some still other and still greater beauty. It
had already told them, with an hourly voice, that it had a meaning--a meaning
that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips, after the
plough through the sands and the sight, afar, of the palm-cluster, might
drink in at last the promised well in the desert. There had been beauty
day after day, and there had been for the spiritual lips something of the
pervasive taste of it; yet it was all nevertheless as if their response
had remained below (347) their fortune. How to bring it by some brave free
lift up to the same height was the idea with which, behind and beneath
everything, he was restlessly occupied, and in the exploration of which,
as in that of the sun-chequered greenwood of romance, his spirit thus,
at the opening of a vista, met hers. They were already from that moment
so hand-in-hand in the place that he found himself making use five minutes
later of exactly the same tone as Charlotte's for telling Mrs. Assingham
that he was likewise in the matter of the return to London sorry for what
might n't be.

<P>This had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world--the sense
of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel
for evermore, on the general head, conveniently at his ease with her. He
went in fact a step further than Charlotte--put the latter forward as creating
his necessity. She was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess--as
a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home. He must
deliver her safe and sound, he felt, in Eaton Square. Regret as he might
too the difference made by this obligation, he frankly did n't mind, inasmuch
as, over and above the pleasure itself, his scruple would certainly gratify
both Mr. Verver and Maggie. They never yet had absolutely and entirely
learned, he even found deliberation to intimate, how little he really neglected
the first--as it seemed nowadays quite to have become--of his domestic
duties: therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his
effort to make them remark it. To which he added with equal lucidity that
they would return in time for dinner, (348) and if he did n't, as a last
word, subjoin that it would be "lovely" of Fanny to find, on her own return,
a moment to go to Eaton Square and report them as struggling bravely on,
this was n't because the impulse, down to the very name for the amiable
act, altogether failed to rise. His inward assurance, his general plan,
had at moments, where she was concerned, its drops of continuity, and nothing
would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him, however
tempted, any element of conscious "cheek." But he was always--that was
really the upshot--cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate:
it was a long lesson, this unlearning, with people of English race, ALL
the little superstitions that accompany friendship. Mrs. Assingham herself
was the first to say that she would unfailingly "report"; she brought it
out in fact, he thought, quite wonderfully--having attained the summit
of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal
to Charlotte from this passage with himself. She had taken the five minutes,
obviously, amid the rest of the talk and the movement, to retire into her
tent for meditation--which showed, among several things, the impression
Charlotte had made on her. It was from the tent she emerged as with arms
refurbished; though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now
met him spoke most, really, of the glitter of battle or of the white waver
of the flag of truce? The parley was short either way; the gallantry of
her offer was all sufficient.

<P>"I'll go to our friends then--I'll ask for luncheon. I'll tell them
when to expect you."

<P>(349) "That will be charming. Say we're all right."

<P>"All right--precisely. I can't say more," Mrs. Assingham smiled.

<P>"No doubt." But he considered as for the possible importance of it.
"Neither can you, by what I seem to feel, say less."

<P>"Oh I WON'T say less!" Fanny laughed; with which the next moment she
had turned away. But they had it again, not less bravely, on the morrow,
after breakfast, in the thick of the advancing carriages and the exchange
of farewells. "I think I'll send home my maid from Euston," she was then
prepared to amend, "and go to Eaton Square straight. So you can be easy."

<P>"Oh I think we're easy," the Prince returned. "Be sure to SAY, at any
rate, that we're bearing up."

<P>"You're bearing up--good. And Charlotte returns to dinner?"

<P>"To dinner. We're not likely, I think, to make another night away."

<P>"Well then I wish you at least a pleasant day."

<P>"Oh," he laughed as they separated, "we shall do our best for it!"--after
which, in due course, with the announcement of their conveyance, the Assinghams
rolled off.
