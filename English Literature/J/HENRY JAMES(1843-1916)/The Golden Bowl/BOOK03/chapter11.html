<P>"I can't say more," this made his companion reply, "than that something
in her face, her voice and her whole manner acted upon me as nothing in
her had ever acted before; and just for the reason, above all, that I felt
her trying her very best--and her very best, poor duck, is very good---to
be quiet and natural. It's when one sees people who always ARE natural
making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it--then it is that one
knows something's the matter. I can't describe my impression--you'd have
had it for yourself. And the only thing that ever CAN be the matter with
Maggie is that. By 'that' I mean her beginning to doubt. To doubt, for
the first time," Mrs. Assingham wound up, "of her wonderful little judgement
of her wonderful little world."

<P>It was impressive, Fanny's vision, and the Colonel, as if himself agitated
by it, took another turn of prowling. "To doubt of fidelity--to doubt of
friendship! Poor duck indeed! It will go hard with her. But she'll put
it all," he concluded, "on Charlotte."

<P>Mrs. Assingham, still darkly contemplative, denied this with a headshake.
"She won't 'put' it anywhere. She won't do with it anything any one else
would. She'll take it all herself."

<P>"You mean she'll make it out her own fault?"

<P>"Yes--she'll find means somehow to arrive at

<P>(381) "Ah then," the Colonel dutifully declared, "she's indeed a little
brick!"

<P>"Oh," his wife returned, "you'll see in one way or another to what tune!"
And she spoke, of a sudden, with an approach to elation--so that, as if
immediately feeling his surprise, she turned round to him. "She'll see
me somehow through!"

<P>"See YOU--?"

<P>"Yes, me. I'm the worst. For," said Fanny Assingham, now with a harder
exaltation, "I did it all. I recognise that--I accept it. She won't cast
it up at me--she won't cast up anything. So I throw myself upon her--she'll
bear me up." She spoke almost volubly--she held him with her sudden sharpness.
"She'll carry the whole weight of us."

<P>There was still nevertheless wonder in it. "You mean she won't mind?
I SAY, love--!" And he not unkindly stared. "Then where's the difficulty?"

<P>"There is n't any!" Fanny declared with the same rich emphasis.

<P>It kept him indeed, as by the loss of the thread, looking at her longer.
"Ah you mean there is n't any for US!"

<P>She met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed
a selfishness, a concern for their own surface at any cost. Then she might
have been deciding that their own surface was after all what they had most
to consider. "Not," she said with dignity, "if we properly keep our heads."
She appeared even to signify that they would begin by keeping them now.
This was what it was to have at last a constituted basis. "Do you remember
what you (382) said to me that night of my first REAL anxiety--after the
Foreign Office party?"

<P>"In the carriage--as we came home?" Yes--he could recall it. "Leave
them to pull through?"

<P>"Precisely. 'Trust their own wit,' you practically said, 'to save all
appearances.' Well, I've trusted it. I HAVE left them to pull through."

<P>He considered. "And your point is that they're not doing so?"

<P>"I've left them," she went on, "but now I see how and where. I've been
leaving them all the while, with out knowing it, to HER."

<P>"To the Princess?"

<P>"And that's what I mean," Mrs. Assingham pensively pursued. "That's
what happened to me with her to-day," she continued to explain. "It came
home to me that that's what I've really been doing."

<P>"Oh I see."

<P>"I need n't torment myself. She has taken them over."

<P>The Colonel declared that he "saw"; yet it was as if, at this, he a
little sightlessly stared. "But what then has happened, from one day to
the other, to HER? What has opened her eyes?"

<P>"They were never really shut. She misses him."

<P>"Then why has n't she missed him before?"

<P>Well, facing him there, among their domestic glooms and glints, Fanny
worked it out. "She did--but she would n't let herself know it. She had
her reason--she wore her blind. Now at last her situation has come to a
head. To-day she does know it. (383) And that's illuminating. It has been,"
Mrs. Assingham wound up, "illuminating to ME."

<P>Her husband attended, but the momentary effect of his attention was
vagueness again, and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp. "Poor dear
little girl!"

<P>"Ah no--don't pity her!"

<P>This nevertheless pulled him up. "We may n't even be sorry for her?"

<P>"Not now--or at least not yet. It's too soon--that is if it is n't very
much too late. This will depend," Mrs. Assingham went on; "at any rate
we shall see. We might have pitied her before--for all the good it would
then have done her; we might have begun some time ago. Now however she
has begun to live. And the way it comes to me, the way it comes to me--"
But again she projected her vision.

<P>"The way it comes to you can scarcely be that she'll like it!"

<P>"The way it comes to me is that she WILL live. The way it comes to me
is that she'll triumph."

<P>She said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered
her husband. "Ah then we must back her!"

<P>"No--we must n't touch her. We may n't touch any of them. We must keep
our hands off; we must go on tiptoe. We must simply watch and wait. And
meanwhile," said Mrs. Assingham, "we must bear it as we can. That's where
we are--and it serves us right. We're in presence."

<P>And so, moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents,
she left it till he questioned again. "In presence of what?"

<P>(384) "Well, of something possibly beautiful. Beautiful as it MAY come
off."

<P>She had paused there before him while he wondered. "You mean she'll
get the Prince back?"

<P>She raised her hand in quick impatience: the suggestion might have been
almost abject. "It is n't a question of recovery. It won't be a question
of any vulgar struggle. To 'get him back' she must have lost him, and to
have lost him she must have had him." With which Fanny shook her head.
"What I take her to be waking up to is the truth that all the while she
really HAS N'T had him. Never."

<P>"Ah my dear--!" the poor Colonel panted.

<P>"Never!" his wife inexorably repeated. And she went on without pity.
"Do you remember what I said to you long ago--that evening, just before
their marriage, when Charlotte had so suddenly turned up?"

<P>The smile with which he met this appeal was n't, it was to be feared,
robust. "What have n't you, love, said in your time?"

<P>"So many things, no doubt, that they make a chance for my having once
or twice spoken the truth. I never spoke it more, at all events, than when
I declared, on that occasion, that Maggie was the creature in the world
to whom a wrong thing could least be communicated. It was as if her imagination
had been closed to it, her sense altogether sealed. That therefore," Fanny
continued, "is what will now HAVE to happen. Her sense will have to open."

<P>"I see." He nodded. "To the wrong." He nodded again almost cheerfully--as
if he had been keeping (385) the peace with a baby or a lunatic. "To the
very, VERY wrong."

<P>But his wife's spirit, after its effort of wing, was able to remain
higher. "To what's called Evil--with a very big E: for the first time in
her life. To the discovery of it, to the knowledge of it, to the crude
experience of it." And she gave, for the possibility, the largest measure.
"To the harsh bewildering brush, the daily chilling breath of it. Unless
indeed"--and here Mrs. Assingham noted a limit--"unless indeed, as yet
(so far as she has come, and if she comes no further), simply to the suspicion
and the dread. What we shall see is whether that mere dose of alarm will
prove enough."

<P>He considered. "But enough for what then, dear--if not enough to break
her heart?"

<P>"Enough to give her a shaking!" Mrs. Assingham rather oddly replied.
"To give her, I mean, the right one. The right one won't break her heart.
It will make her," she explained--"well, it will make her, by way of a
change, understand one or two things in the world."

<P>"But is n't it a pity," the Colonel asked, "that they should happen
to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable to her?"

<P>"Oh 'disagreeable'--? They'll have HAD to be disagreeable--to show her
a little where she is. They'll have had to be disagreeable to make her
sit up. They'll have had to be disagreeable to make her decide to live."

<P>Bob Assingham was now at the window, while his companion slowly revolved,
he had lighted a cigarette, (386) for final patience, and he seemed vaguely
to "time" her as she moved to and fro. He had at the same time to do justice
to the lucidity she had at last attained, and it was doubtless by way of
expression of this teachability that he let his eyes roll, for a minute,
as from the force of feeling, over the upper dusk of the room. He had thought
of the response his wife's words ideally implied. "Decide to live--ah yes!--for
her child."

<P>"Oh bother her child!"--and he had never felt so snubbed, for an exemplary
view, as when Fanny now stopped short. "To live, you poor dear, for her
father--which is another pair of sleeves!" And Mrs. Assingham's whole ample
ornamented person irradiated, with this, the truth that had begun, under
so much handling, to glow. "Any idiot can do things for her child. She'll
have a motive more original, and we shall see how it will work her. She'll
have to save HIM."

<P>"To 'save' him--?"

<P>"To keep her father from her own knowledge. THAT"--and she seemed to
see it, before her, in her husband's very eyes--"will be work cut out!"
With which, as at the highest conceivable climax, she wound up their colloquy.
"Good-night!"

<P>There was something in her manner, however--or in the effect at least
of this supreme demonstration--that had fairly, and by a single touch,
lifted him to her side; so that, after she had turned her back to regain
the landing and the staircase, he overtook her, before she had begun to
mount, with the ring of excited perception. "Ah but, you know, that's rather
jolly!"

<P>(387) "'Jolly'--?" She turned upon it again from the foot of the staircase.

<P>"I mean it's rather charming."

<P>"'Charming'--?" It had still to be their law, a little, that she was
tragic when he was comic.

<P>"I mean it's rather beautiful. You just said yourself it would be. Only,"
he pursued promptly, with the impetus of this idea, and as if it had suddenly
touched with light for him connexions hitherto dim--"only I don't quite
see why that very care for him which has carried her to such other lengths,
precisely, as affect one as so 'rum,' has n't also by the same stroke made
her notice a little more what has been going on."

<P>"Ah there you are! It's the question that I've all along been asking
myself." She had rested her eyes on the carpet, but she raised them as
she pursued--she let him have it straight. "And it's the question of an
idiot."

<P>"An idiot--?"

<P>"Well, the idiot that I'VE been in all sorts of ways--so often of late
have I asked it. You're excuseable since you ask it but now. The answer
I saw to-day has all the while been staring me in the face."

<P>"Then what in the world is it?"

<P>"Why the very intensity of her conscience about him--the very passion
of her brave little piety. That's the way it has worked," Mrs. Assingham
explained--"and I admit it to have been as 'rum' a way as possible. But
it has been working from a 'rum' start. From the moment the dear man married
to ease his daughter off and it then happened by an (388) extraordinary
perversity that the very opposite effect was produced--!" With the renewed
vision of this fatality, however, she could give but a desperate shrug.

<P>"I see," the Colonel sympathetically mused. "That WAS a rum start. '

<P>But his very response, as she again flung up her arms, seemed to make
her sense for a moment intolerable. "Yes--there I am! I was really at the
bottom of it," she declared; "I don't know what possessed me--but I planned
for him, I goaded him on." With which, however, the next moment, she took
herself up. "Or rather I DO know what possessed me--for was n't he beset
with ravening women, right and left, and did n't he quite pathetically
appeal for protection, did n't he quite charmingly show one how he needed
and desired it? Maggie," she thus lucidly continued, "could n't, with a
new life of her own, give herself up to doing for him in the future all
she had done in the past--to fencing him in, to keeping him safe and keeping
THEM off. One perceived this," she went on--"out of the abundance of one's
affection and one's sympathy." It all blessedly came back to her--when
it was n't all for the fiftieth time obscured, in face of the present facts,
by anxiety and compunction. "One was no doubt a meddlesome fool; one always
IS, to think one sees people's lives for them better than they see them
for themselves. But one's excuse here," she insisted, "was that these people
clearly DID N'T see them for themselves--did n't see them at all. It struck
one for very pity--that they were making a mess of such charming material;
(389) that they were but wasting it and letting it go. They did n't know
HOW to live--and somehow one could n't, if one took an interest in them
at all, simply stand and see it. That's what I pay for"--and the poor woman,
in straighter communion with her companion's intelligence at this moment,
she appeared to feel, than she had ever been before, let him have the whole
of the burden of her consciousness. "I always pay for it, sooner or later,
my sociable, my damnable, my unnecessary interest. Nothing of course would
suit me but that it should fix itself also on Charlotte--Charlotte who
was hovering there on the edge of our lives when not beautifully and a
trifle mysteriously flitting across them, and who was a piece of waste
and a piece of threatened failure just as, for any possible good to the
world, Mr. Verver and Maggie were. It began to come over me in the watches
of the night that Charlotte was a person who COULD keep off ravening women--without
being one herself, either, in the vulgar way of the others; and that this
service to Mr. Verver would be a sweet employment for her future. There
was something of course that might have stopped me: you know, you know
what I mean--it looks at me," she veritably moaned, "out of your face!
But all I can say is that it did n't; the reason largely being--once I
had fallen in love with the beautiful symmetry of my plan--that I seemed
to feel sure Maggie would accept Charlotte, whereas I did n't quite make
out either what other woman, or what other KIND of woman, one could think
of her accepting."

<P>"I see--I see." She had paused, meeting all the (390) while his listening
look, and the fever of her retrospect had so risen with her talk that the
desire was visibly strong in him to meet her, on his side, but with cooling
breath. "One quite understands, my dear."

<P>Yet it only kept her there sombre. "I naturally see, love, what you
understand; which sits again perfectly in your eyes. You see that I saw
that Maggie would accept her in helpless ignorance. Yes, dearest"--and
the grimness of her lucidity suddenly once more possessed her: "you've
only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason for what I did. How,
when you do, can I stand up to you? You see," she said with an ineffable
headshake, "that I don't stand up! I'm down, down, down," she declared;
"yet"--she as quickly added--"there's just one little thing that helps
to save my life." And she kept him waiting but an instant. "They might
easily--they would perhaps even certainly--have done something worse."

<P>He thought. "Worse than that Charlotte--?"

<P>"Ah don't tell me," she cried, "that there COULD have been nothing worse.
There might, as they were, have been many things. Charlotte, in her way,
is extraordinary."

<P>He was almost simultaneous. "Extraordinary!"

<P>"She observes the forms," said Fanny Assingham.

<P>"With the Prince--?"

<P>"For the Prince. And with the others," she went on. "With Mr. Verver--wonderfully.
But above all with Maggie. And the forms"--she had to do even THEM justice--"are
two thirds of conduct. (391) Say he had married a woman who would have
made a hash of them."

<P>But he jerked back. "Ah my dear, I would n't say it for the world!"

<P>'Say," she none the less pursued, "he had married a woman the Prince
would REALLY have cared for."

<P>"You mean then he does n't care for Charlotte--?"

<P>This was still a new view to jump to, and the Colonel, perceptibly,
wished to make sure of the necessity of the effort. For that, while he
stared, his wife allowed him time; at the end of which she simply said:
"No!"

<P>"Then what on earth are they up to?" Still however she only looked at
him; so that, standing there before her with his hands in his pockets,
he had time to risk soothingly another question. "Are the 'forms' you speak
of--that are two thirds of conduct--what will be keeping her now, by your
hypothesis, from coming home with him till morning?"

<P>"Yes--absolutely. THEIR forms."

<P>"'Theirs'--?"

<P>"Maggie's and Mr. Verver's--those they IMPOSE on Charlotte and the Prince.
Those," she developed, "that so perversely, as I say, have succeeded in
setting themselves up as the right ones."

<P>He considered--but only now at last really to relapse into woe. "Your
'perversity,' my dear, is exactly what I don't understand. The state of
things existing has n't grown, like a field of mushrooms, in a night. Whatever
they, all round, may be in for now (392) is at least the consequence of
what they've DONE. Are they mere helpless victims of fate?"

<P>Well, Fanny at last had the courage of it. "Yes--they are. To be so
abjectly innocent--that IS to be victims of fate."

<P>"And Charlotte and the Prince are abjectly innocent--?

<P>It took her another minute, but she rose to the full height. "Yes. That
is they WERE--as much so in their way as the others. There were beautiful
intentions all round. The Prince's and Charlotte's were beautiful--of THAT
I had my faith. They WERE--I'd go to the stake. Otherwise," she added,
"I should have been a wretch. And I've not been a wretch. I've only been
a double-dyed donkey."

<P>"Ah then," he asked, "what does our muddle make THEM to have been?"

<P>"Well, too much taken up with considering each other. You may call such
a mistake as that by whatever name you please; it at any rate means, all
round, their case. It illustrates the misfortune," said Mrs. Assingham
gravely, "of being too, too charming."

<P>This was another matter that took some following, but the Colonel again
did his best. "Yes, but to whom?--does n't it rather depend on that? To
whom have the Prince and Charlotte then been too charming?"

<P>"To each other in the first place--obviously. And then both of them
together to Maggie."

<P>"To Maggie?" he wonderingly echoed.

<P>"To Maggie." She was now crystalline. "By (393) having accepted, from
the first, so guilelessly--yes, so guilelessly themselves--her guileless
idea of still having her father, of keeping him fast, in her life."

<P>"Then is n't one supposed, in common humanity, and if one has n't quarrelled
with him, and one has the means, and he, on his side, does n't drink or
kick up rows--is n't one supposed to keep one's aged parent in one's life?"

<P>"Certainly--when there are n't particular reasons against it. That there
may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moral of what's before
us. In the first place Mr. Verver is n't aged."

<P>The Colonel just hung fire--but it came. "Then why the deuce does he--oh
poor dear man!--behave as if he were?"

<P>She took a moment to meet it. "How do you know how he behaves?"

<P>"Well, my own love, we see how Charlotte does!"

<P>Again, at this, she faltered; but again she rose. "Ah isn't my whole
point that he's charming to her?"

<P>"Does n't it depend a bit on what she regards as charming?"

<P>She faced the question as if it were flippant, then with a headshake
of dignity she brushed it away. "It's Mr. Verver who's really young--it's
Charlotte who's really old. And what I was saying," she added, "is n't
affected--!"

<P>"You were saying"--he did her the justice--"that they're all guileless."

<P>"That they were. Guileless all at first--quite extraordinarily. It's
what I mean by their failure to see (394) that the more they took for granted
they could work together the more they were really working apart. For I
repeat, Fanny went on, "that I really believe Charlotte and the Prince
honestly to have made up their minds, originally, that their very esteem
for Mr. Verver--which was serious, as well it might be!--would save them."

<P>"I see." The Colonel inclined himself. "And save HIM."

<P>"It comes to the same thing!"

<P>"Then save Maggie."

<P>"That comes," said Mrs. Assingham, "to something a little different.
For Maggie has done the most."

<P>He wondered. "What do you call the most?"

<P>"Well, she did it originally--she BEGAN the vicious circle. For that--though
you make round eyes at my associating her with 'vice'--is simply what it
has been. It's their mutual consideration, all round, that has made it
the bottomless gulf; and they're really so embroiled but because, in their
way, they've been so improbably GOOD."

<P>"In their way--yes!" the Colonel grinned.

<P>"Which was above all Maggie's way." No flicker of his ribaldry was anything
to her now. "Maggie had in the first place to make up to her father for
her having suffered herself to become--poor little dear, as she believed--so
intensely married. Then she had to make up to her husband for taking so
much of the time they might otherwise have spent together to make this
reparation to Mr. Verver perfect. And her way to do this, precisely, was
by allowing the Prince the use, the enjoyment, whatever you may call it,
of (395) Charlotte to cheer his path--by instalments, as it were--in proportion
as she herself, making sure her father was all right, might be missed from
his side. By so much, at the same time, however," Mrs. Assingham further
explained, "by so much as she took her young stepmother, for this purpose,
away from Mr. Verver, by just so much did this too strike her as something
again to be made up for. It has saddled her, you'll easily see, with a
positively new obligation to her father, an obligation created and aggravated
by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice. She began
with wanting to show him that his marriage could never, under whatever
temptation of her own bliss with the Prince, become for her a pretext for
deserting or neglecting him. Then that, in its order, entailed her wanting
to show the Prince that she recognised how the other desire--this wish
to remain, intensely, the same passionate little daughter she had always
been--involved in some degree and just for the present, so to speak, her
neglecting and deserting HIM. I quite hold," Fanny with characteristic
amplitude parenthesised, "that a person can mostly feel but one passion--one
TENDER passion, that is--at a time. Only that does n't hold good for our
primary and instinctive attachments, the 'voice of blood,' such as one's
feeling for a parent or a brother. Those may be intense and yet not prevent
other intensities--as you'll recognise, my dear, when you remember how
I continued, tout betement, to adore my mother, whom you did n't adore,
for years after I had begun to adore you. Well, Maggie"--she kept it up--"is
in the same situation (396) as I was, PLUS complications from which I was,
thank heaven, exempt: PLUS the complication above all of not having in
the least begun with the sense for complications that I should have had.
Before she knew it at any rate her little scruples and her little lucidities,
which were really so divinely blind--her feverish little sense of justice,
as I say--had brought the two others together as her grossest misconduct
could n't have done. And now she knows something or other has happened--yet
has n't heretofore known what She has only piled up her remedy, poor child--some
thing that she has earnestly but confusedly seen as her necessary policy;
piled it on top of the policy, on top of the remedy, that she at first
thought out for herself and that would really have needed since then so
much modification. Her only modification has been the growth of her necessity
to prevent her father's wondering if all, in their life in common, MAY
be so certainly for the best. She has now as never before to keep him unconscious
that, peculiar, if he makes a point of it, as their situation is, there's
anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable, anything morally the
least out of the way. She has to keep touching it up to make it, each day,
each month, look natural and normal to him; so that--God forgive me the
comparison!--she's like an old woman who has taken to 'painting' and who
has to lay it on thicker, to carry it off with a greater audacity, with
a greater impudence even, the older she grows." And Fanny stood a moment
captivated with the image she had thrown off. "I like the idea of Maggie
audacious and impudent--learning to be so to gloss things over. (397) She
could--she even will, yet, I believe--learn it, for that sacred purpose,
consummately, diabolically. For from the moment the dear man should see
it's all rouge--!" She paused, staring at the vision.

<P>It imparted itself even to Bob. "THEN the fun would begin?" As it but
made her look at him hard, however, he amended the form of his enquiry.
"You mean that in that case she WILL, charming creature, be lost?"

<P>She was silent a moment more. "As I've told you before, she won't be
lost if her father's saved. She'll see that as salvation enough."

<P>The Colonel took it in. "Then she's a little heroine."

<P>"Rather--she's a little heroine. But it's his innocence, above all,"
Mrs. Assingham added, "that will pull them through."

<P>Her companion, at this, focussed again Mr. Verver's innocence. "It's
awfully quaint."

<P>"Of course it's awfully quaint! That it's awfully quaint, that the pair
are awfully quaint, quaint with all our dear old quaintness--by which I
don't mean yours and mine, but that of my own sweet country-people, from
whom I've so deplorably degenerated--that," Mrs. Assingham declared, "was
originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my interest
in them. And of course I shall feel them quainter still," she rather ruefully
subjoined, "before they've done with me!"

<P>This might be, but it was n't what most stood in the Colonel's way.
"You believe so in Mr. Verver's innocence after two years of Charlotte?"

<P>(398) She stared. "But the whole point is just that two years of Charlotte
are what he has n't really--or what you may call undividedly--had."

<P>"Any more than Maggie by your theory, eh, has 'really or undividedly,'
had four of the Prince? It takes all she has n't had," the Colonel conceded,
"to account for the innocence that in her too so leaves us in admiration."

<P>So far as it might be ribald again she let this pass. "It takes a great
many things to account for Maggie. What's definite at all events is that--strange
though this be--her effort for her father has up to now sufficiently succeeded.
She has made him, she MAKES him, accept the tolerably obvious oddity of
their relation, all round, for part of the game. Behind her there, protected
and amused and, as it were, exquisitely humbugged--the Principino, in whom
he delights, always aiding--he has safely and serenely enough suffered
the conditions of his life to pass for those he had sublimely projected.
He had n't worked them out in detail--any more than I had, heaven pity
me!--and the queerness has been exactly in the detail. This, for him, is
what it WAS to have married Charlotte. And they both," she neatly wound
up, "help."

<P>"'Both'--?"

<P>"I mean that if Maggie, always in the breach, makes it seem to him all
so flourishingly to fit, Charlotte does her part not less. And her part
is very large. Charlotte," Fanny declared, "works like a horse."

<P>So there it all was, and her husband looked at her a minute across it.
"And what does the Prince work like?"

<P>(399) She fixed him in return. "Like a Prince!" Whereupon, breaking
short off to ascend to her room, she presented her highly-decorated back--in
which, in odd places, controlling the complications of its aspect, the
ruby or the garnet, the turquoise and the topaz, gleamed like faint symbols
of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her argument.

<P>He watched her as if she left him positively under the impression of
her mastery of her subject; yes, as if the real upshot of the drama before
them was but that he had, when it came to the tight places of life--as
life had shrunk for him now--the most luminous of wives. He turned off,
in this view of her majestic retreat, the comparatively faint little electric
lamp that had presided over their talk; then he went up as immediately
behind her as the billows of her amber train allowed, making out how all
the clearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief--how at
last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustained and floated
her. Joining her however on the landing above, where she had already touched
a metallic point into light, he found she had done perhaps even more to
create than to extinguish in him the germ of a curiosity. He held her a
minute longer--there was another plum in the pie. "What did you mean some
minutes ago by his not caring for Charlotte?"

<P>"The Prince's? By his not 'really' caring?" She recalled, after a little,
benevolently enough. "I mean that men don't, when it has all been too easy.
That's how, in nine cases out of ten, a woman IS treated who has risked
her life. You asked me just now how he (400) works," she added; "but you
might better perhaps have asked me how he plays."

<P>Well, he made it up. "Like a Prince?"

<P>"Like a Prince. He IS profoundly a Prince. For that," she said with
expression, "he's--beautifully--a case. They're far rarer, even in the
'highest circles,' than they pretend to be--and that's what makes so much
of his value. He's perhaps one of the very last--the last of the real ones.
So it is we must take him. We must take him all round."

<P>The Colonel considered. "And how must Charlotte--if anything happens--take
him?"

<P>The question held her a minute, and while she waited with her eyes on
him she put out a grasping hand to his arm, in the flesh of which he felt
her answer distinctly enough registered. Thus she gave him, standing off
a little, the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from
her. "Nothing--in spite of everything--WILL happen. Nothing HAS happened.
Nothing IS happening."

<P>He looked a trifle disappointed. "I see. For US."

<P>"For us. For whom else?" And he was to feel indeed how she wished him
to understand it. "We know nothing on earth--!" It was an undertaking he
must sign.

<P>So he wrote, as it were, his name. "We know nothing on earth." It was
like the soldiers' watchword at night.

<P>"We're as innocent," she went on in the same way, "as babes."

<P>"Why not rather say," he asked, "as innocent as they themselves are?"

<P>(401) "Ah for the best of reasons! Because we're much more so."

<P>He wondered. "But how can we be more--?"

<P>"For them? Oh easily! We can be anything."

<P>"Absolute idiots then?"

<P>"Absolute idiots. And oh," Fanny breathed, "the way it will rest us!"

<P>Well, he looked as if there were something in that. "But won't they
know we're not?"

<P>She barely hesitated. "Charlotte and the Prince think we are--which
is so much gained. Mr. Verver believes in our intelligence--but he does
n't matter."

<P>"And Maggie? Does n't SHE know--?"

<P>"That we see before our noses?" Yes, this indeed took longer. "Oh so
far as she may guess it she'll give no sign. So it comes to the same thing."

<P>He raised his eyebrows. "Comes to our not being able to help her?"

<P>"That's the way we SHALL help her."

<P>"By looking like fools?"

<P>She threw up her hands. "She only wants, herself, to look like a bigger!
So there we are!" With which she brushed it away--his conformity was promised.
Something nevertheless still held her; it broke, to her own vision, as
a last wave of clearness. "Moreover NOW," she said, "I see! I mean," she
added, "what you were asking me: how I knew to-day in Eaton Square that
Maggie's awake." And she had indeed visibly got it. "It was by seeing them
together."

<P>"Seeing her with her father?" He fell behind again. "But you've seen
her often enough before."

<P>(402) "Never with my present eyes. For nothing like such a test--that
of this length of the others' absence together--has hitherto occurred."

<P>"Possibly! But if she and Mr. Verver insisted upon it--?"

<P>"Why is it such a test? Because it has become one without their intending
it. It has spoiled, so to speak, on their hands."

<P>"It has soured, eh?" the Colonel said.

<P>"The word's horrible--say rather it has 'changed.' Perhaps," Fanny went
on, "she did wish to see how much she can bear. In that case she HAS seen.
Only it was she alone who--about the visit--insisted. Her father insists
on nothing. And she watches him do it."

<P>Her husband looked impressed. "Watches him?"

<P>"For the first faint sign. I mean of his noticing. It does n't, as I
tell you, come. But she's there for it--to see. And I felt," she continued,
"HOW she's there; I caught her, as it were, in the fact. She could n't
keep it from me--though she left her post on purpose: came home with me
to throw dust in my eyes. I took it all--her dust; but it was what showed
me." With which supreme lucidity she reached the door of her room. "Luckily
it showed me also how she has succeeded. Nothing--from him--HAS come."

<P>"You're so awfully sure?"

<P>"Sure. Nothing WILL. Good-night," she said. "She'll die first."
