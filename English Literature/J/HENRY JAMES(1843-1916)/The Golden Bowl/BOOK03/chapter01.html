<P>Charlotte, halfway up the "monumental" staircase, had begun by waiting
alone--waiting to be rejoined by her companion, who had gone down all the
way, as in common kindness bound, and who, his duty performed, would know
where to find her. She was meanwhile, though extremely apparent, not perhaps
absolutely advertised; but she would n't have cared if she had been--so
little was it by this time her first occasion of facing society with a
consciousness materially, with a confidence quite splendidly, enriched.
For a couple of years now she had known as never before what it was to
look "well"--to look, that is, as well as she had always felt, from far
back, that in certain conditions she might. On such an evening as this,
that of a great official party in the full flush of the London spring-time,
the conditions affected her, her nerves, her senses, her imagination, as
all profusely present; so that perhaps at no moment yet had she been so
justified of her faith as at the particular instant of our being again
concerned with her, that of her chancing to glance higher up from where
she stood and meeting in consequence the quiet eyes of Colonel Assingham,
who had his elbows on the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging
the staircase and who immediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly
familiar signals. This simplicity of his visual attention struck her, even
with the (246) other things she had to think about, as the quietest note
in the whole high pitch--much in fact as if she had pressed a finger on
a chord or a key and created, for the number of seconds, an arrest of vibration,
a more muffled thump. The sight of him suggested indeed that Fanny would
be there, though so far as opportunity went she had n't seen her. This
was about the limit of what it could suggest.

<P>The air, however, had suggestions enough--it abounded in them, many
of them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which, for
our young woman, the hour was brilliantly crowned. She was herself in truth
crowned, and it all hung together, melted together, in light and colour
and sound: the unsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried, the
other jewels, the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that made
her personal scheme a success, the PROVED private theory that materials
to work with had been all she required and that there were none too precious
for her to understand and use--to which might be added lastly, as the strong-scented
flower of the total sweetness, an easy command, a high enjoyment, of her
crisis. For a crisis she was ready to take it, and this ease it was, doubtless,
that helped her, while she waited, to the right assurance, to the right
indifference, to the right expression, and above all, as she felt, to the
right view of her opportunity for happiness--unless indeed the opportunity
itself, rather, were, in its mere strange amplitude, the producing, the
precipitating cause. The ordered revellers, rustling and shining, with
sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword, (247) and yet for
all this but so imperfectly articulate, so vaguely vocal--the double stream
of the coming and the going, flowing together where she stood, passed her,
brushed her, treated her to much crude contemplation and now and then to
a spasm of speech, an offered hand, even in some cases to an unencouraged
pause; but she missed no countenance and invited no protection: she fairly
liked to be, so long as she might, just as she was--exposed a little to
the public, no doubt, in her unaccompanied state, but, even if it were
a bit brazen, careless of queer reflexions on the dull polish of London
faces, and exposed, since it was a question of exposure, to much more competent
recognitions of her own. She hoped no one would stop--she was positively
keeping herself; it was her idea to mark in a particular manner the importance
of something that had just happened. She knew how she should mark it, and
what she was doing there made already a beginning.

<P>When she presently therefore from her vantage saw the Prince come back
she had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and more appointed
for great moments; with its dome of lustres lifted, its ascents and descents
more majestic, its marble tiers more vividly overhung, its numerosity of
royalties, foreign and domestic, more unprecedented, its symbolism of "State"
hospitality both emphasised and refined. This was doubtless a large consequence
of a fairly familiar cause, a considerable inward stir to spring from the
mere vision, striking as that might be, of Amerigo in a crowd; but she
had her reasons, she held them there. she carried them in fact, responsibly
(248) and overtly, as she carried her head, her high tiara, her folded
fan, her indifferent unattended eminence; and it was when he reached her
and she could, taking his arm, show herself as placed in her relation,
that she felt supremely justified. It was her notion of course that she
gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for this discrimination--indeed
of the most evident alone; yet she would have been half-willing it should
be guessed how she drew inspiration, drew support, in quantity sufficient
for almost anything, from the individual value that, through all the picture,
her husband's son-in-law kept for the eye, deriving it from his fine unconscious
way, in the swarming social sum, of outshining, overlooking and overtopping.
It was as if in separation, even the shortest, she half-forgot or disbelieved
how he affected her sight, so that reappearance had in him each time a
virtue of its own--a kind of disproportionate intensity suggesting his
connexion with occult sources of renewal. What did he do when he was away
from her that made him always come back only looking, as she would have
called it, "more so"? Superior to any shade of cabotinage, he yet almost
resembled an actor who, between his moments on the stage, revisits his
dressing-room, and, before the glass, pressed by his need of effect, retouches
his make-up. The Prince was at present for instance, though he had quitted
her but ten minutes before, still more than then the person it pleased
her to be left with--a truth that had all its force for her while he made
her his care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms.
Conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain (249) was what, poor wonderful
man, he could n't help making it; and when she raised her eyes again, on
the ascent, to Bob Assingham, still aloft in his gallery and still looking
down at her, she was aware that, in spite of hovering and warning inward
voices, she even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his lonely vigil to
the lustre she reflected.

<P>He was always lonely at great parties, the dear Colonel--it was n't
in such places that the seed he sowed at home was ever reaped by him; but
nobody could have seemed to mind it less, to brave it with more bronzed
indifference; so markedly that he moved about less like one of the guests
than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police arrangements
or the electric light. To Mrs. Verver, as will be seen, he represented,
with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness, something definite
enough; though her bravery was not thereby too blighted for her to feel
herself calling him to witness that the only witchcraft her companion had
used, within the few minutes, was that of attending Maggie, who had withdrawn
from the scene, to her carriage. Notified at all events of Fanny's probable
presence, Charlotte was for a while after this divided between the sense
of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with, which was a perception
that made in its degree for the prudence, the pusillanimity of postponement,
of avoidance--and a quite other feeling, an impatience that presently ended
by prevailing, an eagerness, really, to BE suspected, sounded, veritably
arraigned, if only that she might have the bad moment over, if only that
she might prove to herself, let alone (250) to Mrs. Assingham also, that
she could convert it to good; if only in short to be "square," as they
said, with her question. For herself indeed particularly it was n't a question;
but something in her bones told her that Fanny would treat it as one, and
there was truly nothing that from this friend she was n't bound in decency
to take. She might hand things back with every tender precaution, with
acknowledgements and assurances, but she owed it to them in any case, and
owed it to all Mrs. Assingham had done for her, not to get rid of them
without having well unwrapped them and turned them over.

<P>To-night, as happened--and she recognised it more and more, with the
ebbing minutes, as an influence of everything about her--to-night exactly
she would, no doubt, since she knew why, be as firm as she might at any
near moment again hope to be for going through that process with the right
temper and tone. She said after a little to the Prince "Stay with me; let
no one take you; for I want her, yes, I do want her, to see us together,
and the sooner the better"--said it to keep her hand on him through constant
diversions, and made him in fact by saying it profess a momentary vagueness.
She had to explain to him that it was Fanny Assingham she wanted to see--who
clearly would be there, since the Colonel never either stirred without
her or, once arrived, concerned himself for her fate; and she had further,
after Amerigo had met her with "See us together? why in the world? has
n't she often seen us together?" to inform him that what had elsewhere
and otherwise happened did n't now matter and that she at any rate well
knew (251) for the occasion what she was about. "You're strange, cara mia,"
he consentingly enough dropped; but, for whatever strangeness, he kept
her, as they circulated, from being waylaid, even remarking to her afresh,
as he had often done before, on the help rendered in such situations by
the intrinsic oddity of the London "squash," a thing of vague slow senseless
eddies, revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over
it, the drop of which, with a consequent refreshing splash or spatter,
yet never took place. Of course she was strange; this, as they went, Charlotte
knew for herself: how could she be anything else when the situation holding
her, and holding HIM, for that matter, just as much, had so the stamp of
it? She had already accepted her consciousness, as we have already noted,
that a crisis for them all was in the air; and when such hours were n't
depressing, which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them,
they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating.

<P>Later on, in a corner to which, at sight of an empty sofa, Mrs. Assingham
had, after a single attentive arrest, led her with a certain earnestness,
this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred. Fanny
had taken it from her: yes, she was there with Amerigo alone, Maggie having
come with them and then, within ten minutes, changed her mind, repented
and departed. "So you're staying on together without her?" the elder woman
had asked; and it was Charlotte's answer to this that had determined for
them, quite indeed according to the latter's expectation, the need of some
seclusion and her companion's (252) pounce at the sofa. They were staying
on together alone, and--oh distinctly!--it was alone that Maggie had driven
away, her father, as usual, not having managed to come. "'As usual'--?"
Mrs. Assingham had seemed to wonder; Mr. Verver's reluctances not having,
she in fact quite intimated, hitherto struck her. Charlotte responded at
any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased--even
though to-night, as she admitted, he had pleaded his not feeling well.
Maggie had wished to stay with him--for the Prince and she, dining out,
had afterwards called in Portland Place, whence, in the event, they had
brought her, Charlotte, on. Maggie had come but to oblige her father--she
had urged the two others to go without her; then she had yielded for the
time to Mr. Verver's persuasion. But here, when they had, after the long
wait in the carriage, fairly got in; here, once up the stairs and with
the rooms before them, remorse had ended by seizing her: she had listened
to no other remonstrance, and at present therefore, as Charlotte put it,
the two were doubtless making together a little party at home. But it was
all right--so Charlotte also put it: there was nothing in the world they
liked better than these snatched felicities, little parties, long talks,
with "I'll come to you to-morrow," and "No, I'll come to YOU," make-believe
renewals of their old life. They were fairly at times, the dear things,
like children playing at paying visits, playing at "Mr. Thompson and Mrs.
Fane," each hoping that the other would really stay to tea. Charlotte was
sure she should find Maggie there on getting home--a remark in which Mrs.
(253) Verver's immediate response to her friend's enquiry had culminated.
She had thus on the spot the sense of having given her plenty to think
about, and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected.
She had plenty to think about herself, and there was already something
in Fanny that made it seem still more.

<P>"You say your husband's ill? He felt too ill to come?"

<P>"No, my dear--I think not. If he had been too ill I would n't have left
him."

<P>"And yet Maggie was worried?" Mrs. Assingham asked.

<P>"She worries easily, you know. She's afraid of influenza--of which he
has had at different times several attacks, though never with the least
gravity."

<P>"But you're not afraid of it?"

<P>Charlotte had for a moment a pause; it had continued to come to her
that really to have her case "out," as they said, with the person in the
world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves,
would help her on the whole more than hinder; and under that feeling ALL
her opportunity, with nothing kept back, with a thing or TWO perhaps even
thrust forward, seemed temptingly to open. Besides, did n't Fanny at bottom
half-expect, absolutely at the bottom half-want, things?--so that she'd
be disappointed if, after what must just have occurred for her, she did
n't get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination,
that cultivation of the fear, of which our young woman had already had
glimpses, that she might have "gone too far" in her (254) irrepressible
interest in other lives. What had just happened--it pieced itself together
for Charlotte-- was that the Assingham sposi, drifting like every one else,
had had somewhere in the gallery, in the rooms, an accidental concussion;
had it after the Colonel, over his balustrade, had observed, in the favouring
high light, her public junction with the Prince. His very dryness in this
encounter would have, as always, struck a spark from his wife's curiosity,
and, familiar, on his side, with all that she saw in things, he must have
thrown her, as a fine little bone to pick, some report of the way one of
her young friends was "going on" with another. He knew perfectly--such
at least was Charlotte's liberal assumption--that she was n't going on
with any one, but she also knew that, given the circumstances, she was
inevitably to be sacrificed, in some form or another, to the humorous intercourse
of the inimitable pair. The Prince meanwhile had also, under coercion,
sacrificed her; the Ambassador had come up to him with a message from Royalty,
to whom he was led away; after which she had talked for five minutes with
Sir John Brinder, who had been of the Ambassador's company and who had
rather artlessly remained with her. Fanny had then arrived in sight of
them at the same moment as some one else she did n't know, some one who
knew Mrs. Assingham and also knew Sir John. Charlotte had left it to her
friend's competence to throw the two others immediately together and to
find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters. This was the little
history of the vision in her that was now rapidly helping her to recognise
a precious chance, the chance that (255) might n't again soon be so good
for the vivid making of a point. Her point was before her; it was sharp,
bright, true; above all it was her own. She had reached it quite by herself;
no one, not even Amerigo--Amerigo least of all, who would have nothing
to do with it--had given her aid. To make it now with force for Fanny Assingham's
benefit would see her further, in the direction in which the light had
dawned, than any other spring she should doubtless yet awhile be able to
press. The direction was that of her greater freedom--which was all in
the world she had in mind. Her opportunity had accordingly, after a few
minutes of Mrs. Assingham's almost imprudently interested expression of
face, positively acquired such a price for her that she may for ourselves,
while the intensity lasted, rather resemble a person holding out a small
mirror at arm's length and consulting it with a special turn of the head.
It was in a word with this value of her chance that she was intelligently
playing when she said in answer to Fanny's last question: "Don't you remember
what you told me, on the occasion of something or other, the other day?
That you believe there's nothing I 'm afraid of? So, my dear, don't ask
me!"

<P>"May n't I ask you," Mrs. Assingham returned, how the case stands with
your poor husband?"

<P>"Certainly, dear. Only when you ask me as if I might n't perhaps know
what to think, it seems to me best to let you see that I know perfectly
what to

<P>Mrs. Assingham had a wait, then, blinking a little, she took her risk.
"You did n't think that if it was (256) a question of any one's returning
to him in his trouble it would be better you yourself should have gone?"

<P>Well, Charlotte's answer to this enquiry visibly shaped itself in the
interest of the highest considerations. The highest considerations were
good humour, candour, clearness and, obviously, the REAL truth. "If we
could n't be perfectly frank and dear with each other it would be ever
so much better, would n't it? that we should n't talk about anything at
all; which however would be dreadful--and we certainly at any rate have
n't yet come to it. You can ask me anything under the sun you like, because,
don't you see? you can't upset me."

<P>"I'm sure, my dear Charlotte," Fanny Assingham laughed, "I don't want
to upset you."

<P>"Indeed, love, you simply COULD N'T even if you thought it necessary--that's
all I mean. Nobody could, for it belongs to my situation that I 'm, by
no merit of my own, just fixed--fixed as fast as a pin stuck up to its
head in a cushion. I'm placed--I can't imagine any one MORE placed. There
I AM!"

<P>Fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied, and
it brought into her own eyes, though she had reasons for striving to keep
them from betrayals, a sort of anxiety of intelligence. "I dare say--but
your statement of your position, however you see it, is n't an answer to
my enquiry. I confess it seems to me at the same time," Mrs. Assingham
added, "to give but the more reason for it. You speak of our being 'frank.'
How can we possibly be anything else? If Maggie has gone off through finding
herself too distressed to stay and if she's willing to (257) leave you
and her husband to show here without her, are n't the grounds of her preoccupation
more or less discussable?"

<P>"If they're not," Charlotte replied, "it's only from their being in
a way too evident. They're not grounds for me--they were n't when I accepted
Adam's preference that I should come to-night without him: just as I accept
absolutely, as a fixed rule, ALL his preferences. But that of course does
n't alter the fact that my husband's daughter rather than his wife should
have felt SHE could after all be the one to stay with him, the one to make
the sacrifice of this hour--seeing especially that the daughter has a husband
of her own in the field." With which she produced, as it were, her explanation.
"I've simply to see the truth of the matter--see that Maggie thinks more
on the whole of fathers than of husbands. And my situation is such," she
went on, "that this becomes immediately, don't you understand? a thing
I have to count with. "

<P>Mrs. Assingham, vaguely heaving, panting a little but trying not to
show it, turned about, from some inward spring, in her seat. "If you mean
such a thing as that she does n't adore the Prince--!"

<P>"I don't say she does n't adore him. What I say is that she does n't
think of him. One of those conditions does n't always at all stages involve
the other. This is just HOW she adores him," Charlotte said. "And what
reason is there in the world, after all, why he and I should n't, as you
say, show together? We've shown together, my dear," she smiled, "before."

<P>Her friend, for a little, only looked at her--speaking (258) then with
abruptness. "You ought to be absolutely happy. You live with such GOOD
people."

<P>The effect of it, as well, was an arrest for Charlotte; whose face however,
all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance, it had the next instant caused
further to brighten. "Does one ever put into words anything so fatuously
rash? It's a thing that must be said, in prudence, FOR one--by somebody
who's so good as to take the responsibility: the more that it gives one
always a chance to show one's best manners by not contradicting it. Certainly,
you'll never have the distress, or whatever, of hearing me complain."

<P>"Truly, my dear, I hope in all conscience not!"--and the elder woman's
spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by
their pursuit of privacy.

<P>To this demonstration her friend gave no heed. "With all our absence
after marriage, and with the separation from her produced in particular
by our so many months in America, Maggie has still arrears, still losses
to make up--still the need of showing how, for so long, she simply kept
missing him. She missed his company--a large allowance of which is, in
spite of everything else, of the first necessity to her. So she puts it
in when she can--a little here, a little there, and it ends by making up
a considerable amount. The fact of our distinct establishments--which has
all the same everything in its favour," Charlotte hastened to declare--"makes
her really see more of him than when they had the same house. To make sure
she does n't fail of it she's always arranging for it--which she did n't
have to do while they lived together. (259) But she likes to arrange,"
Charlotte steadily proceeded; it peculiarly suits her; and the result of
our separate households is really, for them, more contact and more intimacy.
To-night for instance has been practically an arrangement. She likes him
best alone. And it's the way," said our young woman "in which he best likes
HER. It's what I mean therefore by being 'placed.' And the great thing
is, as they say, to 'know' one's place. Does n't it all strike you," she
wound up, "as rather placing the Prince too?"

<P>Fanny Assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish
presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast--so thick were
the notes of intention in this remarkable speech. But she also felt that
to plunge at random, to help herself too freely, would--apart from there
not being at such a moment time for it--tend to jostle the ministering
hand, confound the array and, more vulgarly speaking, make a mess. She
picked out after consideration a solitary plum. "So placed that YOU have
to arrange?"

<P>"Certainly I have to arrange."

<P>"And the Prince also--if the effect for him is the same?"

<P>"Really I think not less."

<P>"And does he arrange," Mrs. Assingham asked, "to make up HIS arrears?"
The question had risen to her lips--it was as if another morsel, on the
dish, had tempted her. The sound of it at once struck her own ear as giving
out more of her thought than she had as yet intended; but she quickly saw
that she must follow it up, at any risk, with simplicity, and that what
(260) was simplest was the ease of boldness. "Make them up, I mean, by
coming to see you?"

<P>Charlotte replied however without, as her friend would have phrased
it, turning a hair. She shook her head, but it was beautifully gentle.
"He never comes."

<P>"Oh!" said Fanny Assingham: with which she felt a little stupid.

<P>"There it is. He might so well, you know, otherwise."

<P>"'Otherwise'?"--and Fanny was still vague.

<P>It passed this time over her companion, whose eyes, wandering to a distance,
found themselves held. The Prince was at hand again; the Ambassador was
still at his side; they were stopped a moment by a uniformed personage,
a little old man, of apparently the highest military character, bristling
with medals and orders. This gave Charlotte time to go on. "He has not
been for three months." And then as with her friend's last word in her
ear: "'Otherwise'--yes. He arranges otherwise. And in my position," she
added, "I might too. It's too absurd we should n't meet."

<P>"You've met, I gather," said Fanny Assingham, "to-night."

<P>"Yes--as far as that goes. But what I mean is that I might--placed for
it as we both are--go to see HIM."

<P>"And DO you?" Fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity.

<P>The perception of this excess made Charlotte, whether for gravity or
for irony, hang fire a minute. (261) "I HAVE been. But that's nothing,"
she said, "in itself, and I tell you of it only to show you how our situation
works. It essentially becomes one, a situation, for both of us. The Prince's
however is his own affair--I meant but to speak of mine."

<P>"Your situation's perfect," Mrs. Assingham presently declared.

<P>"I don't say it is n't. Taken in fact all round I think it is. And I
don't, as I tell you, complain of it. The only thing is that I have to
act as it demands of me."

<P>"To 'act'?" said Mrs. Assingham with an irrepressible quaver.

<P>"Is n't it acting, my dear, to accept it? I do accept it. What do you
want me to do less?"

<P>"I want you to believe that you're a very fortunate person."

<P>"Do you call that LESS?" Charlotte asked with a smile. "From the point
of view of my freedom I call it more. Let it take, my position, any name
you like."

<P>"Don't let it at any rate"--and Mrs. Assingham's impatience prevailed
at last over her presence of mind--"don't let it make you think too much
of your freedom."

<P>"I don't know what you call too much--for how can I not see it as it
is? You'd see your own quickly enough if the Colonel gave you the same
liberty--and I have n't to tell you, with your so much greater knowledge
of everything, what it is that gives such liberty most. For yourself personally
of course," Charlotte went on, "you only know the state of neither needing
it nor missing it. Your husband doesn't treat (262) you as of less importance
to him than some other woman."

<P>"Ah don't talk to me of other women!" Fanny now overtly panted. "Do
you call Mr. Verver's perfectly natural interest in his daughter--?"

<P>"The greatest affection of which he's capable?"--Charlotte took it up
in all readiness. "I do distinctly--and in spite of my having done all
I could think of to make him capable of a greater. I've done, earnestly,
everything I could--I've made it, month after month, my study. But I have
n't succeeded--that has been vividly brought home to me to-night. However,"
she pursued, "I've hoped against hope, for I recognise that, as I told
you at the time, I was duly warned." And then as she met in her friend's
face the absence of any such remembrance: "He did tell me he wanted me
just BECAUSE I could be useful about her." With which Charlotte broke into
a wonderful smile. "So you see I AM!"

<P>It was on Fanny Assingham's lips for the moment to reply that this was
on the contrary what she saw least of all; she came in fact within an ace
of saying: "You strike me as having quite failed to help his idea to work--since
by your account Maggie has him not less, but so much more, on her mind.
How in the world, with so much of a remedy, comes there to remain so much
of what was to be obviated?" But she saved herself in time, conscious above
all that she was in presence of still deeper things than she had yet dared
to fear, that there was "more in it" than any admission she had made represented--and
she had held herself familiar with admissions: so that. not to (263) seem
to understand where she could n't accept, and not to seem to accept where
she could n't approve, and could still less, with precipitation, advise,
she invoked the mere appearance of casting no weight whatever into the
scales of her young friend's consistency. The only thing was that, as she
was quickly enough to feel, she invoked it rather to excess. It brought
her, her invocation, too abruptly to her feet. She brushed away everything.
"I can't conceive, my dear, what you're talking about!"

<P>Charlotte promptly rose then, as might be, to meet it, and her colour
for the first time perceptibly heightened. She looked, for the minute,
as her companion had looked--as if twenty protests, blocking each other's
way, had surged up within her. But when Charlotte had to make a selection
it was always the most effective possible. It was happy now, above all,
for being made not in anger but in sorrow. "You give me up then?"

<P>"Give you up--?"

<P>"You forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me I most deserve
a friend's loyalty? If you do you're not just, Fanny; you're even, I think,"
she went on, "rather cruel; and it's least of all worthy of you to seem
to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your desertion." She spoke,
at the same time, with the noblest moderation of tone, and the image of
high pale lighted disappointment she meanwhile presented, as of a creature
patient and lonely in her splendour, was an impression so firmly imposed
that she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy the last word,
as it is called in such cases, with a perfection (264) void of any vulgarity
of triumph. She merely completed, for truth's sake, her demonstration.
"What's a quarrel with me but a quarrel with my right to recognise the
conditions of my bargain? But I can carry them out alone," she said as
she turned away She turned to meet the Ambassador and the Prince, who,
their colloquy with their Field-Marshal ended, were now at hand and had
already, between them, she was aware, addressed her a remark that failed
to penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence was temporarily
bathed. She had made her point, the point she had foreseen she must make;
she had made it thoroughly and once for all, so that no more making was
required; and her success was reflected in the faces of the two men of
distinction before her, unmistakeably moved to admiration by her exceptional
radiance. She at first but watched this reflexion, taking no note of any
less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor Fanny--poor Fanny left
to stare at her incurred "score," chalked up in so few strokes on the wall;
then she made out what the Ambassador was saying in French, what he was
apparently repeating to her.

<P>"A desire for your presence, Madame, has been expressed en tres-haut
lieu, and I've let myself in for the responsibility, to say nothing of
the honour, of seeing, as the most respectful of your friends, that so
august an impatience is not kept waiting." The greatest possible Personage
had in short, according to the odd formula of societies subject to the
greatest personages possible, "sent for" her, and she asked, in her surprise,
"What in the world does he want to do (265) to me?" only to know, without
looking, that Fanny's bewilderment was called to a still larger application,
and to hear the Prince say with authority, indeed with a certain prompt
dryness: "You must go immediately--it's a summons." The Ambassador, using
authority as well, had already somehow possessed himself of her hand, which
he drew into his arm, and she was further conscious as she went off with
him that, though still speaking for her benefit, Amerigo had turned to
Fanny Assingham. He would explain afterwards--besides which she would understand
for herself. To Fanny, however, he had laughed--as a mark, it seemed, that
for this infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary.
