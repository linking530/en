<P>Fanny, on her arrival in town, carried out her second idea, dispatching
the Colonel to his club for luncheon and packing her maid into a cab, for
Cadogan Place, with the variety of their effects. The result of this for
each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day practically
passed without fresh contact between them. They dined out together, but
it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back that they appeared
on either side to have least to communicate. Fanny was wrapped in her thoughts
still more closely than in the lemon-coloured mantle that protected her
bare shoulders, and her husband, with her silence to deal with, showed
himself not less 0 disposed than usual, when so challenged, to hold up,
as he would have said, his end of it. They had in general in these days
longer pauses and more abrupt transitions; in one of which latter they
found themselves, for a climax, launched at midnight. Mrs. Assingham, rather
wearily housed again, ascended to the first floor, there to sink overburdened,
on the landing outside the drawing-room, into a great gilded Venetian chair--of
which at first however she but made, with her brooding face, a sort of
throne of meditation. She would thus have recalled a little, with her so
free orientalism of type, the immemorially speechless Sphinx about at last
to become articulate. The Colonel, not unlike, on his side, some old pilgrim
(365) of the desert camping at the foot of that monument, went by way of
reconnoissance into the drawing-room. He visited according to his wont
the windows and their fastenings; he cast round the place the eye all at
once of the master and the manager, the commandant and the rate-payer;
then he came back to his wife, before whom for a moment he stood waiting.
But she herself continued for a time to wait, only looking up at him inscrutably.
There was in these minor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of
a suspension of their old custom of divergent discussion, that intercourse
by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now. This familiar pleasantry
seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble;
though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble
was at present to be vulgarly recognised as clear.

<P>There might, for that matter, even have been in Mrs. Assingham's face
a mild perception of some finer sense--a sense for his wife's situation,
and the very situation she was, oddly enough, about to repudiate--that
she had fairly caused to grow in him. But it was a flower to breathe upon
gently, and this was very much what she finally did. She knew he needed
no telling that she had given herself all the afternoon to her friends
in Eaton Square, and that her doing so would have been but the prompt result
of impressions gathered, in quantities, in brimming baskets, like the purple
grapes of the vintage, at Matcham; a process surrounded by him, while it
so unmistakeably went on, with abstentions and discretions (366) that might
almost have counted as solemnities. The solemnities, at the same time,
had committed him to nothing--to nothing beyond this confession itself
of a consciousness of deep waters. She had been out on these waters for
him, visibly; and his tribute to the fact had been his keeping her, even
if without a word, well in sight. He had n't quitted for an hour, during
her adventure, the shore of the mystic lake; he had on the contrary stationed
himself where she could signal to him at need. Her need would have arisen
if the planks of her bark had parted--THEN some sort of plunge would have
become his immediate duty. His present position, clearly, was that of seeing
her in the centre of her sheet of dark water, and of wondering if her actual
mute gaze at him did n't perhaps mean that her planks WERE now parting.
He held himself so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled
off coat and waistcoat. Before he had plunged, however--that is before
he had uttered a question--he saw, not without relief, that she was making
for land. He watched her steadily paddle, always a little nearer, and at
last he felt her boat bump. The bump was distinct, and in fact she stepped
ashore. "We were all wrong. There's nothing."

<P>"Nothing--?" It was like giving her his hand up the bank.

<P>"Between Charlotte Verver and the Prince. I was uneasy--but I'm satisfied
now. I was in fact quite mistaken. There's nothing."

<P>"But I thought," said Bob Assingham, "that that was just what you did
persistently asseverate. You've guaranteed their straightness from the
first."

<P>(367) "No--I've never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition
to worry. I've never till now," Fanny went on gravely from her chair, "had
such a chance to see and to judge. I had it at that place--if I had, in
my infatuation and my folly," she added with expression, "nothing else.
So I did see--I HAVE seen. And now I know." Her emphasis, as she repeated
the word, made her head, in her seat of infallibility, rise higher. "I
know."

<P>The Colonel took it--but took it at first in silence. "Do you mean they've
TOLD you--?"

<P>"No--I mean nothing so absurd. For in the first place I have n't asked
them, and in the second their word in such a matter would n't count."

<P>"Oh," said the Colonel with all his oddity, "they'd tell US."

<P>It made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of his short
cuts, always across her finest flower-beds; but she felt none the less
that she kept her irony down. "Then when they've told you, you'll be perhaps
so good as to let me know."

<P>He jerked up his chin, testing the growth of his beard with the back
of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye. "Ah I don't say that
they'd necessarily tell me that they ARE over the traces."

<P>"They'll necessarily, whatever happens, hold their tongues, I hope,
and I'm talking of them now as I take them for myself only. THAT'S enough
for me--it's all I have to regard." With which, after an instant, "They're
wonderful," said Fanny Assingham.

<P>"Indeed," her husband concurred, "I really think they are."

<P>(368) "You'd think it still more if you knew. But you don't know--because
you don't see. Their situation"--this was what he did n't see--"is too
extraordinary."

<P>"'Too'--?" He was willing to try.

<P>"Too extraordinary to be believed, I mean, if one did n't see. But just
that, in a way, is what saves them. They take it seriously."

<P>He followed at his own pace. "Their situation?"

<P>"The incredible side of it. They make it credible."

<P>"Credible then--you do say--to YOU?"

<P>She looked at him again for an interval. "They believe in it themselves.
They take it for what it is. And that," she said, "saves them."

<P>"But if what it 'is' is just their chance--?"

<P>"It's their chance for what I told you when Charlotte first turned up.
It's their chance for the idea that I was then sure she had."

<P>The Colonel showed his effort to recall. "Oh your idea, at different
moments, of any one of THEIR ideas!" This dim procession, visibly, mustered
before him, and, with the best will in the world, he could but watch its
immensity. "Are you speaking now of something to which you can comfortably
settle down?"

<P>Again for a little she only glowered at him. "I've come back to my belief,
and that I have done so--"

<P>"Well?" he asked as she paused.

<P>"Well, shows I'm right--for I assure you I had wandered far. Now I'm
at home again, and I mean," said Fanny Assingham, "to stay here. They're
beautiful," she declared.

<P>(369) "The Prince and Charlotte?"

<P>"The Prince and Charlotte. THAT'S how they're so remarkable. And the
beauty," she explained, "is that they're afraid for them. Afraid I mean
for the others."

<P>"For Mr. Verver and Maggie?" It did take some following. "Afraid of
what?"

<P>"Afraid of themselves."

<P>The Colonel wondered. "Of 'THEMselves'? Of Mr. Verver's and Maggie's
selves?"

<P>Mrs. Assingham remained patient as well as lucid. "Yes of SUCH blindness
too. But most of all of their own danger."

<P>He turned it over. "That danger BEING the blindness--?"

<P>"That danger being their position. What their position contains--of
all the elements--I need n't at this time of day attempt to tell you. It
contains, luckily--for that's the mercy--everything BUT blindness: I mean
on their part. The blindness," said Fanny, "is primarily her husband's."

<P>He stood for a moment; he WOULD have it straight. "Whose husband's?"

<P>"Mr. Verver's," she went on. "The blindness is most of all his. That
they feel--that they see. But it's also his wife's."

<P>"Whose wife's?" he asked as she continued to gloom at him in a manner
at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention. And then as she
only gloomed: "The Prince's?"

<P>"Maggie's own--Maggie's very own," she pursued as for herself.

<P>(370) He had a pause. "Do you think Maggie so blind?"

<P>"The question is n't of what I think. The question's of the conviction
that guides the Prince and Charlotte--who have better opportunities than
I for judging."

<P>The Colonel again wondered. "Are you so very sure their opportunities
are better?"

<P>"Well," his wife asked, "what is their whole so extraordinary situation,
their extraordinary relation, but an opportunity?"

<P>"Ah my dear, you have that opportunity--of their extraordinary situation
and relation--as much as they."

<P>"With the difference, darling," she returned with some spirit, "that
neither of those matters are, if you please, mine. I SEE the boat they're
in, but I'm not, thank God, in it myself. To-day, however," Mrs. Assingham
added, "to-day in Eaton Square I did see."

<P>"Well then what?"

<P>But she mused over it still. "Oh many things. More somehow than ever
before. It was as if, God help me, I was seeing FOR them--I mean for the
others. It was as if something had happened--I don't know what, except
some effect of these days with them at that place--that had either made
things come out or had cleared my own eyes." These eyes indeed of the poor
lady's rested on her companion's meanwhile with the lustre not so much
of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had at various other
times had occasion to recognise. She desired obviously to reassure him,
but it apparently (371) took a couple of large candid gathering glittering
tears to emphasise the fact. They had immediately for him their usual direct
action: she must reassure him, he was made to feel, absolutely in her own
way. He'd adopt it and conform to it as soon as he should be able to make
it out. The only thing was that it took such incalculable twists and turns.
The twist seemed remarkable for instance as she developed her indication
of what had come out in the afternoon. "It was as if I knew better than
ever what makes them--"

<P>"What makes them?"--he pressed her as she fitfully dropped.

<P>"Well, makes the Prince and Charlotte take it all as they do. It might
well have been difficult to know HOW to take it; and they may even say
for themselves that they were a long time trying to see. As I say, to-day,"
she went on, "it was as if I were suddenly, with a kind of horrible push,
seeing through their eyes." On which, as to shake off her perversity, Fanny
Assingham sprang up. But she remained there under the dim illumination,
and while the Colonel, with his high dry spare look of "type," to which
a certain conformity to the whiteness of inaccessible snows in his necktie,
shirt-front and waistcoat gave a rigour of

<P>.

<P>accent, wastes watching her, they might, at the late hour and in the
still house, have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers driven for
relief under sudden stress to some grim midnight reckoning in an odd corner.
Her attention moved mechanically over the objects of ornament disposed
too freely on the walls of staircase and landing, as to which recognition,
for (372) the time, had lost both fondness and compunction. "I can imagine
the way it works," she said; "it's so easy to understand. Yet I don't want
to be wrong," she the next moment broke out--"I don't, I don't want to
be wrong!"

<P>"To make a mistake, you mean?"

<P>Oh no, she meant nothing of the sort; she knew but too well what she
meant. "I don't make mistakes. But I perpetrate--in thought--crimes." And
she spoke with all intensity. "I'm a most dreadful person. There are times
when I seem not to mind a bit what I've done, or what I think or imagine
or fear or accept; when I feel that I'd do it again--feel that I'd do things
myself."

<P>"Ah my dear!" the Colonel remarked in the coolness of debate.

<P>"Yes, if you had driven me back on my 'nature.' Luckily for you you
never have. You've done everything else, but you've never done that. But
what I really don't a bit want," she declared, "is to abet them or to protect
them."

<P>Her companion turned this over. "What is there to protect them from?--if,
by your now so settled faith, they've done nothing that justly exposes
them."

<P>And it in fact half-pulled her up. "Well, from a sudden scare. From
the alarm, I mean, of what Maggie MAY think."

<P>"Yet if your whole idea is that Maggie thinks nothing--?"

<P>She waited again. "It is n't my 'whole' idea. Nothing's my 'whole' idea--for
I felt to-day, as I tell you, that there's so much in the air."

<P>(373) "Oh in the air--!" the Colonel dryly breathed.

<P>"Well, what's in the air always HAS--has n't it?--to come down to the
earth. And Maggie," Mrs. Assingham continued, "is a very curious little
person. Since I was 'in,' this afternoon, for seeing more than I had ever
done--well, I felt THAT too, for some reason, as I had n't yet felt it."

<P>"For 'some' reason? For what reason?" And then as his wife at first
said nothing: "Did she give any sign? Was she in any way different?"

<P>"She's always so different from any one else in the world that it's
hard to say when she's different from herself. But she has made me," said
Fanny after an instant, "think of her differently. She drove me home."

<P>"Home here?"

<P>"First to Portland Place--on her leaving her father: since she does
once in a while leave him. That was to keep me with her a little longer.
But she kept the carriage and, after tea there, came with me herself back
here. This was also for the same purpose. Then she went home, though I
had brought her a message from the Prince that arranged their movements
otherwise. He and Charlotte must have arrived--if they HAVE arrived--expecting
to drive together to Eaton Square and keep Maggie on to dinner there. She
has everything there, you know--she has clothes."

<P>The Colonel did n't in fact know, but he gave it his apprehension. "Oh
you mean a change?"

<P>"Twenty changes if you like--all sorts of things. She dresses really,
Maggie does, as much for her father--and she always did--as for her husband
(374) or for herself. She has her room in his house very much as she had
it before she was married--and just as the boy has quite a second nursery
there, in which Mrs. Noble, when she comes with him, makes herself, I assure
you, at home. Si bien that if Charlotte, in her own house, so to speak,
should wish a friend or two to stay with her, she really would be scarce
able to put them up."

<P>It was a picture into which, as a thrifty entertainer himself, Bob Assingham
could more or less enter. "Maggie and the child spread so?"

<P>"Maggie and the child spread so."

<P>Well, he considered. "It IS rather rum."

<P>"That's all I claim"--she seemed thankful for the word. "I don't say
it's anything more--but it IS distinctly 'rum.'"

<P>Which after an instant the Colonel took up. "'More'? What more COULD
it be?"

<P>"It could be that she's unhappy and that she takes her funny little
way of consoling herself. For if she WERE unhappy"--Mrs. Assingham had
figured it out--"that's just the way I'm convinced she WOULD take. But
how can she be unhappy, since--as I'm also convinced--she in the midst
of everything adores her husband as much as ever?"

<P>The Colonel at this brooded for a little at large. "Then if she's so
happy please what's the matter?"

<P>It made his wife almost spring at him. "You think then she's secretly
wretched?"

<P>But he threw up his arms in deprecation. "Ah my dear, I give them up
to you. I've nothing more to suggest."

<P>(375) "Then it's not sweet of you." She spoke at present as if he were
frequently sweet. "You admit that it IS 'rum.'"

<P>And this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention. "Has Charlotte
complained of the want of rooms for her friends?"

<P>"Never, that I know of, a word. It is n't the sort of thing she does.
And whom has she after all," Mrs. Assingham added, "to complain to?"

<P>"Has n't she always you?"

<P>"Oh 'me'! Charlotte and I, nowadays--!" She spoke as of a chapter closed.
"Yet see the justice I still do her. She strikes me more and more as extraordinary."

<P>A deeper shade, at the re-echo of the word, had come into the Colonel's
face. "If they're each and all so extraordinary then, is n't that why one
must just resign one's self to wash one's hands of them--to be lost?" Her
face however so met the question as if it were but a flicker of the old
tone that their trouble had now become too real for--her charged eyes so
betrayed the condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough
to firmer ground. He had spoken before in this light of a plain man's vision,
but he must be something more than a plain man now. "Has n't she then,
Charlotte, always her husband--?"

<P>"To complain to? She'd rather die."

<P>"Oh!"--and Bob Assingham's face, at the vision of such extremities,
lengthened for very docility. "Has n't she the Prince then?"

<P>"For such matters? Oh he does n't count."

<P>(376) "I thought that was just what--as the basis of our agitation--he
does do!"

<P>Mrs. Assingham, however, had her distinction ready. "Not a bit as a
person to bore with complaints. The ground of my agitation is exactly that
she never on any pretext bores him. Not Charlotte!" And in the imagination
of Mrs. Verver's superiority to any such mistake she gave, characteristically,
something like a toss of her head--as marked a tribute to that lady's general
grace, in all the conditions, as the personage referred to doubtless had
ever received.

<P>"Ah only Maggie!" With which the Colonel gave a short low gurgle. But
it found his wife again prepared.

<P>"No--not ONLY Maggie. A great many people in London--and small wonder!--bore
him."

<P>"Maggie only worst then?" But it was a question that he had promptly
dropped at the returning brush of another, of which she had shortly before
sown the seed. "You said just now that he would by this time be back with
Charlotte 'if they HAVE arrived.' You think it then possible that they
really won't have returned?"

<P>His companion exhibited to view, for the idea, a sense of her responsibility;
but this was insufficient, clearly, to keep her from entertaining it. "I
think there's nothing they're not now capable of--in their so intense good
faith."

<P>"Good faith?"--he echoed the words, which had in fact something of an
odd ring, critically.

<P>"Their false position. It comes to the same thing."

<P>(377) And she bore down with her decision the superficial lack of sequence.
"They may very possibly, for a demonstration--as I see them--not have come
back."

<P>He could but wonder, at this, how she did see them. "May have bolted
somewhere together?"

<P>"May have stayed over at Matcham itself till tomorrow. May have wired
home, each of them, since Maggie left me. May have done," Fanny Assingham
continued, "God knows what!" She went on suddenly with more emotion--which,
at the pressure of some spring of her inner vision, broke out in a wail
of distress imperfectly smothered. "Whatever they've done I shall never
know. Never, never--because I don't want to and because nothing will induce
me. So they may do as they like. But I've worked for them ALL!" She uttered
this last with another irrepressible quaver, and the next moment her tears
had come, though she had, with the explosion, quitted her husband as if
to hide it from him. She passed into the dusky drawing-room where during
his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind, so that the light
of the street-lamps came in a little at the window. She made for this window,
against which she leaned her head, while the Colonel, with his lengthened
face, looked after her for a minute and hesitated. He might have been trying
to guess what she had really done, to what extent, beyond his knowledge
or his conception, in the affairs of these people, she COULD have committed
herself. But to hear her cry and yet do her best not to was quickly enough
too much for him; he had known her (378) at other times quite not make
the repressive effort, and that had n't been so bad. He went to her and
put his arm round her; he drew her head to his breast, where, while she
gasped, she let it stay a little--all with a patience that presently stilled
her. Yet the effect of this small crisis, oddly enough, was not to close
their colloquy, with the natural result of sending them to bed: what was
between them had opened out further, had somehow, through the sharp show
of her feeling, taken a positive stride, had entered, as it were, without
more words, the region of the understood, shutting the door after it and
bringing them so still more nearly face to face. They remained for some
minutes looking at it through the dim window which opened upon the world
of human trouble in general and which let the vague light play here and
there upon gilt and crystal and colour, the florid features, looming dimly,
of Fanny's drawing-room. And the beauty of what thus passed between them,
passed with her cry of pain, with her burst of tears, with his wonderment
and his kindness and his comfort, with the moments of their silence, above
all, which might have represented their sinking together, hand in hand
for a time, into the mystic lake where he had begun, as we have hinted,
by seeing her paddle alone--the beauty of it was that they now could really
talk better than before, because the basis had at last once for all defined
itself. What was the basis, which Fanny absolutely exacted, but that Charlotte
and the Prince must be saved--so far as consistently speaking of them as
still safe might save them? It did save them somehow for Fanny's troubled
mind--for that was (379) the nature of the mind of women. He conveyed to
her now, at all events, by refusing her no gentleness, that he had sufficiently
got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted. This remained quite
clear even when he presently reverted to what she had told him of her recent
passage with Maggie. "I don't altogether see, you know, what you infer
from it, or why you infer anything." When he so expressed himself it was
quite as if in possession of what they had brought up from the depths.
