<P>He had talked to her of their waiting in Paris a week later, but on
the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain. He had
written to his daughter, not indeed from Brighton, but directly after their
return to Fawns, where they spent only forty-eight hours before resuming
their journey; and Maggie's reply to his news was a telegram from Rome,
delivered to him at noon of their fourth day and which he brought out to
Charlotte, who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel, where
they had agreed he should join her for their proceeding together to the
noontide meal. His letter, at Fawns--a letter of several pages and intended
lucidly, unreservedly, in fact all but triumphantly, to inform--had proved
on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple
a document to frame as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning
had allowed him to assume: this doubtless however only for reasons naturally
latent in the very wealth of that consciousness, which contributed to his
message something of their own quality of impatience. The main result of
their talk for the time had been a difference in his relation to his young
friend, as well as a difference, equally sensible, in her relation to himself;
and this in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to "speak"
to her so far even as to tell her of the communication dispatched to Rome.
(228) Delicacy, a delicacy more beautiful still, all the delicacy she should
want, reigned between them--it being rudimentary, in their actual order,
that she must n't be further worried until Maggie should have put her at
her ease.

<P>It was just the delicacy, nevertheless, that in Paris--which, suggestively,
was Brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch--made between him and his associate
the tension, made the suspense, made what he would have consented perhaps
to call the provisional peculiarity, of present conditions. These elements
acted in a manner of their own, imposing and involving, under one head,
many abstentions and precautions, twenty anxieties and reminders--things
verily he would scarce have known how to express; and yet creating for
them at every step an acceptance of their reality. He was hanging back
with Charlotte till another person should intervene for their assistance,
and yet they had, by what had already occurred, been carried on to something
it was out of the power of other persons to make either less or greater.
Common conventions--that was what was odd--had to be on this basis more
thought of; those common conventions that, previous to the passage by the
Brighton strand, he had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking. The
explanation would have been, he supposed--or would have figured it with
less of unrest--that Paris had, in its way, deeper voices and warnings,
so that if you went at all "far" there it laid bristling traps, as they
might have been viewed, all smothered in flowers, for your going further
still. There were strange appearances in the air, and before you knew (229)
it you might be unmistakeably matching them. Since he wished therefore
to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect fairness
any game in life he might be called to, he found himself on the receipt
of Maggie's missive rejoicing with a certain inconsistency. The announcement
made her from home had, in the act, cost some biting of his pen to sundry
parts of him--his personal modesty, his imagination of her prepared state
for so quick a jump, it did n't much matter which--and yet he was more
eager than not for the drop of delay and for the quicker transitions promised
by the arrival of the imminent pair. There was after all a hint of offence
to a man of his age in being taken, as they said at the shops, on approval.
Maggie certainly would have been as far as Charlotte herself from positively
desiring this, and Charlotte on her side as far as Maggie from holding
him light as a real value. She made him fidget thus, poor girl, but from
generous rigour of conscience.

<P>These allowances of his spirit were all the same consistent with a great
gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal; for it was the end of
his seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place. The more he
had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him that they
had in truth only an ugliness. What he could have best borne, as he now
believed, would have been Charlotte's simply saying to him that she did
n't like him enough. This he would n't have enjoyed, but he would quite
have understood it and been able ruefully to submit. She DID like him enough--nothing
to contradict that had (230) come out for him; so that he was restless
for her as well as for himself. She looked at him hard a moment when he
handed her his telegram, and the look, for what he fancied a dim shy fear
in it, gave him perhaps his best moment of conviction that--as a man, so
to speak--he properly pleased her. He said nothing--the words sufficiently
did it for him, doing it again better still as Charlotte, who had left
her chair at his approach, murmured them out. "We start to-night to bring
you all our love and joy and sympathy." There they were, the words, and
what did she want more? She did n't however as she gave him back the little
unfolded leaf say they were enough--though he saw the next moment that
her silence was probably not disconnected from her having just visibly
turned pale. Her extraordinarily fine eyes, as it was his present theory
that he had always thought them, shone at him the more darkly out of this
change of colour; and she had again with it her apparent way of subjecting
herself, for explicit honesty and through her willingness to face him,
to any view he might take, all at his ease, and even to wantonness, of
the condition he produced in her. As soon as he saw how emotion kept her
soundless he knew himself deeply touched, since it proved that, little
as she professed, she had been beautifully hoping. They stood there a minute
while he took in from this sign that, yes then, certainly she liked him
enough--liked him enough to make him, old as he was ready to brand himself,
flush for the pleasure of it. The pleasure of it accordingly made him speak
first. "Do you begin a little to be satisfied?"

<P>(231) Still, oh still a little, she had to think. "We've hurried them
you see. Why so breathless a start?"

<P>"Because they want to congratulate us. They want," said Adam Verver,
"to SEE our happiness."

<P>She wondered again--and this time also, for him, as publicly as possible.
"So much as that?"

<P>"Do you think it's too much?"

<P>She continued to think plainly. "They were n't to have started for another
week."

<P>"Well, what then? Is n't our situation worth the little sacrifice? We'll
go back to Rome as soon as you like WITH them."

<P>This seemed to hold her--as he had previously seen her held, just a
trifle inscrutably, by his allusions to what they would do together on
a certain contingency. "Worth it, the little sacrifice, for whom? For us,
naturally--yes," she said. "We want to see them--for our reasons. That
is," she rather dimly smiled, "YOU do."

<P>"And you do, my dear, too!" he bravely declared.

<P>"Yes then--I do too," she after an instant ungrudgingly enough acknowledged.
"For us, however, something depends on it."

<P>"Rather! But does nothing depend on it for them?"

<P>"What CAN--from the moment that, as appears, they don't want to nip
us in the bud? I can imagine their rushing up to prevent us. But an enthusiasm
for us that can wait so very little--such intense eagerness, I confess,"
she went on, "more than a little puzzles me. You may think me," she also
added, "ungracious and suspicious, but the Prince can't at (232) all WANT
to come back so soon. He wanted quite too intensely to get away."

<P>Mr. Verver considered. "Well, hasn't he been away?"

<P>"Yes, just long enough to see how he likes it. Besides," said Charlotte,
"he may n't be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute
to Maggie. It can't in the least have appeared to him hitherto a matter
of course that you should give his wife a bouncing stepmother."

<P>Adam Verver at this looked grave. "I'm afraid then he'll just have to
accept from us whatever his wife accepts; and accept it--if he can imagine
no better reason--just because she does. That," he declared, "will have
to do for him."

<P>His tone made her for a moment meet his face; after which, "Let me,"
she abruptly said, "see it again--taking from him the folded leaf that
she had given back and he had kept in his hand. "Is n't the whole thing,"
she asked when she had read it over, "perhaps but a way like another for
their gaining time?"

<P>He again stood staring; but the next minute, with that upward spring
of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pockets which she had
already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him, he turned
sharply away and wandered from her in silence. He looked about in his small
despair he crossed the hotel court, which, overarched and glazed, muffled
against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights, heated, gilded, draped,
almost carpeted, with exotic trees in tubs, exotic ladies in (233) chairs,
the general exotic accent and presence suspended, as with wings folded
or feebly fluttering, in the superior, the supreme, the inexorably enveloping
Parisian medium, resembled some critical apartment of large capacity, some
"dental," medical, surgical waiting-room, a scene of mixed anxiety and
desire, preparatory, for gathered barbarians, to the due amputation or
extraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism. He went as far
as the porte-cochere, took counsel afresh of his usual optimism, sharpened
even somehow just here by the very air he tasted, and then came back smiling
to Charlotte. "It's incredible to you that when a man is still as much
in love as Amerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his
wife feels, to believe what she believes, to want what she wants?--in the
absence, that is, of special impediments to his so doing."

<P>The manner of it operated--she acknowledged with no great delay this
natural possibility. "No--nothing is incredible to me of people immensely
in love."

<P>"Well, is n't Amerigo immensely in love?"

<P>She hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of the degree--but
she after all adopted Mr. Verver's. "Immensely."

<P>"Then there you are!"

<P>She had another smile, however--she was n't there quite yet. "That is
n't all that's wanted."

<P>"But what more?"

<P>"Why that his wife shall have made him really believe that SHE really
believes." With which Charlotte became still more lucidly logical. "The
reality of (234) his belief will depend in such a case on the reality of
hers. The Prince may for instance now," she went on, "have made out to
his satisfaction that Maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense,
whatever it is you do. He may remember that he has never seen her do anything
else."

<P>"Well," said Adam Verver, "what kind of a warning will he have found
in that? To what catastrophe will he have observed such a disposition in
her to lead?"

<P>"Just to THIS one!" With which she struck him as rising straighter and
clearer before him than she had done even yet.

<P>"Our little question itself?" Her appearance had in fact at the moment
such an effect on him that he could answer but in marvelling mildness.
"Had n't we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe?"

<P>Her rejoinder to this WAS to wait--though by no means so long as he
meant. When at the end of her minute she spoke, however, it was mildly
too. "What would you like, dear friend, to wait for?" It lingered between
them in the air, this demand, and they exchanged for the time a look which
might have made each of them seem to have been watching in the other the
signs of its overt irony. These were indeed immediately so visible in Mr.
Verver's face that, as if a little ashamed of having so markedly produced
them--and as if also to bring out at last, under pressure, something she
had all the while been keeping back--she took a Jump to pure plain reason.
"You have n't noticed for yourself, but I can't quite help noticing, that
in spite of what you assume--WE assume, if you (235) like--Maggie wires
her joy only to you. She makes no sign of its overflow to me."

<P>It was a point--and, staring a moment, he took account of it. But he
had, as before, his presence of mind--to say nothing of his kindly humour.
"Why you complain of the very thing that's most charmingly conclusive!
She treats us already as ONE."

<P>Clearly now for the girl, in spite of lucidity and logic, there was
something in the way he said things--! She faced him in all her desire
to please him, and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it.
"I do like you, you know."

<P>Well, what could this do but stimulate his humour? "I see what's the
matter with you. You won't be quiet till you've heard from the Prince himself.
I think," the happy man added, "that I'll go and secretly wire to him that
you'd like, reply paid, a few words for yourself."

<P>It could apparently but encourage her further to smile. "Reply paid
for him, you mean--or for me?"

<P>"Oh I'll pay with pleasure anything back for you--as many words as you
like." And he went on, to keep it up. "Not requiring either to see your
message."

<P>She could take it, visibly, as he meant it. "Should you require to see
the Prince's?"

<P>"Not a bit. You can keep that also to yourself."

<P>On his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were a real
question, she appeared to consider--and almost as for good taste--that
the joke had gone far enough. "It doesn't matter. Unless he speaks of his
own movement--! And why should (236) it be," she asked, "a thing that WOULD
occur to him?"

<P>"I really think," Mr. Verver concurred, "that it naturally would n't.
HE does n't know you're morbid."

<P>She just wondered--but she agreed. "No--he has n't yet found it out.
Perhaps he will, but he has n't yet; and I'm willing to give him meanwhile
the benefit of the doubt." So with this the situation, to her view, would
appear to have cleared had n't she too quickly had one of her restless
relapses. "Maggie, however, does know I'm morbid. SHE hasn't the benefit."

<P>"Well," said Adam Verver a little wearily at last, "I think I feel that
you'll hear from her yet." It had even fairly come over him, under recurrent
suggestion, that his daughter's omission WAS surprising. And Maggie had
never in her life been wrong for more than three minutes.

<P>"Oh it is n't that I hold that I've a RIGHT to it," Charlotte the next
instant rather oddly qualified--and the observation itself gave him a further
push.

<P>"Very well--I shall like it myself."

<P>At this then, as if moved by his habit of mostly--and more or less against
his own contention--coming round to her, she showed how she could also
ever, and not less gently, come halfway. "I speak of it only as the missing
GRACE--the grace that's in everything Maggie does. It is n't my due"--she
kept it up--"but, taking from you that we may still expect it, it will
have the touch. It will be beautiful."

<P>"Then come out to breakfast." Mr. Verver had (237) looked at his watch.
"It will be here when we get back."

<P>"If it is n't"--and Charlotte smiled as she looked about for a feather
boa that she had laid down on descending from her room--"if it is n't it
will have had but THAT slight fault."

<P>He saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had moved to meet
him, and, after he had fetched it, raising it to make its charming softness
brush his face--for it was a wondrous product of Paris, purchased under
his direct auspices the day before--he held it there a minute before giving
it up. "Will you promise me then to be at peace?"

<P>She looked, while she debated, at his admirable present. "I promise
you."

<P>"Quite for ever?"

<P>"Quite for ever."

<P>"Remember," he went on, to justify his demand, "remember that in wiring
you she'll naturally speak even more for her husband than she has done
in wiring me."

<P>It was only at a word that Charlotte had a demur. "'Naturally '--?"

<P>"Why our marriage puts him for you, you see--or puts you for him--into
a new relation, whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged. It therefore
gives him more to say to you about it."

<P>"About its making me his stepmother-in-law--or whatever I SHOULD become?"
Over which for a little she not undivertedly mused. "Yes, there may easily
be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about that."

<P>(238) "Well, Amerigo can always be, according to the case, either as
funny or as serious as you like; and whichever he may be for you, in sending
you a message, he'll be it ALL." And then as the girl, with one of her
so deeply and oddly, yet so tenderly critical looks at him, failed to take
up the remark, he found himself moved, as by a vague anxiety, to add a
question. "Don't you think he's charming?"

<P>"Oh charming," said Charlotte Stant. "If he were n't I should n't mind."

<P>"No more should I!" her friend harmoniously returned.

<P>"Ah but you DON'T mind. You don't have to. You don't have to, I mean,
as I have. It's the last folly ever to care, in an anxious way, the least
particle more than one's absolutely forced. If I were you," she went on--"if
I had in my life, for happiness and power and peace, even a small fraction
of what you have, it would take a great deal to make me waste my worry.
I don't know," she said, "what in the world--that did n't touch my luck--I
should trouble my head about."

<P>"I quite understand you--yet does n't it just depend," Mr. Verver asked,
"on what you call one's luck? It's exactly my luck that I'm talking about.
I shall be as sublime as you like when you've made me all right. It's only
when one IS right that one really has the things you speak of. It is n't
they," he explained, "that make one so: it's the something else I want
that makes THEM right. If you'll give me what I ask you'll see."

<P>She had taken her boa and thrown it over her (239) shoulders, and her
eyes, while she still delayed, had turned from him, engaged by another
interest, though the court was by this time, the hour of dispersal for
luncheon, so forsaken that they would have had it, for free talk, should
they have been moved to loudness, quite to themselves. She was ready for
their adjournment, but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth in uniform,
a visible emissary of the Postes et Telegraphes, who had approached, from
the street, the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there
a missive taken from the little cartridge-box slung over his shoulder.
The portress, meeting him on the threshold, met equally, across the court,
Charlotte's marked attention to his visit, so that within the minute she
had advanced to our friends with her cap-streamers flying and her smile
of announcement as ample as her broad white apron. She raised aloft a telegraphic
message and as she delivered it sociably discriminated. "Cette fois-ci
pour madame!"--with which she as genially retreated, leaving Charlotte
in possession. Charlotte, taking it, held it at first unopened. Her eyes
had come back to her companion, who had immediately and triumphantly greeted
it. "Ah there you are!"

<P>She broke the envelope then in silence, and for a minute, as with the
message he himself had put before her, studied its contents without a sign.
He watched her without a question and at last she looked up. "I'll give
you," she simply said, "what you ask."

<P>The expression of her face was strange--but since when had a woman's
at moments of supreme surrender (240) not a right to be? He took it in
with his own long look and his grateful silence--so that nothing more for
some instants passed between them. Their understanding sealed itself--he
already felt she had made him right. But he was in presence too of the
fact that Maggie had made HER so; and always therefore without Maggie where
in fine would he be? She united them, brought them together as with the
click of a silver spring, so that on the spot, with the vision of it, his
eyes filled, Charlotte facing him meanwhile with her expression made still
stranger by the blur of his gratitude. Quite through it withal he smiled.
"What my child does for me--!"

<P>Through it all as well, that is still through the blur, he saw Charlotte,
rather than heard her, reply. She held her paper wide open, but her eyes
were wholly for his. "It is n't Maggie. It's the Prince."

<P>"I SAY!"--he gaily rang out. "Then it's best of all."

<P>"It's enough."

<P>"Thank you for thinking so!" To which he added: "It's enough for our
question, but it is n't--is it?--quite enough for our breakfast? Dejeunons."

<P>She stood there however in spite of this appeal, her document always
before them. "Don't you want to read it?"

<P>He thought. "Not if it satisfies you. I don't require it."

<P>But she gave him, as for her conscience, another chance. "You can if
you like."

<P>He hesitated afresh, but as for amiability, not for curiosity. "Is it
funny." [sic, but a question mark in 1st edition]

<P>(241) Thus, finally, she again dropped her eyes on it, drawing in her
lips a little. "No--I call it grave."

<P>"Ah then I don't want it."

<P>"Very grave," said Charlotte Stant.

<P>"Well, what did I tell you of him?" he asked, rejoicing, as they started:
a question for all answer to which, before she took his arm, the girl thrust
her paper crumpled into the pocket of her coat.
