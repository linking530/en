<P>To talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him. "Yes,
there'll be others. But you'll see me through."

<P>She hesitated. "Do you mean if you give in?"

<P>"Oh no. Through my holding out."

<P>Maggie waited again, but when she spoke it had an effect of abruptness.
"Why SHOULD you hold out for ever?

<P>He gave, none the less, no start--and this as from the habit of taking
anything, taking everything, from her as harmonious. But it was quite written
upon him too, for that matter, that holding out would n't be so very completely
his natural or at any rate his acquired form. His appearance would have
testified that he might have to do so a long time--for a man so greatly
beset. This appearance, that is, spoke but little, as yet, of short remainders
and simplified senses--and all in spite of his being a small spare slightly
stale person, deprived of the general prerogative of presence. It was n't
by mass or weight or vulgar immediate quantity that he would in the future,
any more than he had done in the past, insist or resist or prevail. There
was even something in him that made his position, on any occasion, made
his relation to any scene or to any group, a matter of the back of the
stage, of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the footlights.
He would have figured less than anything (170) the stage-manager or the
author of the play, who most occupy the foreground; he might be at the
best the financial "backer," watching his interests from the wing, but
in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry. Barely taller
than his daughter, he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of
his greater stoutness. He had lost early in life much of his crisp closely-curling
hair, the fineness of which was repeated in a small neat beard, too compact
to be called "full," though worn equally, as for a mark where other marks
were wanting, on lip and cheek and chin. His neat colourless face, provided
with the merely indispensable features, suggested immediately, for a description,
that it was CLEAR, and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent
room, clean-swept and unencumbered with furniture, but drawing a particular
advantage, as might presently be noted, from the outlook of a pair of ample
and uncurtained windows. There was something in Adam Verver's eyes that
both admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave
the modest area the outward extension of a view that was "big " even when
restricted to the stars. Deeply and changeably blue, though not romantically
large, they were yet youthfully, almost strangely beautiful, with their
ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessor's
vision out or most opened themselves to your own. Whatever you might feel,
they stamped the place with their importance, as the house-agents say;
so that on one side or the other you were never out of their range, were
moving about, for possible community, opportunity, the sight of you scarce
knew what, either

<P>(171) before them or behind them. If other importances, not to extend
the question, kept themselves down, they were in no direction less obtruded
than in that of our friend's dress, adopted once for all as with a sort
of sumptuary scruple. He wore every day of the year, whatever the occasion,
the same little black "cutaway" coat, of the fashion of his younger time;
he wore the same cool-looking trousers, chequered in black and white--the
proper harmony with which, he inveterately considered, was a white-dotted
blue satin necktie; and, over his concave little stomach, quaintly indifferent
to climates and seasons, a white duck waistcoat. "Should you really," he
now asked, "like me to marry?" He spoke as if, coming from his daughter
herself, it might be an idea; which for that matter he would be ready to
carry right straight out should she definitely say so.

<P>Definite, however, just yet, she was not prepared to be, though it seemed
to come to her with force, as she thought, that there was a truth in the
connexion to utter. "What I feel is that there's somehow something that
used to be right and that I've made wrong. It used to be right that you
had n't married and that you did n't seem to want to. It used also"--she
continued to make out--"to seem easy for the question not to come up. That's
what I've made different. It does come up. It WILL come up."

<P>"You don't think I can keep it down?" Mr. Verver's tone was cheerfully
pensive.

<P>"Well, I've given you by MY move all the trouble of having to."

<P>He liked the tenderness of her idea, and it made him, (172) as she sat
near him, pass his arm about her. "I guess I don't feel as if you had 'moved'
very far. You've only moved next door."

<P>"Well," she continued, "I don't feel as if it were fair for me just
to have given you a push and left you so. If I've made the difference for
you I must think of the difference."

<P>"Then what, darling," he indulgently asked, "DO you think?"

<P>"That's just what I don't yet know. But I must find out. We must think
together--as we've always thought. What I mean," she went on after a moment,
"is that it strikes me I ought to at least offer you some alternative.
I ought to have worked one out for you."

<P>"An alternative to what?"

<P>"Well, to your simply missing what you've lost--without anything being
done about it."

<P>"But what HAVE I lost?"

<P>She thought a minute, as if it were difficult to say, yet as if she
more and more saw it. "Well, whatever it was that BEFORE kept us from thinking,
and kept you, really, as you might say, in the market. It was as if you
could n't be in the market when you were married to ME. Or rather as if
I kept people off, innocently, by being married to you. Now that I'm married
to some one else you're, as in consequence, married to nobody. Therefore
you may be married to anybody, to everybody. People don't see why you should
n't be married to THEM."

<P>"Is n't it enough of a reason," he mildly enquired, "that I don't want
to be?"

<P>(173) "It's enough of a reason, yes. But to BE enough of a reason it
has to be too much of a trouble. I mean FOR you. It has to be too much
of a fight. You ask me what you've lost," Maggie continued to explain.
"The not having to take the trouble and to make the fight--that's what
you've lost. The advantage, the happiness of being just as you were--because
I was just as I was--that's what you miss."

<P>"So that you think," her father presently said "that I had better get
married just in order to be as I was before?"

<P>The detached tone of it--detached as if innocently to amuse her by showing
his desire to accommodate--was so far successful as to draw from her gravity
a short light laugh. "Well, what I don't want you to feel is that if you
were to I should n't understand. I SHOULD understand. That's all," said
the Princess gently.

<P>Her companion turned it pleasantly over. "You don't go so far as to
wish me to take somebody I don't like?"

<P>"Ah father," she sighed, "you know how far I go--how far I COULD go.
But I only wish that if you ever should like anybody you may never doubt
of my feeling how I've brought you to it. You'll always know that I know
it's my fault."

<P>"You mean," he went on in his contemplative way, "that it will be you
who'll take the consequences?"

<P>Maggie just considered. "I'll leave you all the good ones, but I'll
take the bad."

<P>"Well, that's handsome." He emphasised his sense of it by drawing her
closer and holding her more tenderly. "It's about all I could expect of
you. So far (174) as you've wronged me therefore we'll call it square.
I'll let you know in time if I see a prospect of your having to take it
up. But am I to understand meanwhile," he soon went on, "that, ready as
you are to see me through my collapse, you're not ready, or not SO ready,
to see me through my resistance? I've got to be a regular martyr before
you'll be inspired?"

<P>She demurred at his way of putting it. "Why if you like it, you know,
it won't BE a collapse."

<P>"Then why talk about seeing me through at all? I shall only collapse
if I do like it. But what I seem to feel is that I don't WANT to like it.
That is," he amended, "unless I feel surer I do than appears very probable.
I don't want to have to think I like it in a case when I really shan't.
I've had to do that in some cases," he confessed--"when it has been a question
of other things. I don't want," he wound up, "to be MADE to make a mistake."

<P>"Ah but it's too dreadful," she returned, "that you should even have
to FEAR--or just nervously to dream--that you may be. What does that show,
after all," she asked, "but that you do really, well within, feel a want?
What does it show but that you're truly susceptible?"

<P>"Well, it may show that"--he defended himself against nothing. "But
it shows also, I think, that charming women are, in the kind of life we're
leading now, numerous and formidable."

<P>Maggie entertained for a moment the proposition; under cover of which,
however, she passed quickly from the general to the particular. "Do you
feel Mrs. Rance to be charming?"

<P>(175) "Well, I feel her to be formidable. When they cast a spell it
comes to the same thing. I think she'd do anything."

<P>"Oh well, I'd help you," the Princess said with decision, "as against
HER--if that's all you require. It's too funny," she went on before he
again spoke, "that Mrs. Rance should be here at all. But if you talk of
the life we lead much of it's altogether, I'm bound to say, too funny.
The thing is," Maggie developed under this impression, "that I don't think
we lead, as regards other people, any life at all. We don't at any rate,
it seems to me, lead half the life we might. And so it seems, I think,
to Amerigo. So it seems also, I'm sure, to Fanny Assingham."

<P>Mr. Verver--as if from due regard for these persons--considered a little.
"What life would they like us to lead?"

<P>"Oh it's not a question, I think, on which they quite feel together.
SHE thinks, dear Fanny, that we ought to be greater."

<P>"Greater--?" He echoed it vaguely. "And Amerigo too, you say?"

<P>"Ah yes"--her reply was prompt--"but Amerigo does n't mind. He does
n't care, I mean, what we do. It's for us, he considers, to see things
exactly as we wish. Fanny herself," Maggie pursued, "thinks he's magnificent.
Magnificent, I mean, for taking everything as it is, for accepting the
'social limitations' of our life, for not missing what we don't give him."

<P>Mr. Verver attended. "Then if he does n't miss it his magnificence is
easy."

<P>(176) "It IS easy--that's exactly what I think. If there were things
he DID miss, and if in spite of them he were always sweet, then, no doubt,
he would be a more or less unappreciated hero. He COULD be a hero--he will
be one if it's ever necessary. But it will be about something better than
our dreariness. I know," the Princess declared, "where he's magnificent."
And she rested a minute on that. She ended, however, as she had begun.
"We're not, all the same, COMMITTED to anything stupid. If we ought to
be grander, as Fanny thinks, we CAN be grander. There's nothing to prevent."

<P>"Is it a strict moral obligation?" Adam Verver enquired.

<P>"No--it's for the amusement."

<P>"For whose? For Fanny's own?"

<P>"For everyone's--though I dare say Fanny's would be a large part." She
paused; she had now, it might have appeared, something more to bring out,
which she finally produced. "For yours in particular, say--if you go into
the question." She even bravely followed it up. "I have n't really, after
all, had to think much to see that much more can be done for you than is
done."

<P>Mr. Verver uttered an odd vague sound. "Don't you think a good deal's
done when you come out and talk to me this way?"

<P>"Ah," said his daughter, smiling at him, "we make too much of that!"
And then to explain: "That's good, and it's natural--but it is n't great.
We forget that we're as free as air."

<P>"Wells THAT'S great," Mr. Verver pleaded.

<P>(177) "Great if we act on it. Not if we don't."

<P>She continued to smile, and he took her smile; wondering again a little
by this time, however; struck more and more by an intensity in it that
belied a light tone. "What do you want," he demanded, "to do to me?" And
he added, as she did n't say, "You've got something in your mind." It had
come to him within the minute that from the beginning of their session
there she had been keeping something back, and that an impression of this
had more than once, in spite of his general theoretic respect for her present
right to personal reserves and mysteries, almost ceased to be vague in
him. There had been from the first something in her anxious eyes, in the
way she occasionally lost herself, that it would perfectly explain. He
was therefore now quite sure. "You've got something up your sleeve."

<P>She had a silence that made him right. "Well, when I tell you you'll
understand. It's only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter I
got this morning. All day, yes--it HAS been in my mind. I've been asking
myself if it were quite the right moment, or in any way fair, to ask YOU
if you could stand just now another woman."

<P>It relieved him a little, yet the beautiful consideration of her manner
made it in a degree portentous. "'Stand' one--?"

<P>"Well, mind her coming."

<P>He stared--then he laughed. "It depends on who she IS."

<P>"There--you see! I've at all events been thinking whether you'd take
this particular person but as a (178) worry the more. Whether, that is,
you'd go so far with her in your notion of having to be kind."

<P>He gave at this the quickest shake to his foot. "How far would she go
in HER notion of it?"

<P>"Well," his daughter returned, "you know how far, in a general way,
Charlotte Stant goes."

<P>"Charlotte? Is SHE coming?"

<P>"She writes me, practically, that she'd like to if we're so good as
to ask her."

<P>Mr. Verver continued to gaze, but rather as if waiting for more. Then
as everything appeared to have come his expression had a drop. If this
was all it was simple. "Then why in the world not?"

<P>Maggie's face lighted anew, but it was now another light. "It is n't
a want of tact?"

<P>"To ask her?"

<P>"To propose it to you."

<P>"That I should ask her?"

<P>He put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness, but this
had also its own effect. Maggie wondered an instant; after which, as with
a flush of recognition, she took it up. "It would be too beautiful if you
WOULD!"

<P>This, clearly, had not been her first idea--the chance of his words
had prompted it. "Do you mean write to her myself?"

<P>"Yes--it would be kind. It would be quite beautiful of you. That is
of course," said Maggie, "if you sincerely CAN."

<P>He appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely should n't, and indeed,
for that matter, where the question of sincerity came in. This virtue between
(179) him and his daughter's friend had surely been taken for granted.
"My dear child," he returned, "I don't think I'm afraid of Charlotte."

<P>"Well, that's just what it's lovely to have from you. From the moment
you're NOT--the least little bit--I'll immediately invite her."

<P>"But where in the world is she?" He spoke as if he had n't thought of
Charlotte, nor so much as heard her name pronounced, for a very long time.
He quite in fact amicably, almost amusedly, woke up to her.

<P>"She's in Brittany, at a little bathing-place, with some people I don't
know. She's always with people, poor dear--she rather has to be; even when,
as is sometimes the case, they're people she does n't immensely like."

<P>"Well, I guess she likes US," said Adam Verver.

<P>"Yes--fortunately she likes us. And if I was n't afraid of spoiling
it for you," Maggie added, "I'd even mention that you're not the one of
our number she likes least."

<P>"Why should that spoil it for me?"

<P>"Oh my dear, you know. What else have we been talking about? It costs
you so much to be liked. That's why I hesitated to tell you of my letter.

<P>He stared a moment--as if the subject had suddenly grown out of recognition.
"But Charlotte--on other visits--never used to cost me anything."

<P>"No--only her 'keep,"' Maggie smiled.

<P>' Then I don't think I mind her keep--if that's all."

<P>(180) The Princess, however, it was clear, wished to be thoroughly conscientious.
"Well, it may not be quite all. If I think of its being pleasant to have
her, it's because she WILL make a difference."

<P>"Well, what's the harm in that if it's but a difference for the better?"

<P>"Ah then--there you are!" And the Princess showed in her smile her small
triumphant wisdom. "If you acknowledge a possible difference for the better
we're not, after all, so tremendously right as we are. I mean we're not--as
a family--so intensely satisfied and amused. We do see there are ways of
being grander."

<P>"But will Charlotte Stant," her father asked with surprise, "make us
grander?"

<P>Maggie, on this, looking at him well, had a remarkable reply. "Yes,
I think. Really grander."

<P>He thought; for if here was a sudden opening he wished but the more
to meet it. "Because she's so handsome?"

<P>"No, father." And the Princess was almost solemn. "Because she's so
great."

<P>"'Great'--?"

<P>"Great in nature, in character, in spirit. Great in life."

<P>"So?" Mr. Verver echoed. "What has she done--in life?"

<P>"Well, she has been brave and bright," said Maggie. "That may n't sound
like much, but she has been so in the face of things that might well have
made it too difficult for many other girls. She has n't a creature in the
world really--that is nearly--belonging to (181) her. Only acquaintances
who, in all sorts of ways, make use of her, and distant relations who are
so afraid she'll make use of THEM that they seldom let her look at them."

<P>Mr. Verver was struck--and, as usual, to some purpose. "If we get her
here to improve us don't we too then make use of her?"

<P>It pulled the Princess up, however, but an instant. "We're old, old
friends--we do her good too. I should always, even at the worst--speaking
for myself--admire her still more than I used her."

<P>"I see. That always does good."

<P>Maggie seemed to consider his way of putting it. "Certainly then--she
knows it. She knows, I mean, how great I think her courage and her cleverness.
She's not afraid--not of anything; and yet she no more ever takes a liberty
with you than if she trembled for her life. And then she's INTERESTING--which
plenty of other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit." In
which fine flicker of vision the truth widened to the Princess's view.
"I myself of course don't take liberties, but then I do always by nature
tremble for my life. That's the way I live.

<P>"Oh I say, love!" her father vaguely murmured

<P>"Yes, I live in terror," she insisted. "I'm a small creeping thing."

<P>"You'll not persuade me that you're not so good as Charlotte Stant,"
he still placidly enough remarked.

<P>"I may be as good, but I'm not so great--and that's what we're talking
about. She has a great imagination. (182) She has, in every way, a great
attitude. She has above all a great conscience." More perhaps than ever
in her life before Maggie addressed her father at this moment with a shade
of the absolute in her tone. She had never come so near telling him what
he should take it from her to believe. "She has only twopence in the world--but
that has nothing to do with it. Or rather indeed"--she quickly corrected
herself--"it has everything. For she does n't care. I never saw her do
anything but laugh at her poverty. Her life has been harder than any one
knows. "

<P>It was moreover as if, thus unprecedentedly positive, his child had
an effect upon him that Mr. Verver really felt as a new thing. "Why then
have n't you told me about her before?"

<P>"Well, have n't we always known--?"

<P>"I should have thought," he submitted, "that we had already pretty well
sized her up."

<P>"Certainly--we long ago quite took her for granted. But things change
with time, and I seem to know that after this interval I'm going to like
her better than ever. I've lived more myself, I'm older, and one judges
better. Yes, I'm going to see in Charlotte," said the Princess--and speaking
now as with high and free expectation--"more than I've ever seen."

<P>"Then I'll try to do so too. She WAS"--it came back to Mr. Verver more--"the
one of your friends I thought the best for you."

<P>His companion, however, was so launched in her permitted liberty of
appreciation that she for the moment (183) scarce heard him. She was lost
in the case she made out, the vision of the different ways in which Charlotte
had distinguished herself. "She'd have liked for instance--I'm sure she'd
have liked extremely--to marry; and nothing in general is more ridiculous,
even when at has been pathetic, than a woman who has tried and has n't
been able."

<P>It had all Mr. Verver's attention. "She has 'tried'--?"

<P>"She has seen cases where she would have liked to."

<P>"But she has n't been able?"

<P>"Well, there are more cases, in Europe, in which it does n't come to
girls who are poor than in which it does come to them. Especially," said
Maggie with her continued competence, "when they're Americans."

<P>Well, her father now met her, and met her cheerfully, on all sides.
"Unless you mean," he suggested, "that when the girls are American there
are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor."

<P>She looked at him good-humouredly. "That may be--but I'm not going to
be smothered in my case. It ought to make me--if I were in danger of being
a fool--all the nicer to people like Charlotte. It's not hard for ME,"
she shrewdly explained, "not to be ridiculous--unless in a very different
way. I might easily be ridiculous, I suppose, by behaving as if I thought
I had done a great thing. Charlotte at any rate has done nothing, and any
one can see it, and see also that it's rather strange; and yet no one--no
one not awfully presumptuous or offensive--would like, (184) or would dare,
to treat her, just as she is, as anything but quite RIGHT. That's what
it is to have something about you that carries things off."

<P>Mr. Verver's silence on this could only be a sign that she had caused
her story to interest him; though the sign when he spoke was perhaps even
sharper. "And is it also what you mean by Charlotte's being 'great'?"

<P>"Well," said Maggie, "it's one of her ways. But she has many."

<P>Again for a little her father considered. "And who is it she has tried
to marry?"

<P>Maggie, on her side as well, waited as if to bring it out with effect;
but she after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle. "I'm
afraid I 'm not sure."

<P>"Then how do you know?"

<P>"Well, I don't KNOW"--and, qualifying again, she was earnestly emphatic.
"I only make it out for myself."

<P>"But you must make it out about some one in particular."

<P>She had another pause. "I don't think I want even for myself to put
names and times, to pull away any veil. I've an idea there has been, more
than once, somebody I'm not acquainted with--and need n't be or want to
be. In any case it's all over, and, beyond giving her credit for everything,
it's none of my business."

<P>Mr. Verver deferred, yet he discriminated. "I don't see how you can
give credit without knowing the facts "

<P>(185) "Can't I give it--generally--for dignity? Dignity, I mean, in
misfortune."

<P>"You've got to postulate the misfortune first."

<P>"Well," said Maggie, "I can do that. Is n't it always a misfortune to
be--when you're so fine--so wasted? And yet," she went on, "not to wail
about it, not to look even as if you knew it?"

<P>Mr. Verver seemed at first to face this as a large question, and then,
after a little, solicited by another view, to let the appeal drop. "Well,
she must n't be wasted. We won't at least have waste."

<P>It produced in Maggie's face another gratitude. "Then, dear sir, that's
all I want."

<P>And it would apparently have settled their question and ended their
talk if her father had n't, after a little, shown the disposition to revert.
"How many times are you supposing she has tried?"

<P>Once more, at this, and as if she had n't been, could n't be, hated
to be, in such delicate matters, literal, she was moved to attenuate. "Oh
I don't say she absolutely ever tried--!"

<P>He looked perplexed. "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then
has she done?"

<P>"She has suffered--she has done THAT." And the Princess added: "She
has loved--and she has lost.'

<P>Mr. Verver, however, still wondered. "But how many times?"

<P>Maggie hesitated, but it cleared up. "Once is enough. Enough, that is,
for one to be kind to her.

<P>Her father listened, yet not challenging--only as (186) with a need
of some basis on which, under these new lights, his bounty could be firm.
"But has she told you nothing?"

<P>"Ah thank goodness, no!"

<P>He stared. "Then don't young women tell?"

<P>"Because, you mean, it's just what they're supposed to do?" She looked
at him, flushed again now; with which, after another hesitation, "Do young
men tell?" she asked.

<P>He gave a short laugh. "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?"

<P>"Then how do I know, father, what vulgar girls do?"

<P>"I see--I see," he quickly returned.

<P>But she spoke the next moment as if she might, odiously, have been sharp.
"What happens at least is that where there's a great deal of pride there's
a great deal of silence. I don't know, I admit, what I should do if I were
lonely and sore--for what sorrow, to speak of, have I ever had in my life?
I don't know even if I'm proud--it seems to me the question has never come
up for me."

<P>"Oh I guess you're proud, Mag," her father cheerfully interposed. "I
mean I guess you're proud enough."

<P>"Well then I hope I'm humble enough too. I might at all events, for
all I know, be abject under a blow. How can I tell? Do you realise, father,
that I've never had the least blow?"

<P>He gave her a long quiet look. "Who SHOULD realise if I don't?"

<P>"Well. you'll realise when I HAVE one!" she exclaimed (187) with a short
laugh that resembled, as for good reasons, his own of a minute before.
"I would n't in any case have let her tell me what would have been dreadful
to me. For such wounds and shames ARE dreadful: at least," she added, catching
herself up, "I suppose they are; for what, as I say, do I know of them?
I don t WANT to know!"--she spoke quite with vehemence. "There are things
that are sacred--whether they're joys or pains. But one can always, for
safety, be kind," she kept on; "one feels when that's right."

<P>She had got up with these last words; she stood there before him with
that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of
their life together had n't closed his sense, kept sharp, year after year,
by the collation of types and signs, the comparison of fine object with
fine object, of one degree of finish, of one form of the exquisite with
another--the appearance of some slight slim draped "antique" of Vatican
or Capitoline halls, late and refined, rare as a note and immortal as a
link, set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and
yet, for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries
by their pedestal, keeping still the quality, the perfect felicity, of
the statue; the blurred absent eyes, the smoothed elegant nameless head,
the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an
image in worn relief round and round a precious vase. She had always had
odd moments of striking him, daughter of his very own though she was, as
a figure thus simplified, "generalised" in its grace, a figure with which
his human connexion was (188) fairly interrupted by some vague analogy
of turn and attitude, something shyly mythological and nymph-like. The
trick, he was n't uncomplacently aware, was mainly of his own mind; it
came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters.
And what was more to the point still, it often operated while he was quite
at the same time conscious that Maggie had been described, even in her
prettiness, as "prim"--Mrs. Rance herself had enthusiastically used the
word for her; while he remembered that when once she had been told before
him familiarly that she resembled a nun she had replied that she was delighted
to hear it and would certainly try to; while also, finally, it was present
to him that, discreetly heedless, through her long association with nobleness
in art, to the leaps and bounds of fashion, she brought her hair down very
straight and flat over her temples, in the constant manner of her mother,
who had n't been a bit mythological. Nymphs and nuns were certainly separate
types, but Mr. Verver, when he really amused himself, let consistency go.
The play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive
impressions of sense even while positively thinking. He was positively
thinking while Maggie stood there, and it led for him to yet another question--which
in its turn led to others still. "Do you regard the condition as hers then
that you spoke of a minute ago?"

<P>"The condition--?"

<P>"Why that of having loved so intensely that she's, as you say, 'beyond
everything'?"

<P>Maggie had scarcely to reflect--her answer was so (189) prompt. "Oh
no. She's beyond nothing. For she has had nothing."

<P>"I see. You must have had things to be beyond them. It's a kind of law
of perspective."

<P>Maggie did n't know about the law, but continued definite. "She's not,
for example, beyond help."

<P>"Oh well then she shall have all we can give her. I'll write to her,"
he said, "with pleasure."

<P>"Angel!" she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him.

<P>True as this might be, however, there was one thing more--he was an
angel with a human curiosity. "Has she told you she likes me much?"

<P>"Certainly she has told me--but I won't pamper you. Let it be enough
for you it has always been one of my reasons for liking HER."

<P>"Then she's indeed not beyond everything," Mr. Verver more or less humorously
observed.

<P>"Oh it is n't, thank goodness, that she's in love with you. It's not,
as I told you at first, the sort of thing for you to fear."

<P>He had spoken with cheer, but it appeared to drop before this reassurance,
as if the latter overdid his alarm, and that should be corrected. "Oh my
dear, I've always thought of her as a little girl."

<P>"Ah she's not a little girl," said the Princess.

<P>"Then I'll write to her as a brilliant woman."

<P>"It's exactly what she is."

<P>Mr. Verver had got up as he spoke, and for a little, before retracing
their steps, they stood looking at each other as if they had really arranged
something. They (190) had come out together for themselves, but it had
produced something more. What it had produced was in fact expressed by
the words with which he met his companion's last emphasis. "Well, she has
a famous friend in you, Princess."

<P>Maggie took this in--it was too plain for a protest. "Do you know what
I'm really thinking of?" she asked.

<P>He wondered, with her eyes on him--eyes of contentment at her freedom
now to talk; and he was n't such a fool, he presently showed, as not, suddenly,
to arrive at it. "Why of your finding her at last yourself a husband."

<P>"Good for YOU!" Maggie smiled. "But it will take," she added, "some
looking."

<P>"Then let me look right here with you," her father said as they walked
on.
