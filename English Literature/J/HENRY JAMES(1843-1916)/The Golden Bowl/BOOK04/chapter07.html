<P>The understanding appeared to have come to be that the Colonel and his
wife were to present themselves toward the middle of July for the "good
long visit" at Fawns on which Maggie had obtained from her father that
he should genially insist; as well as that the couple from Eaton Square
should welcome there earlier in the month, and less than a week after their
own arrival, the advent of the couple from Portland Place. "Oh we shall
give you time to breathe!" Fanny remarked, in reference to the general
prospect, with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism,
to each member of the party in turn; sustaining and bracing herself by
her emphasis, pushed even to an amiable cynicism, of the confident view
of these punctualities of the Assinghams. The ground she could best occupy,
to her sense, was that of her being moved, as in this connexion she had
always been moved, by the admitted grossness of her avidity, the way the
hospitality of the Ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease,
destitute as the Colonel had kept her, from the first, of any rustic retreat,
any leafy bower of her own, any fixed base for the stale season now at
hand. She had explained at home, she had repeatedly re-explained, the terms
of her dilemma, the real difficulty of her, or--as she now put it--of their,
position. When the pair could do nothing else, in Cadogan Place, they could
still talk of marvellous little Maggie, and of the charm, the sinister
charm, of their having (122) to hold their breath to watch her; a topic
the momentous midnight discussion at which we have been present was so
far from having exhausted. It came up, irrepressibly, at all private hours;
they had planted it there between them, and it grew, from day to day, in
a manner to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense
of fascination. Mrs. Assingham declared at such moments that in the interest
of this admirable young thing--to whom, she also declared, she had quite
"come over"--she was ready to pass with all the world else, even with the
Prince himself, the object, inconsequently, as well, of her continued,
her explicitly shameless appreciation, for a vulgar indelicate pestilential
woman, showing her true character in an abandoned old age. The Colonel's
confessed attention had been enlisted, we have seen, as never yet, under
pressure from his wife, by any guaranteed imbroglio; but this, she could
assure him she perfectly knew, was not a bit because he was sorry for her,
was touched by what she had let herself in for, but because when once they
had been opened he could n't keep his eyes from resting complacently, resting
almost intelligently, on the Princess. If he was in love with HER now,
however, so much the better; it would help them both not to wince at what
they would have to do for her. Mrs. Assingham had come back to that whenever
he groaned or grunted; she had at no beguiled moment--since Maggie's little
march WAS positively beguiling--let him lose sight of the grim necessity
awaiting them. "We shall have, as I've again and again told you, to lie
for her--to lie till we're black in the face."

<P>(123) "To lie 'for' her?" The Colonel often, at these hours, as from
a vague vision of old chivalry in a new form, wandered into apparent lapses
from lucidity.

<P>"To lie TO her, up and down, and in and out--it comes to the same thing.
It will consist just as much of lying to the others too: to the Prince
about one's belief in Dim; to Charlotte about one's belief in HER; to Mr.
Verver, dear sweet man, about one's belief in every one. So we've work
cut out--with the biggest lie, on top of all, being that we LIKE to be
there for such a purpose. We hate it unspeakably--I'm more ready to be
a coward before it, to let the whole thing, to let every one, selfishly
and pusillanimously slide, than before any social duty, any felt human
call, that has ever forced me to be decent. I speak at least for myself.
For you," she had added, "as I've given you so perfect an opportunity to
fall in love with Maggie, you'll doubtless find your account in being so
much nearer to her."

<P>"And what do you make," the Colonel could, at this, always imperturbably
enough ask, "of the account you yourself will find in being so much nearer
to the Prince; of your confirmed, if not exasperated, infatuation with
whom--to say nothing of my weak good nature about it--you give such a pretty
picture?"

<P>To the picture in question she had in fact been always able contemplatively
to return. "The difficulty of my enjoyment of that is, don't you see? that
I'm making, in my loyalty to Maggie, a sad hash of his affection for me."

<P>"You find means to call it then, this whitewashing of his crime, being
'loyal' to Maggie?"

<P>(124) "Oh about that particular crime there's always much to say. It's
always more interesting to us than any other crime--it has at least THAT
for it. But of course I call everything I have in mind at all being loyal
to Maggie. Being loyal to her is more than anything else helping her with
her father--which is what she most wants and needs."

<P>The Colonel had had it before, but he could apparently never have too
much of it. "Helping her 'with' him--?"

<P>"Helping her against him then. Against what we've already so fully talked
of--its having to be recognised between them that he doubts. That's where
my part is so plain--to see her through, to see her through to the end."
Exaltation, for the moment, always lighted Mrs. Assingham's reference to
this plainness; yet she at the same time seldom failed, the next instant,
to qualify her view of it. "When I talk of my obligation as clear I mean
that it's absolute; for just HOW, from day to day and through thick and
thin, to keep the thing up is, I grant you, another matter. There's one
way, luckily, nevertheless, in which I'm strong. I can so perfectly count
on her."

<P>The Colonel seldom failed here, as from the insidious growth of an excitement,
to wonder, to encourage. "Not to see you're lying?"

<P>"To stick to me fast, whatever she sees. If I stick to her--that is
to my own poor struggling way, under providence, of watching over them
ALL--she'll stand by me to the death. She won't give me away. For you know
she easily can."

<P>This, regularly, was the most lurid turn of their (125) road; but Bob
Assingham, with each journey, met it as for the first time. "Easily?"

<P>"She can utterly dishonour me with her father. She can let him know
that I was aware at the time of his marriage--as I had been aware at the
time of her own--of the relations that had pre-existed between his wife
and her husband."

<P>"And how can she do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement,
she's herself in ignorance of your knowledge?"

<P>It was a question that Mrs. Assingham had ever, for dealing with, a
manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect; very
much as if she was invited by it to say that about this exactly she proposed
to do her best lying. But she said, and with full lucidity, something quite
other: it could give itself a little the air still of a triumph over his
coarseness. "By acting immediately with the blind resentment with which,
in her place, ninety-nine women out of a hundred would act; and by so making
Mr. Verver in turn act with the same natural passion, the passion of ninety-nine
men out of a hundred. They've only to agree about me," the poor lady said;
"they've only to feel at one over it, feel bitterly practised upon, cheated
and injured; they've only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous,
for me to be quite irretrievably dished. Of course it's I who have been,
and who continue to be cheated--cheated by the Prince and Charlotte; but
they're not obliged to give me the benefit of that, or to give either of
us the benefit of anything. They'll be within their rights to lump us all
together as a false cruel conspiring crew and, if (126) they can find the
right facts to support them, get rid of us root and branch."

<P>This on each occasion put the matter so at the worst that repetition
even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she was compelled to see
the parts of the whole history, all its ugly consistency and its temporary
gloss, hang together. She enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger
present, of making it real, to her husband, and of his almost turning pale
when their eyes met at this possibility of their compromised state and
their shared discredit. The beauty was that, as under a touch of one of
the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard, he sounded out with the short
sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man. "Conspiring--so far as YOU
were concerned--to what end?"

<P>"Why to the obvious end of getting the Prince a wife--at Maggie's expense.
And then to that of getting Charlotte a husband at Mr. Verver's."

<P>"Of rendering friendly services, yes--which have produced, as it turns
out, complications. But from the moment you did n't do it FOR the complications,
why should n't you have rendered them?"

<P>It was extraordinary for her always, in this connexion, how, with time
given him, he fell to speaking better for her than she could, in the presence
of her clear-cut image of the "worst," speak for herself. Troubled as she
was she thus never wholly failed of her amusement by the way. "Oh is n't
what I may have meddled 'for'--so far as it can be proved I did meddle--open
to interpretation; by which I mean to Mr. Verver's and Maggie's? May n't
they see my (127) motive, in the light of that appreciation, as the wish
to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to the victimised father
and daughter?" She positively liked to keep it up. "May n't they see my
motive as the determination to serve the Prince, in any case and at any
price, first; to 'place' him comfortably; in other words to find him his
fill of money? May n't it have all the air for them of a really equivocal
sinister bargain between us--something quite unholy and louche?"

<P>It infallibly produced in the poor Colonel the echo. "'Louche,' love--?"

<P>"Why, have n't you said as much yourself?--have n't you put your finger
on that awful possibility?"

<P>She had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy being reminded
of them. "In speaking of your having always had such a 'mash'--?"

<P>"Such a mash, precisely, for the man I was to help to put so splendidly
at his ease. A motherly mash an impartial look at it would show it only
as likely to have been--but we're not talking of course about impartial
looks. We're talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid
discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid, as such people
almost always do, than those who have been wider awake all round from the
first. What I was to have got from my friend, in such a view, in exchange
for what I had been able to do for him--well, that would have been an equivalent,
of a kind best known to myself, for me shrewdly to consider." And she easily
lost herself each time in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture.
It would have been seen, it would have been heard of before, the case of
the (128) woman a man does n't want, or of whom he's tired, or for whom
he has no use but SUCH uses, and who's capable, in her infatuation, in
her passion, of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose
sight of him, lose touch of him, cease to have to do with him at all. Cela
s'est vu my dear; and stranger things still--as I need n't tell YOU! Very
good then," she wound up; "there's a perfectly possible conception of the
behaviour of your sweet wife; since, as I say, no imagination's so lively,
once it's started, as that of really agitated lambs. Lions are nothing
to them, for lions are sophisticated, are blases, are brought up from the
first to prowling and mauling. It does give us, you'll admit, something
to think about. My relief is luckily, however, in what I finally do think."

<P>He was well enough aware by this time of what she finally did think,
but he was n't without a sense again also for his amusement by the way.
It would have made him, for a spectator of these passages between the pair,
resemble not a little the artless child who hears his favourite story told
for the twentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what is next
to happen. "What of course will pull them up if they turn out to have less
imagination than you assume is the profit you can have found in furthering
Mrs. Verver's marriage. You were n't at least in love with Charlotte."

<P>"Oh," Mrs. Assingham, at this, always brought out, "my hand in that
is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable to HIM."

<P>"To Mr. Verver?"

<P>"To the Prince--by preventing her in that way (129) from taking, as
he was in danger of seeing her do, some husband with whom he would n't
be able to open, to keep open, so large an account as with his father-in-law.
I've brought her near him, kept her within his reach, as she could never
have remained either as a single woman or as the wife of a different man."

<P>"Kept her, on that sweet construction, to be his mistress?"

<P>"Kept her, on that sweet construction, to be his mistress." She brought
it out grandly--it had always so, for her own ear as well as, visibly,
for her husband's, its effect. "The facilities in the case, thanks to the
particular conditions, being so quite ideal."

<P>"Down even to the facility of your minding everything so little--from
your own point of view--as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of TWO
beautiful women."

<P>"Down even to THAT--to the monstrosity of my folly. But not," Mrs. Assingham
added, "'two' of anything. One beautiful woman--and one beautiful fortune.
That's what a creature of pure virtue exposes herself to when she suffers
her pure virtue, suffers her sympathy, her disinterestedness, her exquisite
sense for the lives of others, to carry her too far. Voila."

<P>"I see. It's the way the Ververs have you."

<P>"It's the way the Ververs 'have' me. It's in other words the way they
would be able to make such a show to each other of having me--if Maggie
were n't so divine."

<P>"She lets you off?" He never failed to insist on all this to the very
end; which was how he had become so versed in what she finally thought.
(130) "She lets me off. So that now, horrified and contrite at what I've
done, I may work to help her out. And Mr. Verver," she was fond of adding,
"lets me off too."

<P>"Then you do believe he knows?"

<P>It determined in her always there, with a significant pause, a deep
immersion in her thought. "I believe he'd let me off if he did know--so
that I might work to help HIM out. Or rather, really," she went on, "that
I might work to help Maggie. That would be his motive, that would be his
condition, in forgiving me; just as hers for me in fact, her motive and
her condition, are my acting to spare her father. But it's with Maggie
only that I'm directly concerned; nothing ever--not a breath, not a look,
I'll guarantee--shall I have, whatever happens, from Mr. Verver himself.
So it is therefore that I shall probably by the closest possible shave
escape the penalty of my crimes."

<P>"You mean being held responsible."

<P>"I mean being held responsible. My advantage will be that Maggie's such
a trump."

<P>"Such a trump that, as you say, she'll stick to you."

<P>"Stick to me, on our understanding--stick to me. For our understanding's
signed and sealed." And to brood over it again was ever for Mrs. Assingham
to break out again with exaltation. "It's a grand high compact. She has
solemnly promised."

<P>"But in words--?"

<P>"Oh yes, in words enough--since it's a matter of words. To keep up HER
lie so long as I keep up mine."

<P>"And what do you call 'her' lie?"

<P>(131) "Why the pretence that she believes me. Believes they're innocent."

<P>"She positively believes then they're guilty? She has arrived at that,
she's really content with it, in the absence of proof?"

<P>It was here each time that Fanny Assingham most faltered; but always
at last to get the matter for her own sense and with a long sigh sufficiently
straight. "It is n't a question of belief or of proof, absent or present;
it's inevitably with her a question of natural perception, of insurmountable
feeling. She irresistibly KNOWS that there's something between them. But
she has n't 'arrived' at it, as you say, at all; that's exactly what she
has n't done, what she so steadily and intensely refuses to do. She stands
off and off, so as not to arrive; she keeps out to sea and away from the
rocks, and what she most wants of me is to keep at a safe distance with
her--as I, for my own skin, only ask not to come nearer." After which,
invariably, she let him have it all. "So far from wanting proof--which
she must get, in a manner, by my siding with her--she wants DISproof, as
against herself, and has appealed to me, so extraordinarily, to side against
her. It's really magnificent when you come to think of it, the spirit of
her appeal. If I'll but cover them up brazenly ENOUGH, the others, so as
to show, round and about them, as happy as a bird, she on her side will
do what she can. If I'll keep them quiet, in a word, it will enable her
to gain time--time as against any idea of her father's--and so somehow
come out. If I'll take care of Charlotte in particular she'll take care
of the Prince; and it's beautiful and wonderful, really (132) pathetic
and exquisite, to see what she feels time may do for her."

<P>"Ah but what does she call, poor little thing, 'time'?"

<P>"Well, this summer at Fawns to begin with. She can live as yet of course
but from hand to mouth; but she has worked it out for herself, I think,
that the very danger of Fawns, superficially looked at, may practically
amount to a greater protection. THERE the lovers--if they ARE lovers!--will
have to mind. They'll feel it for themselves, unless things are too utterly
far gone with them."

<P>"And things are NOT too utterly far gone with them?"

<P>She had inevitably, poor woman, her hesitation for this, but she put
down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutely indispensable article
she would have put down her last shilling. "No."

<P>It made him always grin at her. "Is THAT a lie?"

<P>"Do you think you're worth lying to? If it were n't the truth for me,"
she added, "I would n't have accepted for Fawns. I CAN, I believe, keep
the wretches quiet."

<P>"But how--at the worst?"

<P>"Oh 'the worst'--don't talk about the worst! I can keep them quiet at
the best, I seem to feel, simply by our being there. It will work from
week to week of itself. You'll see."

<P>He was willing enough to see, but he desired to provide--! "Yet if it
does n't work?"

<P>"Ah that's talking about the worst!"

<P>Well, it might be; but what were they doing from (133) morning to night
at this crisis but talk? "Who'll keep the others?"

<P>"The others--?"

<P>"Who'll keep THEM quiet? If your couple have had a life together they
can't have had it completely without witnesses, without the help of persons,
however few, who must have some knowledge, some idea about them. They've
had to meet, secretly, protectedly, they've had to arrange; for if they
have n't met and have n't arranged and have n't thereby in some quarter
or other had to give themselves away, why are we piling it up so? Therefore
if there's evidence up and down London--"

<P>"There must be people in possession of it? Ah it is n't all," she always
remembered, "up and down London. Some of it must connect them--I mean,"
she musingly added, "it naturally WOULD--with other places, with who knows
what strange adventures, opportunities, dissimulations? But whatever there
may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot. Oh they've
known HOW--too beautifully! But nothing all the same is likely to find
its way to Maggie of itself."

<P>"Because every one who may have anything to tell, you hold, will have
been so squared?" And then inveterately, before she could say--he enjoyed
so much coming to this: "What will have squared Lady Castledean?"

<P>"The consciousness"--she had never lost her promptness--"of having no
stones to throw at any one else's windows. She has enough to do to guard
her own glass. That was what she was doing," Fanny (134) said, "that last
morning at Matcham when all of us went off and she kept the Prince and
Charlotte over. She helped them simply that she might herself be helped--if
it was n't perhaps rather, with her ridiculous Mr. Blint, that HE might
be. They put in together therefore of course that day; they got it clear--and
quite under her eyes; inasmuch as they did n't become traceable again,
as we know, till late in the evening." On this historic circumstance Mrs.
Assingham was always ready afresh to brood; but she was no less ready,
after her brooding, devoutly to add: "Only we know nothing whatever else--for
which all our stars be thanked!"

<P>The Colonel's gratitude was apt to be less marked. "What did they do
for themselves, anyway, from the moment they got that free hand to the
moment (long after dinner-time, have n't you told me?) of their turning
up at their respective homes?"

<P>"Well, it's none of your business!"

<P>"I don't speak of it as mine, but it's only too much theirs. People
are always traceable, in England, when tracings are required. Something
sooner or later happens; somebody sooner or later breaks the holy calm.
Murder will out."

<P>"Murder will--but this is n't murder. Quite the contrary perhaps! I
verily believe," she had her moments of adding, "that for the amusement
of the row you'd prefer an explosion."

<P>This however was a remark he seldom noticed; he wound up for the most
part, after a long contemplative smoke, with a transition from which no
exposed futility in it had succeeded in weaning him. "What (135) I can't
for my life make out is your idea of the old boy."

<P>"Charlotte's too inconceivably funny husband? I HAVE no idea."

<P>"I beg your pardon--you've just shown it. You never speak of him but
AS too inconceivably funny."

<P>"Well, he is," she always confessed. "That is he may be, for all I know,
too inconceivably great. But that's not an idea. It represents only my
weak necessity of feeling that he's beyond me--which is n't an idea either.
You see he may be stupid too."

<P>"Precisely--there you are."

<P>"Yet on the other hand," she always went on, "he may be sublime: sublimer
even than Maggie herself. He may in fact have already been. But we shall
never know." With which her tone betrayed perhaps a shade of soreness for
the single exemption she did n't yearningly welcome. "THAT I can see."

<P>"Oh I say--!" It came to affect the Colonel himself with a sense of
privation.

<P>"I'm not sure even that Charlotte will."

<P>"Oh my dear, what Charlotte does n't know--!"

<P>But she brooded and brooded. "I'm not sure even that the Prince will."
It seemed privation in short for them all. "They'll be mystified, confounded,
tormented. But they won't KNOW--and all their possible putting their heads
together won't make them. That," said Fanny Assingham, "will be their punishment."
And she ended, ever, when she had come so far, at the same pitch. "It will
probably also--if I get off with so little--be mine." (136) "And what,"
her husband liked to ask, "will be mine?"

<P>"Nothing--you're not worthy of any. One's punishment is in what one
feels, and what will make ours effective is that we SHALL feel." She was
splendid with her "ours"; she flared up with this prophecy. "It will be
Maggie herself who will mete it out."

<P>"Maggie--?"

<P>"SHE'LL know--about her father; everything. Everything," she repeated.
On the vision of which each time Mrs. Assingham, as with the presentiment
of an odd despair, turned away from it. "But she'll never tell us."
