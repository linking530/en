<P>There was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fell short till
they got well into the Park and he struck her as giving, unexpectedly,
the go-by to any serious search for the Principino. The way they sat down
a while in the sun was a sign of that; his dropping with her into the first
pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little, after
they were placed, as if now at last she might bring out, as between them,
something more specific. It made her but feel the more sharply how the
specific, in almost any direction, was utterly forbidden her--how the use
of it would be, for all the world, like undoing the leash of a dog eager
to follow up a scent. It would come out, the specific, where the dog would
come out; would run to earth somehow the truth--for she was believing herself
in relation to the truth!--at which she must n't so much as indirectly
point. Such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionate prudence
played over possibilities of danger, reading symptoms and betrayals into
everything she looked at and yet having to make it evident even while she
recognised them that she did n't wince. There were moments between them,
in their chairs, when he might have been watching her guard herself and
trying to think of something new that would trip her up. There were pauses
during which, with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine, she
might yet, as at some hard game over a (85) table for money, have been
defying him to fasten on her the least little complication of consciousness.
She was afterwards positively proud of the great style in which she had
kept this up; later on, at the hour's end, when they had retraced their
steps to find Amerigo and Charlotte awaiting them at the house, she was
able to say to herself that truly she had put her plan through; even though
once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation,
every minute of the time, not fall below the standard of that other hour
in the treasured past which hung there behind them like a framed picture
in a museum, a high-watermark for the history of their old fortune; the
summer evening in the park at Fawns, when, side by side under the trees
just as now, they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most
golden tone. There had been the possibility of a trap for her at present
in the very question of their taking up anew that residence; wherefore
she had n't been the first to sound it, in spite of the impression from
him of his holding off to see what she would do. She was saying to herself
in secret: "CAN we again, in this form, migrate there? Can I, for myself,
undertake it? face all the intenser keeping-up and stretching-out, indefinitely,
impossibly, that our conditions in the country, as we've established and
accepted them, would stand for?" She had positively lost herself in this
inward doubt--so much she was subsequently to remember; but remembering
then too that her companion, though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be
eager, had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in Eaton Square
after the banquet to the Castledeans.

<P>(86) Her mind had taken a long excursion, wandered far into the vision
of what a summer at Fawns, with Amerigo and Charlotte still more eminently
in presence against that higher sky, would bring forth. Was n't her father
meanwhile only pretending to talk of it? just as she was in a manner pretending
to listen? He got off it finally, at all events, for the transition it
could n't well help thrusting out at him; it had amounted exactly to an
arrest of her private excursion by the sense that he had begun to IMITATE--oh
as never yet!--the ancient tone of gold. It had verily come from him at
last, the question of whether she thought it would be VERY good--but very
good indeed--that he should leave England for a series of weeks on some
pretext with the Prince. Then it had been that she was to know her husband's
"menace" had n't really dropped, since she was face to face with the effect
of it. Ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk, had
stayed out with them and come home with them, besides making it impossible
that they should n't presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child
had been their original purpose. Maggie's uneffaced note was that it had,
at the end of five minutes more, driven them to that endeavour as to a
refuge, and caused them afterwards to rejoice, as well, that the boy's
irrepressibly importunate company, in due course secured and enjoyed, with
the extension imparted by his governess, a person expectant of consideration,
constituted a cover for any awkwardness. For that was what it had all come
to, that the dear man had spoken to her to TRY her--quite as he had been
spoken to himself by Charlotte with the same (87) fine idea. The Princess
took it in on the spot, firmly grasping it; she heard them together, her
father and his wife, dealing with the queer case. "The Prince tells me
that Maggie has a plan for your taking some foreign Journey with him, and
as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested my speaking to
you for it as the thing most likely to make you consent. So I do speak--see?--being
always so eager myself, as you know, to meet Maggie's wishes. I speak,
but without quite understanding this time what she has in her head. Why
SHOULD she of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship you off
together and remain here alone with me? The compliment's all to me, I admit,
and you must decide quite as you like. The Prince is quite ready, evidently,
to do his part--but you'll have it out with him. That is you'll have it
out with HER" Something of that kind was what, in her mind's ear, Maggie
heard--and this, after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly, was
her father s invitation to her to have it out. Well, as she could say to
herself all the rest of the day, that was what they did while they continued
to sit there in their penny chairs, that was what they HAD done as much
as they would now ever, ever, have out anything. The measure of this at
least had been given, that each would fight to the last for the protection,
for the perversion, of any real anxiety. She had confessed instantly, with
her humbugging grin, not flinching by a hair, meeting his eyes as mildly
as he met hers, she had confessed to her fancy that they might both, he
and his son-in-law, have welcomed such an escapade, since they had both
been so long so furiously domestic. (88) She had almost cocked her hat
under the inspiration of this opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited
young men, reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm-in-arm, might
encounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for the time at
least as novel. She had felt for fifty seconds, with her eyes all so sweetly
and falsely in her companion's, horribly vulgar; yet without minding it
either--such luck should she have if to be nothing worse than horribly
vulgar would see her through. "And I thought Amerigo might like it better,"
she had said, "than wandering off alone."

<P>"Do you mean that he won't go unless I take him?"

<P>She had considered here, and never in her life had she considered so
promptly and so intently. If she really put it that way her husband, challenged,
might belie the statement; so that what would THAT do but make her father
wonder, make him perhaps ask straight out, why she was exerting pressure?
She could n't of course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting
pressure; which was why she was obliged only to make answer: "Would n't
that be just what you must have out with HIM?"

<P>"Decidedly--if he makes me the proposal. But he has n't made it yet."

<P>Oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked! "Perhaps he's too
shy!"

<P>"Because you're so sure he so really wants my company?"

<P>"I think he has thought you might like it."

<P>"Well, I should--!" But with this he looked away from her, and she held
her breath to hear him (89) either ask if she wished him to address the
question to Amerigo straight, or enquire if she should be greatly disappointed
by his letting it drop. What had "settled" her, as she was privately to
call it, was that he had done neither of these things, and had thereby
markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason.
To attenuate on the other hand this appearance, and quite as if to fill
out the too large receptacle made so musingly by his abstention, he had
himself presently given her a reason--had positively spared her the effort
of asking whether he judged Charlotte not to have approved. He had taken
everything on himself--THAT was what had settled her. She had had to wait
very little more to feel with this how much he was taking. The point he
made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space, on any such scale,
between himself and his wife. He was n't so unhappy with her--far from
it, and Maggie was to hold that he had grinned back, paternally, through
his rather shielding glasses, in easy emphasis of this--as to be able to
hint that he required the relief of absence. Therefore unless it was for
the Prince himself--!

<P>"Oh I don't think it would have been for Amerigo himself. Amerigo and
I," Maggie had said, "perfectly rub on together."

<P>"Well then there we are."

<P>"I see"--and she had again with sublime blandness assented. "There we
are."

<P>"Charlotte and I too," her father had gaily proceeded, "perfectly rub
on together." With which he had appeared for a little to be making time.
"To put it only so," he had mildly and happily added--"to (90) put it only
so!" He had spoken as if he might easily put it much better, yet as if
the humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion.
He had played then either all consciously or all unconsciously into Charlotte's
hands; and the effect of this was to render trebly oppressive Maggie's
conviction of Charlotte's plan. She had done what she wanted, his wife
had--which was also what Amerigo had made her do. She had kept her test,
Maggie's test, from becoming possible, and had applied instead a test of
her own. It was exactly as if she had known her stepdaughter would fear
to be summoned to say, under the least approach to cross-examination, why
any change was desirable; and it was for our young woman herself, still
more prodigiously, as if her father had been capable of calculations to
match, of judging it important that he should n't be brought to demand
of her what was the matter with her. Why otherwise, with such an opportunity,
had n't he demanded it? Always from calculation--that was why, that was
why. He was terrified of the retort he might have invoked: "What, my dear,
if you come to that, is the matter with YOU?" When a minute later on he
had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further
to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous, at that climax verily she would
have had to be dumb to the question. "There seems a kind of charm, does
n't there? on our life--and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehow
renewed, had waked up refreshed. A kind of wicked selfish prosperity perhaps,
as if we had grabbed everything, fixed everything, down to the last lovely
object for the last glass case of (91) the last corner, left over, of my
old show. That's the only take-off, that it has made us perhaps lazy, a
wee bit languid--lying like gods together, all careless of mankind."

<P>"Do you consider that we're languid?"--that form of rejoinder she had
jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness. "Do you consider that we're
careless of mankind?--living as we do in the biggest crowd in the world
and running about always pursued and pursuing."

<P>It had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant; but
he came up again, as she might have said, smiling. "Well, I don't know.
We get nothing but the fun, do we?"

<P>"No," she had hastened to declare; "we certainly get nothing but the
fun."

<P>"We do it all," he had remarked, "so beautifully."

<P>"We do it all so beautifully." She had n't denied this for a moment.
"I see what you mean."

<P>"Well, I mean too," he had gone on, "that we have n't no doubt enough
the sense of difficulty."

<P>"Enough? Enough for what?"

<P>"Enough not to be selfish."

<P>"I don't think YOU are selfish," she had returned--and had managed not
to wail it.

<P>"I don't say it's me particularly--or that it's you or Charlotte or
Amerigo. But we're selfish together--we move as a selfish mass. You see
we want always the same thing," he had gone on--"and that holds us, that
binds us, together. We want each other," he had further explained; "only
wanting it, each time, FOR each other. That's what I call the (92) happy
spell; but it's also a little--possibly--the immorality."

<P>"'The immorality'?" she had pleasantly echoed.

<P>"Well, we're tremendously moral for ourselves--that is for each other;
and I won't pretend that I know exactly at whose particular personal expense
you and I for instance are happy. What it comes to, I dare say, is that
there's something haunting--as if it were a bit uncanny--in such a consciousness
of our general comfort and privilege. Unless indeed," he had rambled on,
"it's only I to whom, fantastically, it says so much. That's all I mean
at any rate--that it's 'sort of' soothing; as if we were sitting about
on divans, with pigtails, smoking opium and seeing visions. 'Let us then
be up and doing'--what is it Longfellow says? That seems sometimes to ring
out; like the police breaking in--into our opium-den--to give us a shake.
But the beauty of it is at the same time that we ARE doing; we're doing,
that is, after all, what we went in for. We're working it, our life, our
chance, whatever you may call it, as we saw it, as we felt it, from the
first. We HAVE worked it, and what more can you do than that? It's a good
deal for me," he had wound up, "to have made Charlotte so happy--to have
so perfectly contented her. YOU, from a good way back, were a matter of
course--I mean your being all right; so I need n't mind your knowing that
my great interest since then has rather inevitably been in making sure
of the same success, very much to your advantage as well, for Charlotte.
If we've worked our life, our idea really, as I say--if at any rate I can
sit here and say that I've worked my share of it--it has (93) not been
what you may call least by our having put Charlotte so at her ease. THAT
has been soothing, all round; that has curled up as the biggest of the
blue fumes, or whatever they are, of the opium. Don't you see what a cropper
we would have come if she HAD N'T settled down as she has?" And he had
concluded by turning to Maggie as for something she might n't really have
thought of. "You, darling, in that case, I verily believe, would have been
the one to hate it most."

<P>"To hate it--?" Maggie had invoked vagueness.

<P>"To hate our having, with our tremendous intentions, NOT brought it
off. And I dare say I should have hated it for you even more than for myself."

<P>"That's not unlikely perhaps when it was for me, after all, that you
did it."

<P>He had hesitated, but only a moment. "I never told you so."

<P>"Well, Charlotte herself soon enough told me."

<P>"But I never told HER," her father had answered.

<P>"Are you very sure?" she had presently asked.

<P>"Well, I like to think how thoroughly I was taken with her, and how
right I was, and how fortunate, to have that for my basis. I told her all
the good I thought of her."

<P>"Then that," Maggie had returned, "was precisely part of the good. I
mean it was precisely part of it that she could so beautifully understand."

<P>"Yes--understand everything."

<P>"Everything--and in particular your reasons. Her telling me--that showed
me how she had understood."

<P>(94) They were face to face again now, and she saw she had made his
colour rise; it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete
image, the enacted scene, of her passage with Charlotte, which he was actually
hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural
he should question her further. His forbearance to do so would but mark
precisely the complication of his fears. "What she does like," he finally
said, "is the way it has succeeded."

<P>"Your marriage?"

<P>"Yes--my whole idea. The way I've been justified. That's the joy I give
her. If for HER either it had failed--!" That however was n't worth talking
about; he had broken off. "You think then you could now risk Fawns?"

<P>"'Risk' it?"

<P>"Well, morally--from the point of view I was talking of; that of our
sinking deeper into sloth. Our selfishness somehow seems at its biggest
down there."

<P>Maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up. "Is
Charlotte," she had simply asked, "really ready?"

<P>"Oh if you and I and Amerigo are. Whenever one corners Charlotte," he
had developed more at his ease, "one finds that she only wants to know
what WE want. Which is what we got her for!"

<P>"What we got her for--exactly!" And so for a little, even though with
a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease, they
left it; left it till Maggie made the remark that it was all the same wonderful
her stepmother should be willing, before the (95) season was out, to exchange
so much company for so much comparative solitude.

<P>"Ah," he had then made answer, "that's because her idea, I think, this
time, is that we shall have more people, more than we've hitherto had,
in the country. Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we were
to get her for?"

<P>"Oh yes--to give us a life." Maggie had gone through the form of recalling
this, and the light of their ancient candour, shining from so far back,
had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that, with the sharpness
of the vision, she had risen to her feet. "Well, with a 'life' Fawns will
certainly do." He had remained in his place while she looked over his head;
the picture, in her vision, had suddenly swarmed. The vibration was that
of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which, with her companion,
she was travelling; but she was having to steady herself this time before
meeting his eyes. She had measured indeed the full difference between the
move to Fawns because each of them now knew the others wanted it and the
pairing-off, for a journey, of her husband and her father, which nobody
knew that either wanted. "More company" at Fawns would be effectually enough
the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at work; there was
truly no question but that she and her father must accept any array of
visitors. No one could try to marry him now. What he had just said was
a direct plea for that, and what was the plea itself but an act of submission
to Charlotte? He had, from his chair, been noting her look but he had the
next minute also risen, and then (96) it was they had reminded each other
of their having come out for the boy. Their junction with him and with
his companion successfully effected, the four had moved home more slowly
and still more vaguely; yet with a vagueness that permitted of Maggie's
reverting an instant to the larger issue. "If we have people in the country
then, as you were saying, do you know for whom my first fancy would be?
You may be amused, but it would be for the Castledeans."

<P>"I see. But why should I be amused?"

<P>"Well, I mean I am myself. I don't think I like her--and yet I like
to see her: which, as Amerigo says, is 'rum.'"

<P>"But don't you feel she's very handsome?" her father enquired.

<P>"Yes, but it is n't for that."

<P>"Then what is it for?"

<P>"Simply that she may be THERE--just there before us. It's as if she
may have a value--as if something may come of her. I don't in the least
know what, and she rather irritates me meanwhile. I don't even know, I
admit, why--but if we see her often enough I may find out."

<P>"Does it matter so very much?" her companion had asked while they moved
together.

<P>She had hesitated. "You mean because you do rather like her?"

<P>He on his side too had waited a little, but then he had taken it from
her. "Yes, I guess I do rather like her."

<P>Which she accepted for the first case she could recall of their not
being affected by a person in the same (97) way. It came back therefore
to his pretending; but she had gone far enough, and to add to her appearance
of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty
she should also immediately desire at Fawns the presence of the Assinghams.
That put everything on a basis independent of explanations; yet it was
extraordinary at the same time how much, once in the country again with
the others, she was going, as they used to say at home, to need the presence
of the good Fanny. It was the strangest thing in the world, but it was
as if Mrs. Assingham might in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness
of Charlotte. It was as if the two would balance, one against the other;
as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea of the equilibrium.
It would be like putting this friend into her scale to make weight--into
the scale with her father and herself. Amerigo and Charlotte would be in
the other; therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight.
And as this played all duskily in her mind it had received from her father,
with a sound of suddenness, a luminous contribution. "Ah rather! DO let's
have the Assinghams."

<P>"It would be to have them," she had said, "as we used so much to have
them. For a good long stay in the old way and on the old terms: 'as regular
boarders' Fanny used to call it. That is if they'll come."

<P>"As regular boarders on the old terms--that's what I should like too.
But I guess they'll come," her companion had added in a tone into which
she had read meanings. The main meaning was that he felt he was going to
require them quite as much as she (98) was. His recognition of the new
terms as different from the old, what was that practically but a confession
that something had happened, and a perception that, interested in the situation
she had helped to create, Mrs. Assingham would be by so much as this concerned
in its inevitable development? It amounted to an intimation, off his guard,
that he should be thankful for some one to turn to. If she had wished covertly
to sound him he had now in short quite given himself away, and if she had
even at the start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly was
enough. He had hold of his small grandchild as they retraced their steps,
swinging the boy's hand and not bored, as he never was, by his always bristling,
like a fat little porcupine, with shrill interrogation-points--so that,
secretly, while they went, she had wondered again if the equilibrium might
n't have been more real, might n't above all have demanded less strange
a study, had it only been on the books that Charlotte should give him a
Principino of his own. She had repossessed herself now of his other arm,
only this time she was drawing him back, gently, helplessly back to what
they had tried for the hour to get away from--just as he was consciously
drawing the child and as high Miss Bogle on her left, representing the
duties of home, was complacently drawing HER. The duties of home, when
the house in Portland Place reappeared, showed even from a distance as
vividly there before them. Amerigo and Charlotte had come in--that is Amerigo
had, Charlotte rather having come out--and the pair were perched together
in the balcony, he bareheaded, she divested of her jacket, her mantle (99)
or whatever, but crowned with a brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy
day, which Maggie immediately "spotted" as new, as insuperably original,
as worn, in characteristic generous harmony, for the first time; all evidently
to watch for the return of the absent, to be there to take them over again
as punctually as possible. They were gay, they were amused, in the pleasant
morning; they leaned across the rail and called down their greeting, lighting
up the front of the great black house with an expression that quite broke
the monotony, that might almost have shocked the decency, of Portland Place.
The group on the pavement stared up as at the peopled battlements of a
castle; even Miss Bogle, who carried her head most aloft, gaped a little,
through the interval of space, as toward truly superior beings. There could
scarce have been so much of the open mouth since the dingy waifs on Christmas
Eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies--the time when Amerigo, insatiable
for English customs, had come out with a gasped "Santissima Vergine!" to
marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve. Maggie's
individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the pair would
be at work.
