<P>A telegram in Charlotte's name arrived early--"We shall come and ask
you for tea at five if convenient to you. Am wiring for the Assinghams
to lunch." This document, into which meanings were to be read, Maggie promptly
placed before her husband, adding the remark that her father and his wife,
who would have come up the previous night or that morning, had evidently
gone to an hotel.

<P>The Prince was in his "own" room, where he often sat now alone; half
a dozen open newspapers, the _Figaro_ notably, as well as the _Times_,
were scattered about him; but with a cigar in his teeth and a visible cloud
on his brow he appeared actually to be engaged in walking to and fro. Never
yet on thus approaching him--for she had done it of late, under one necessity
or another, several times--had a particular impression so greeted her;
supremely strong, for some reason, as he turned quickly round on her entrance.
The reason was partly the look in his face--a suffusion like the flush
of fever, which brought back to her Fanny Assingham's charge, recently
uttered under that roof, of her "thinking" too impenetrably. The word had
remained with her and made her think still more; so that at first as she
stood there she felt responsible for provoking on his part an irritation
of suspense at which she had n't aimed. She had been going about him these
three months, she perfectly (338) knew, with a maintained idea--of which
she had never spoken to him; but what had at last happened was that his
way of looking at her on occasion seemed a perception of the presence not
of one idea but of fifty, variously prepared for uses with which he somehow
must reckon. She knew herself suddenly, almost strangely glad to be coming
to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than a telegram; but even
after she had stepped into his prison under her pretext, while her eyes
took in his face and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his restlessness,
she recognised the virtual identity of his condition with that aspect of
Charlotte's situation for which, early in the summer and in all the amplitude
of a great residence, she had found with so little seeking the similitude
of the locked cage. He struck her as caged, the man who could n't now without
an instant effect on her sensibility give an instinctive push to the door
she had n't completely closed behind her. He had been turning twenty ways,
for impatiences all his own, and when she was once shut in with him it
was yet again as if she had come to him in his more than monastic cell
to offer him light or food. There was a difference none the less between
his captivity and Charlotte's--the difference, as it might be, of his lurking
there by his own act and his own choice; the admission of which had indeed
virtually been in his starting at her entrance as if even this were in
its degree an interference. That was what betrayed for her practically
his fear of her fifty ideas, and what had begun after a minute to make
her wish to repudiate or explain. It was more wonderful than she could
have told; it was (339) for all the world as if she was succeeding with
him beyond her intention. She had for these instants the sense that he
exaggerated, that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in
him. She had begun, a year ago, by asking herself how she could make him
think more of her; but what was it after all he was thinking now? He kept
his eyes on her telegram; he read it more than once, easy as it was, in
spite of its conveyed deprecation, to understand; during which she found
herself almost awestruck with yearning, almost on the point of marking
somehow what she had marked in the garden at Fawns with Charlotte--that
she had truly come unarmed. She did n't bristle with intentions--she scarce
knew, as he at this juncture affected her, what had happened to the only
intention she had come with. She had nothing but her old idea, the old
one he knew; she had n't the ghost of another. Presently in fact, when
four or five minutes had elapsed, it was as if she positively had n't so
much even as that one. He gave her back her paper, asking with it if there
were anything in particular she wished him to do.

<P>She stood there with her eyes on him, doubling the telegram together
as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her breath.
Of a sudden somehow, and quite as by the action of their merely having
between them these few written words, an extraordinary fact came up. He
was with her as if he were hers, hers in a degree and on a scale, with
an intensity and an intimacy, that were a new and a strange quantity, that
were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuck and
making (340) them feel they floated. What was it that, with the rush of
this, just kept her from putting out her hands TO him, from catching at
him as in the other time, with the superficial impetus he and Charlotte
had privately conspired to impart, she had so often, her breath failing
her, known the impulse to catch at her father? She did however just yet
nothing inconsequent--though she could n't immediately have said what saved
her; and by the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing something
merely needful. "I wanted you simply to know--so that you may n't by accident
miss them. For it's the last," said Maggie.

<P>"The last?"

<P>"I take it as their good-bye." And she smiled as she could always smile.
"They come in state--to take formal leave. They do everything that's proper.
To-morrow," she said, "they go to Southampton."

<P>"If they do everything that's proper," the Prince presently asked, "why
don't they at least come to dine?"

<P>She hesitated, yet she lightly enough provided her answer. "That we
must certainly ask them. It will be easy for you. But of course they're
immensely taken--!"

<P>He wondered. "So immensely taken that they can't--that your father can't--give
you his last evening in England?"

<P>This was for Maggie more difficult to meet; yet she was still not without
her stop-gap. "That may be what they'll propose--that we shall go somewhere
together, the four of us, for a celebration--except that to round it thoroughly
off we ought also to have (341) Fanny and the Colonel. They don't WANT
them at tea, she quite sufficiently expresses; they polish them off, poor
dears, they get rid of them beforehand. They want only US together; and
if they cut us down to tea," she continued, "as they cut Fanny and the
Colonel down to luncheon, perhaps it's after all for the fancy of their
keeping their last night in London for each other."

<P>She said these things as they came to her; she was unable to keep them
back even though as she heard herself she might have been throwing everything
to the winds. But was n't that the right way--for sharing his last day
of captivity with the man one adored? It was every moment more and more
for her as if she were waiting with him in his prison--waiting with some
gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the French Revolution, in
the darkness of the Terror, used to make a feast or a high discourse of
their last poor resources. If she had broken with everything now, every
observance of all the past months, she must simply then take it so--take
it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her
head. She might have been losing her head verily in her husband's eyes--since
he did n't know all the while that the sudden freedom of her words was
but the diverted intensity of her disposition personally to seize him.
He knew as little that this was her manner--now she WAS with him--of beguiling
audaciously the supremacy of suspense. For the people of the French Revolution
assuredly there was n't suspense; the scaffold, for those she was thinking
of, was certain--whereas what Charlotte's telegram (342) announced was,
short of some incalculable error, clear liberation. Just the point however
was in its being clearer to herself than to him; her clearnesses, clearances--those
she had so all but abjectly laboured for--threatened to crowd upon her
in the form of one of the clusters of angelic heads, the peopled shafts
of light beating down through iron bars, that regale on occasion precisely
the fevered vision of those who are in chains. She was going to know, she
felt, later on--was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very
morrow, how thumpingly her heart had beaten at this foretaste of their
being left together: she should judge at leisure the surrender she was
making to the consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted.
She should judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making
so little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the others;
and indeed that she was already simplifying so much more than her husband
came out for her next in the face with which he listened. He might certainly
well be puzzled, in respect to his father-in-law and Mrs. Verver, by her
glance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening. "But it
is n't--is it?" he asked--"as if they were leaving each other?"

<P>"Oh no; it is n't as if they were leaving each other. They're only bringing
to a close--without knowing when it may open again--a time that has been,
naturally, awfully interesting to them." Yes, she could talk so of their
"time"--she was somehow sustained; she was sustained even to affirm more
intensely her present possession of her ground. "They have their reasons--many
things to think of; how (343) can one tell? But there's always also the
chance of his proposing to me that WE shall have our last hours together;
I mean that he and I shall. He may wish to take me off to dine with him
somewhere alone--and to do it in memory of old days. I mean," the Princess
went on, "the REAL old days before my grand husband was invented and, much
more, before his grand wife was: the wonderful times of his first great
interest in what he has since done, his first great plans and opportunities,
discoveries and bargains. The way we've sat together late, ever so late,
in foreign restaurants, which he used to like; the way that, in every city
in Europe, we've stayed on and on, with our elbows on the table and most
of the lights put out, to talk over things he had that day seen or heard
of or made his offer for, the things he had secured or refused or lost!
There were places he took me to--you would n't believe!--for often he could
only have left me with servants. If he should carry me off with him to-night
for old sake's sake to the Earl's Court Exhibition it will be a little--just
a very, very little--like our young adventures." After which while Amerigo
watched her, and in fact quite because of it, she had an inspiration to
which she presently yielded. If he was wondering what she would say next
she had found exactly the thing. "In that case he'll leave you Charlotte
to take care of in our absence. You'll have to carry HER off somewhere
for your last evening; unless you may prefer to spend it with her here.
I shall then see that you dine, that you have everything, quite beautifully.
You'll be able to do as you like."

<P>She could n't have been sure beforehand and really (344) had n't been;
but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her see that
he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion. Nothing
in the world of a truth had ever been so sweet to her as his look of trying
to be serious enough to make no mistake about it. She troubled him--which
had n't been at all her purpose; she mystified him--which she could n't
help and comparatively did n't mind; then it came over her that he had
after all a simplicity, very considerable, on which she had never dared
to presume. It was a discovery--not like the other discovery she had once
made, but giving out a freshness; and she recognised again in the light
of it the number of the ideas of which he thought her capable. They were
all apparently queer for him, but she had at least with the lapse of the
months created the perception that there might be something in them; whereby
he stared there, beautiful and sombre, at what she was at present providing
him with. There was something of his own in his mind to which she was sure
he referred everything for a measure and a meaning; he had never let go
of it from the evening, weeks before, when, in her room after his encounter
with the Bloomsbury cup, she had planted it there by flinging at him, on
the question of her father's view of him, her determined "Find out for
yourself!" She had been aware, during the months, that he had been trying
to find out and had been seeking above all to avoid the appearance of any
evasions of such a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence,
or with a penetration more insidious, from any other source. Nothing however
had reached him; nothing (345) he could at all conveniently reckon with
had disengaged itself for him even from the announcement, sufficiently
sudden, of the final secession of their companions. Charlotte was in pain,
Charlotte was in torment, but he himself had given her reason enough for
that; and, in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligation
to follow her husband, that personage and she, Maggie, had so shuffled
away every link between consequence and cause that the intention remained,
like some famous poetic line in a dead language, subject to varieties of
interpretation. What renewed the obscurity was her strange image of their
common offer to him, her father's and her own, of an opportunity to separate
from Mrs. Verver with the due amount of form--and all the more that he
was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on
the score of taste. Taste in him as a touchstone was now all at sea; for
who could say but that one of her fifty ideas, or perhaps forty-nine of
them, would n't be exactly that taste by itself, the taste he had always
conformed to, had no importance whatever? If meanwhile at all events he
felt her as serious, this made the greater reason for her profiting by
it as she perhaps might never be able to profit again. She was invoking
that reflexion at the very moment he brought out, in reply to her last
words, a remark which, though perfectly relevant and perfectly just affected
her at first as a high oddity. "They're doing the wisest thing, you know.
For if they were ever to go--! And he looked down at her over his cigar.

<P>If they were ever to go in short it was high time with her father's
age, Charlotte's need of initiation, (346) and the general magnitude of
the job of their getting settled and seasoned, their learning to "live
into" their queer future, it was high time they should take up their courage.
This was eminent sense, but it did n't arrest the Princess, who the next
moment had found a form for her challenge. "But shan't you then so much
as miss her a little? She's wonderful and beautiful, and I feel somehow
as if she were dying. Not really, not physically," Maggie went on--"she's
naturally so far, splendid as she is, from having done with life. But dying
for us--for you and me; and making us feel it by the very fact of there
being so much of her left."

<P>The Prince smoked hard a minute. "As you say, she's splendid, but there
is--there always will be--much of her left. Only, as you also say, for
others."

<P>"And yet I think," the Princess returned, "that it is n't as if we had
wholly done with her. How can we not always think of her? It's as if her
unhappiness had been necessary to us--as if we had needed her, at her own
cost, to build us up and start us."

<P>He took it in with consideration, but he met it with a lucid enquiry.
"Why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father's wife?"

<P>They exchanged a long look--the time that it took her to find her reply.
"Because not to--!"

<P>"Well, not to--?"

<P>"Would make me have to speak of HIM. And I can't," said Maggie, "speak
of him."

<P>"You 'can't'--?"

<P>"I can't." She said it for definite notice, not to (347) be repeated.
"There are too many things," she nevertheless added. "He's too great."

<P>The Prince looked at his cigar-tip, and then as he put back the weed:
"Too great for whom?" Upon which as she hesitated, "Not, my dear, too great
for you," he declared. "For me--oh as much as you like."

<P>"Too great for me is what I mean. I know why I think it," Maggie said.
"That's enough."

<P>He looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder; he was on
the very point, she judged, of asking her why she thought it. But her own
eyes maintained their warning, and at the end of a minute he had uttered
other words. "What's of importance is that you're his daughter. That at
least we've got. And I suppose that if I may say nothing else I may say
at least that I value it."

<P>"Oh yes, you may say that you value it. I myself make the most of it."

<P>This again he took in, letting it presently put forth for him a striking
connexion. "She ought to have KNOWN you. That's what's present to me. She
ought to have understood you better."

<P>"Better than you did?"

<P>"Yes," he gravely maintained, "better than I did. And she did n't really
know you at all. She does n't know you now."

<P>"Ah yes she does!" said Maggie.

<P>But he shook his head--he knew what he meant. "She not only does n't
understand you more than I, she understands you ever so much less. Though
even I--!"

<P>(348) "Well, even you?" Maggie pressed as he paused.

<P>"Even I, even I even yet--!" Again he paused and the silence held them.

<P>But Maggie at last broke it. "If Charlotte does n't understand me it's
because I've prevented her. I've chosen to deceive her and to lie to her."

<P>The Prince kept his eyes on her. "I know what you've chosen to do. But
I've chosen to do the same."

<P>"Yes," said Maggie after an instant--"my choice was made when I had
guessed yours. But you mean," she asked, "that she understands YOU?"

<P>"It presents small difficulty!"

<P>"Are you so sure?" Maggie went on.

<P>"Sure enough. But it does n't matter." He waited an instant; then looking
up through the fumes of his smoke, "She's stupid," he abruptly opined.

<P>"O-oh!" Maggie protested in a long wail.

<P>It had made him in fact quickly change colour. "What I mean is that
she's not, as you pronounce her, unhappy." And he recovered with this all
his logic. "Why is she unhappy if she does n't know?"

<P>"Does n't know--?" She tried to make his logic difficult.

<P>"Does n't know that YOU know."

<P>It came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three
or four things to answer. But what she said first was: "Do you think that's
all it need take?" And before he could reply, "She knows, she knows!" Maggie
proclaimed.

<P>"Well then what?"

<P>But she threw back her head, she turned impatiently (349) away from
him. "Oh I need n't tell you! She knows enough. Besides," she went on,
"she does n't believe us."

<P>It made the Prince stare a little. "Ah she asks too much!" That drew
however from his wife another moan of objection, which determined in him
a judgement. "She won't let you take her for unhappy."

<P>"Oh I know better than any one else what she won't let me take her for!"

<P>"Very well," said Amerigo, "you'll see."

<P>"I shall see wonders, I know. I've already seen them and am prepared
for them." Maggie recalled--she had memories enough. "It's terrible"--her
memories prompted her to speak. "I see it's ALWAYS terrible for women."

<P>The Prince looked down in his gravity. "Everything's terrible, cara--in
the heart of man. She's making her life," he said. "She'll make it."

<P>His wife turned back upon him; she had wandered to a table, vaguely
setting objects straight. "A little by the way then too, while she's about
it, she's making ours." At this he raised his eyes, which met her own,
and she held him while she delivered herself of something that had been
with her these last minutes. "You spoke just now of Charlotte's not having
learned from you that I 'know.' Am I to take from you then that you accept
and recognise my knowledge?"

<P>He did the enquiry all the honours--visibly weighed its importance and
weighed his response. "You think I might have been showing you that a little
more handsomely?"

<P>(350) "It is n't a question of any beauty," said Maggie; "it's only
a question of the quantity of truth."

<P>"Oh the quantity of truth!" the Prince richly though ambiguously murmured.

<P>"That's a thing by itself, yes. But there are also such things all the
same as questions of good faith."

<P>"Of course there are!" the Prince hastened to reply. After which he
brought up more slowly: "If ever a man since the beginning of time acted
in good faith--!" But he dropped it, offering it simply for that.

<P>For that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like some handful
of gold-dust thrown into the air, for that then Maggie showed herself as
deeply and strangely taking it. "I see." And she even wished this form
to be as complete as she could make it. "I see."

<P>The completeness had clearly after an instant struck him as divine.
"Ah my dear, my dear, my dear--!" It was all he could say.

<P>She was n't talking however at large. "You've kept up for so long a
silence--!"

<P>"Yes, yes, I know what I've kept up. But will you do," he asked, "still
one thing more for me?"

<P>It was as if for an instant it had with her new exposure made her turn
pale. "Is there even one thing left?"

<P>"Ah my dear, my dear, my dear!"--it had pressed again in him the fine
spring of the unspeakable.

<P>There was nothing however that the Princess herself could n't say. "I'll
do anything if you'll tell me what."

<P>(351) "Then wait." And his raised Italian hand, with its play of admonitory
fingers, had never made gesture more expressive. His voice dropped to a
tone--! "Wait," he repeated. "Wait."

<P>She understood, but it was as if she wished to have it from him. "Till
they've been here, you mean?"

<P>"Yes, till they've gone. Till they're away."

<P>She kept it up. "Till they've left the country?"

<P>She had her eyes on him for clearness; these were the conditions of
a promise--so that he put the promise practically into his response. "Till
we've ceased to see them--for as long as God may grant! Till we're really
alone."

<P>"Oh if it's only that--!" When she had drawn from him thus then, as
she could feel, the thick breath of the definite--which was the intimate,
the immediate, the familiar as she had n't had them for so long--she turned
away again, she put her hand on the knob of the door. But her hand rested
at first without a grasp; she had another effort to make, the effort of
leaving him, of which everything that had just passed between them, his
presence, irresistible, overcharged with it, doubled the difficulty. There
was something--she could n't have told what; it was as if, shut in together,
they had come too far--too far for where they were; so that the mere act
of her quitting him was like the attempt to recover the lost and gone.
She had taken in with her something that within the ten minutes, and especially
within the last three or four, had slipped away from her--which it was
vain now, was n't it? to try to appear to clutch or to pick up. That consciousness
in fact had a pang, and she balanced (352) intensely for the lingering
moment and almost with a terror of her endless power of surrender. He had
only to press, really, for her to yield inch by inch, and she fairly knew
at present, while she looked at him through her cloud, that the confession
of this precious secret sat there for him to pluck. The sensation was for
the few seconds extraordinary; her weakness, her desire, so long as she
was yet not saving herself, flowered in her face like a light or a darkness.
She sought for some word that would cover this up; she reverted to the
question of tea, speaking as if they should n't meet sooner. "Then about
five. I count on you."

<P>On him too however something had descended; as to which that exactly
gave him his chance. "Ah but I shall see you--! No?" he said, coming nearer.

<P>She had, with her hand still on the knob, her back against the door,
so that her retreat under his approach must be less than a step, and yet
she could n't for her life with the other hand have pushed him away. He
was so near now that she could touch him, taste him, smell him, kiss him,
hold him; he almost pressed upon her, and the warmth of his face--frowning,
smiling, she mightn't know which; only beautiful and strange--was bent
upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams. She closed
her eyes to it, and so the next instant, against her purpose, had put out
her hand, which had met his own and which he held. Then it was that from
behind her closed eyes the right word came. "Wait!" It was the word of
his own distress and entreaty, the word for both of them all they had lefts
their plank now on (353) the great sea. Their hands were locked, and thus
she said it again. "Wait. Wait." She kept her eyes shut, but her hand,
she knew, helped her meaning--which after a minute she was aware his own
had absorbed. He let her go--he turned away with this message, and when
she saw him again his back was presented, as he had left her, and his face
staring out of the window. She had saved herself and she got off.
