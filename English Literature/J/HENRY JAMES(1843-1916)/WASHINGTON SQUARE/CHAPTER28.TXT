  THE LETTER was a word of warning; it informed him that the doctor

had come home more impracticable than ever. She might have reflected

that Catherine would supply him with all the information he needed

on this point; but we know that Mrs. Penniman's reflections were

rarely just; and, moreover, she felt that it was not for her to depend

on what Catherine might do. I have said that her young friend took his

ease with her, and it is an illustration of the fact that he made no

answer to her letter. He took note of it amply; but he lighted his

cigar with it, and he waited, in tranquil confidence that he should

receive another. "His state of mind really freezes my blood," Mrs.

Penniman had written, alluding to her brother; and it would have

seemed that upon this statement she could hardly improve.

Nevertheless, she wrote again, expressing herself with the aid of a

different figure. "His hatred of you burns with a lurid flame- the

flame that never dies," she wrote. "But it doesn't light up the

darkness of your future. If my affection could do so, all the years of

your life would be an eternal sunshine. I can extract nothing from C.;

she is so terribly secretive, like her father. She seems to expect

to be married very soon, and has evidently made preparations in

Europe- quantities of clothing, ten pairs of shoes, etc. My dear

friend, you cannot set up in married life simply with a few pairs of

shoes, can you? Tell me what you think of this. I am intensely anxious

to see you, I have so much to say. I miss you dreadfully; the house

seems so empty without you. What is the news downtown? Is the business

extending? That dear little business. I think it's so brave of you!

Couldn't I come to your office- just for three minutes? I might pass

for a customer- is that what you call them? I might come in to buy

something- some shares or some railroad things. Tell me what you think

of that plan. I would carry a little reticule, like a woman of the

people."

  In spite of the suggestion about the reticule, Morris appeared to

think poorly of the plan, for he gave Mrs. Penniman no encouragement

whatever to visit his office, which he had already represented to

her as a place peculiarly and unnaturally difficult to find. But as

she persisted in desiring an interview- up to the last, after months

of intimate colloquy, she called these meetings "interviews"- she

agreed that they should take a walk together, and was even kind enough

to leave his office for this purpose during the hours at which

business might have been supposed to be liveliest. It was no

surprise to him, when they met at a street corner, in a region of

empty lots and undeveloped pavements (Mrs. Penniman being attired as

much as possible like a "woman of the people"), to find that, in spite

of her urgency, what she chiefly had to convey to him was the

assurance of her sympathy. Of such assurances, however, he had already

a voluminous collection, and it would not have been worth his while to

forsake a fruitful avocation merely to hear Mrs. Penniman say, for the

thousandth time, that she had made his cause her own. Morris had

something of his own to say. It was not an easy thing to bring out,

and while he turned it over, the difficulty made him acrimonious.

  "Oh yes, I know perfectly that he combines the properties of a

lump of ice and a red-hot coal," he observed. "Catherine has made it

thoroughly clear, and you have told me so till I am sick of it. You

needn't tell me again; I am perfectly satisfied. He will never give us

a Penny; I regard that as mathematically proved."

  Mrs. Penniman at this point had an inspiration.

  "Couldn't you bring a lawsuit against him?" She wondered that this

simple expedient had never occurred to her before.

  "I will bring a lawsuit against you," said Morris, "if you ask me

any more such aggravating questions. A man should know when he is

beaten," he added, in a moment. "I must give her up!"

  Mrs. Penniman received this declaration in silence, though it made

her heart beat a little. It found her by no means unprepared, for

she had accustomed herself to the thought that, if Morris should

decidedly not be able to get her brother's money, it would not do

for him to marry Catherine without it. "It would not do," was a

vague way of putting the thing; but Mrs. Penniman's natural

affection completed the idea, which, though it had not as yet been

so crudely expressed between them as in the form that Morris had

just given it, had nevertheless been implied so often, in certain easy

intervals of talk, as he sat stretching his legs in the doctor's

well-stuffed armchairs, that she had grown first to regard it with

an emotion which she flattered herself was philosophic, and then to

have a secret tenderness for it. The fact that she kept her tenderness

secret proves, of course, that she was ashamed of it; but she

managed to blink her shame by reminding herself that she was, after

all, the official protector of her niece's marriage. Her logic would

scarcely have passed muster with the doctor. In the first place,

Morris must get the money, and she would help him to it. In the

second, it was plain it would never come to him, and it would be a

grievous pity he should marry without it- a young man who might so

easily find something better. After her brother had delivered himself,

on his return from Europe, of that incisive little address that has

been quoted, Morris's cause seemed so hopeless that Mrs. Penniman

fixed her attention exclusively upon the latter branch of her

argument. If Morris had been her son, she would certainly have

sacrificed Catherine to a superior conception of his future; and to be

ready to do so, as the case stood, was therefore even a finer degree

of devotion. Nevertheless, it cheeked her breath a little to have

the sacrificial knife, as it were, suddenly thrust into her hand.

  Morris walked along a moment, and then he repeated, harshly, "I must

give her up!"

  "I think I understand you," said Mrs. Penniman, gently.

  "I certainly say it distinctly enough- brutally and vulgarly

enough."

  He was ashamed of himself, and his shame was uncomfortable; and as

he was extremely intolerant of discomfort, he felt vicious and

cruel. He wanted to abuse somebody, and he began, cautiously- for he

was always cautious- with himself.

  "Couldn't you take her down a little?" he asked.

  "Take her down?"

  "Prepare her- try and ease me off."

  Mrs. Penniman stopped, looking at him very solemnly.

  "My poor Morris, do you know how much she loves you?"

  "No, I don't. I don't want to know. I have always tried to keep from

knowing. It would be too painful."

  "She will suffer much," said Mrs. Penniman.

  "You must console her. If you are as good a friend to me as you

pretend to be, you will manage it."

  Mrs. Penniman shook her head sadly.

  "You talk of my 'pretending' to like you; but I can't pretend to

hate you. I can only tell her I think very highly of you; and how will

that console her for losing you?"

  "The doctor will help you. He will be delighted at the thing being

broken off; and as he is a knowing fellow, he will invent something to

comfort her."

  "He will invent a new torture," cried Mrs. Penniman. "Heaven deliver

her from her father's comfort! It will consist of his crowing over

her, and saying, 'I always told you so!'"

  Morris colored a most uncomfortable red.

  "If you don't console her any better than you console me, you

certainly won't be of much use. It's a damned disagreeable

necessity; I feel it extremely, and you ought to make it easy for me."

  "I will be your friend for life," Mrs. Penniman declared.

  "Be my friend now!" and Morris walked on.

  She went with him; she was almost trembling.

  "Should you like me to tell her?" she asked.

  "You mustn't tell her, but you can- you can-" And he hesitated,

trying to think what Mrs. Penniman could do. "You can explain to her

why it is. It's because I can't bring myself to step in between her

and her father- to give him the pretext he grasps at so eagerly

(it's a hideous sight!) for depriving her of her rights."

  Mrs. Penniman felt with remarkable promptitude the charm of this

formula.

  "That's so like you," she said. "It's so finely felt."

  Morris gave his stick an angry swing.

  "Oh damnation!" he exclaimed, perversely.

  Mrs. Penniman, however, was not discouraged.

  "It may turn out better than you think. Catherine is, after all,

so very peculiar." And she thought she might take it upon herself to

assure him that, whatever happened, the girl would be very quiet-

she wouldn't make a noise. They extended their walk, and while they

proceeded Mrs. Penniman took upon herself other things besides, and

ended by having assumed a considerable burden; Morris being ready

enough, as may be imagined, to put everything off upon her. But he was

not for a single instant the dupe of her blundering alacrity; he

knew that of what she promised she was competent to perform but an

insignificant fraction, and the more she professed her willingness

to serve him, the greater fool he thought her.

  "What will you do if you don't marry her?" she ventured to inquire

in the course of this conversation.

  "Something brilliant," said Morris. "Shouldn't you like me to do

something brilliant?"

  The idea gave Mrs. Penniman exceeding pleasure.

  "I shall feel sadly taken in if you don't."

  "I shall have to, to make up for this. This isn't at all

brilliant, you know."

  Mrs. Penniman mused a little, as if there might be some way of

making out that it was; but she had to give up the attempt, and, to

carry off the awkwardness of failure, she risked a new inquiry.

  "Do you mean- do you mean another marriage?"

  Morris greeted this question with a reflection which was hardly

the less impudent from being inaudible. "Surely women are more crude

than men!" And then he answered, audibly, "Never in the world!"

  Mrs. Penniman felt disappointed and snubbed, and she relieved

herself in a little vaguely sarcastic cry. He was certainly perverse.

  "I give her up, not for another woman, but for a wider career,"

Morris announced.

  This was very grand; but still Mrs. Penniman, who felt that she

had exposed herself, was faintly rancorous.

  "Do you mean never to come to see her again?" she asked, with some

sharpness.

  "Oh no, I shall come again; but what is the use of dragging it

out? I have been four times since she came back, and it's terribly

awkward work. I can't keep it up indefinitely; she oughtn't to

expect that, you know. A woman should never keep a man dangling," he

added, finely.

  "Ah, but you must have your last parting!" urged his companion, in

whose imagination the idea of last partings occupied a place

inferior in dignity only to that of first meetings.
