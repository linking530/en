  OUR STORY has hitherto moved with very short steps, but as it

approaches its termination it must take a long stride. As time went

on, it might have appeared to the doctor that his daughter's account

of her rapture with Morris Townsend, mere bravado as he had deemed it,

was in some degree justified by the sequel. Morris remained as rigidly

and unremittingly absent as if he had died of a broken heart, and

Catherine had apparently buried the memory of this fruitless episode

as deep as if it had terminated by her own choice. We know that she

had been deeply and incurably wounded, but the doctor had no means

of knowing it. He was certainly curious about it, and would have given

a good deal to discover the exact truth; but it was his punishment

that he never knew- his punishment, I mean, for the abuse of sarcasm

in his relations with his daughter. There was a good deal of effective

sarcasm in her keeping him in the dark, and the rest of the world

conspired with her, in this sense, to be sarcastic. Mrs. Penniman told

him nothing, partly because he never questioned her- he made too light

of Mrs. Penniman for that- and partly because she flattered herself

that a tormenting reserve, and a serene profession of ignorance, would

avenge her for his theory that she had meddled in the matter. He

went two or three times to see Mrs. Montgomery, but Mrs. Montgomery

had nothing to impart. She simply knew that her brother's engagement

was broken off; and now that Miss Sloper was out of danger, she

preferred not to bear witness in any way against Morris. She had

done so before- however unwillingly- because she was sorry for Miss

Sloper; but she was not sorry for Miss Sloper now- not at all sorry.

Morris had told her nothing about his relations with Miss Sloper at

the time, and he had told her nothing since. He was always away, and

he very seldom wrote to her; she believed he had gone to California.

Mrs. Almond had, in her sister's phrase, "taken up" Catherine

violently since the recent catastrophe; but, though the girl was

very grateful to her for her kindness, she revealed no secrets, and

the good lady could give the doctor no satisfaction. Even, however,

had she been able to narrate to him the private history of his

daughter's unhappy love affair, it would have given her a certain

comfort to leave him in ignorance; for Mrs. Almond was at this time

not altogether in sympathy with her brother. She had guessed for

herself that Catherine had been cruelly jilted- she knew nothing

from Mrs. Penniman, for Mrs. Penniman had not ventured to lay the

famous explanation of Morris's motives before Mrs. Almond, though

she had thought it good enough for Catherine- and she pronounced her

brother too consistently indifferent to what the poor creature must

have suffered and must still be suffering. Doctor Sloper had his

theory, and he rarely altered his theories. The marriage would have

been an abominable one, and the girl had had a blessed escape. She was

not to be pitied for that, and to pretend to condole with her would

have been to make concessions to the idea that she had ever had a

right to think of Morris.

  "I put my foot on this idea from the first, and I keep it there

now," said the doctor. "I don't see anything cruel in that; one

can't keep it there too long." To this Mrs. Almond more than once

replied that, if Catherine had got rid of her incongruous lover, she

deserved the credit of it, and that to bring herself to her father's

enlightened view of the matter must have cost her an effort that he

was bound to appreciate.

  "I am by no means sure she has got rid of him," the doctor said.

"There is not the smallest probability that, after having been as

obstinate as a mule for two years, she suddenly became amenable to

reason. It is infinitely more probable that he got rid of her."

  "All the more reason you should be gentle with her."

  "I am gentle with her. But I can't do the pathetic; I can't pump

up tears, to look graceful, over the most fortunate thing that ever

happened to her."

  "You have no sympathy," said Mrs. Almond. "That was never your

strong point. You have only to look at her to see that, right or

wrong, and whether the rupture came from herself or from him, her poor

little heart is grievously bruised."

  "Handling bruises, and even dropping tears on them, doesn't make

them any better! My business is to see she gets no more knocks, and

that I shall carefully attend to. But I don't at all recognize your

description of Catherine. She doesn't strike me in the least as a

young woman going about in search of a moral poultice. In fact, she

seems to me much better than while the fellow was hanging about. She

is perfectly comfortable and blooming; she eats and sleeps, takes

her usual exercise, and overloads herself, as usual, with finery.

She is always knitting some purse or embroidering some handkerchief,

and it seems to me she turns these articles out about as fast as ever.

She hasn't much to say; but when had she anything to say? She had

her little dance, and now she is sitting down to rest. I suspect that,

on the whole, she enjoys it."

  "She enjoys it as people enjoy getting rid of a leg that has been

crushed. The state of mind after amputation is doubtless one of

comparative repose."

  "If your leg is a metaphor for young Townsend, I can assure you he

has never been crushed. Crushed? Not he! He is alive and perfectly

intact; and that's why I am not satisfied."

  "Should you have liked to kill him?" asked Mrs. Almond.

  "Yes, very much. I think it is quite possible that it is all a

blind."

  "A blind?"

  "An arrangement between them. Il fait le mort, as they say in

France; but he is looking out of the corner of his eye. You can depend

upon it, he has not burnt his ships; he has kept one to come back

in. When I am dead, he will set sail again, and then she will marry

him."

  "It is interesting to know that you accuse your only daughter of

being the vilest of hypocrites," said Mrs. Almond.

  "I don't see what difference her being my only daughter makes. It is

better to accuse one than a dozen. But I don't accuse anyone. There is

not the smallest hypocrisy about Catherine, and I deny that she even

pretends to be miserable."

  The doctor's idea that the thing was a "blind" had its intermissions

and revivals; but it may be said, on the whole, to have increased as

he grew older; together with his impressions of Catherine's blooming

and comfortable condition. Naturally, if he had not found grounds

for viewing her as a lovelorn maiden during the year or two that

followed her great trouble, he found none at a time when she had

completely recovered her self-possession. He was obliged to

recognize the fact that, if the two young people were waiting for

him to get out of the way, they were at least waiting very

patiently. He had heard from time to time that Morris was in New York;

but he never remained there long, and, to the best of the doctor's

belief, had no communication with Catherine. He was sure they never

met, and he had reason to suspect that Morris never wrote to her.

After the letter that has been mentioned, she heard from him twice

again, at considerable intervals; but on none of these occasions did

she write herself. On the other hand, as the doctor observed, she

averted herself rigidly from the idea of marrying other people. Her

opportunities for doing so were not numerous, but they occurred

often enough to test her disposition. She refused a widower, a man

with a genial temperament, a handsome fortune, and three little

girls (he had heard that she was very fond of children, and he pointed

to his own with some confidence); and she turned a deaf ear to the

solicitations of a clever young lawyer, who, with the prospect of a

great practice, and the reputation of a most agreeable man, had had

the shrewdness, when he came to look about him for a wife, to

believe that she would suit him better than several younger and

prettier girls. Mr. Macalister, the widower, had desired to make a

marriage of reason, and had chosen Catherine for what he supposed to

be her latent matronly qualities; but John Ludlow, who was a year

the girl's junior, and spoken of always as a young man who might

have his "pick," was seriously in love with her. Catherine, however,

would never look at him; she made it plain to him that she thought

he came to see her too often. He afterward consoled himself, and

married a very different person, little Miss Sturtevant, whose

attractions were obvious to the dullest comprehension. Catherine, at

the time of these events, had left her thirtieth year well behind her,

and had quite taken her place as an old maid. Her father would have

preferred she should marry, and he once told her that he hoped she

would not be too fastidious. "I should like to see you an honest man's

wife before I die," he said. This was after John Ludlow had been

compelled to give it up, though the doctor had advised him to

persevere. The doctor exercised no further pressure, and had the

credit of not "worrying" at all over his daughter's singleness; in

fact, he worried rather more than appeared, and there were

considerable periods during which he felt sure that Morris Townsend

was hidden behind some door. "If he is not, why doesn't she marry?" he

asked himself. "Limited as her intelligence may be, she must

understand perfectly well that she is made to do the usual thing."

Catherine, however, became an admirable old maid. She formed habits,

regulated her days upon a system of her own, interested herself in

charitable institutions, asylums, hospitals, and aid societies; and

went generally, with an even and noiseless step, about the rigid

business of her life. This life had, however, a secret history as well

as a public one- if I may talk of the public history of a mature and

diffident spinster for whom publicity had always a combination of

terrors. From her own point of view the great facts of her career were

that Morris Townsend had trifled with her affection, and that her

father had broken its spring. Nothing could ever alter these facts;

they were always there, like her name, her age, her plain face.

Nothing could ever undo the wrong or cure the pain that Morris had

inflicted on her, and nothing could ever make her feel toward her

father as she felt in her younger years. There was something dead in

her life, and her duty was to try and fill the void. Catherine

recognized this duty to the utmost; she had a great disapproval of

brooding and moping. She had, of course, no faculty for quenching

memory in dissipation; but she mingled freely in the usual gaieties of

the town, and she became at last an inevitable figure at all

respectable entertainments. She was greatly liked, and as time went on

she grew to be a sort of kindly maiden aunt to the younger portion

of society. Young girls were apt to confide to her their love

affairs (which they never did to Mrs. Penniman), and young men to be

fond of her without knowing why. She developed a few harmless

eccentricities; her habits, once formed, were rather stiffly

maintained; her opinions, on all moral and social matters, were

extremely conservative; and before she was forty she was regarded as

an old-fashioned person, and an authority on customs that had passed

away. Mrs. Penniman, in comparison, was quite a girlish figure; she

grew younger as she advanced in life. She lost none of her relish

for beauty and mystery, but she had little opportunity to exercise it.

With Catherine's later wooers she failed to establish relations as

intimate as those which had given her so many interesting hours in the

society of Morris Townsend. These gentlemen had an indefinable

mistrust of her good offices, and they never talked to her about

Catherine's charms. Her ringlets, her buckles and bangles glistened

more brightly with each succeeding year, and she remained quite the

same officious and imaginative Mrs. Penniman, and the odd mixture of

impetuosity and circumspection, that we have hitherto known. As

regards one point, however, her circumspection prevailed, and she must

be given due credit for it. For upward of seventeen years she never

mentioned Morris Townsend's name to her niece. Catherine was

grateful to her, but this consistent silence, so little in accord with

her aunt's character, gave her a certain alarm, and she could never

wholly rid herself of a suspicion that Mrs. Penniman sometimes had

news of him.
