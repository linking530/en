  AS A CHILD she had promised to be tall; but when she was sixteen she

ceased to grow, and her stature, like most other points in her

composition, was not unusual. She was strong, however, and properly

made, and, fortunately, her health was excellent. It has been noted

that the doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered for

his philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suffering

person. Her appearance of health constituted her principal claim to

beauty; and her clear, fresh complexion, in which white and red were

very equally distributed, was, indeed, an excellent thing to see.

Her eye was small and quiet, her features were rather thick, her

tresses brown and smooth. A dull, plain girl she was called by

rigorous critics- a quiet, ladylike girl, by those of the more

imaginative sort; but by neither class was she very elaborately

discussed. When it had been duly impressed upon her that she was a

young lady- it was a good while before she could believe it- she

suddenly developed a lively taste for dress. A lively taste is quite

the expression to use. I feel as if I ought to write it very small,

her judgment in this matter was by no means infallible; it was

liable to confusions and embarrassments. Her great indulgence of it

was really the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest

itself; she sought to be eloquent in her garments, and to make up

for her diffidence of speech by a fine frankness of costume. But if

she expressed herself in her clothes, it is certain that people were

not to blame for not thinking her a witty person. It must be added

that, though she had the expectation of a fortune- Doctor Sloper for a

long time had been making twenty thousand dollars a year by his

profession, and laying aside the half of it- the amount of money at

her disposal was not greater than the allowance made to many poorer

girls. In those days, in New York, there were still a few altar

fires flickering in the temple of republican simplicity, and Doctor

Sloper would have been glad to see his daughter present herself,

with a classic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith. It made him

fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child of his should be

both ugly and overdressed. For himself, he was fond of the good things

of life, and he made a considerable use of them; but he had a dread of

vulgarity, and even a theory that it was increasing in the society

that surrounded him. Moreover, the standard of luxury in the United

States thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as at present,

and Catherine's clever father took the old-fashioned view of the

education of young persons. He had no particular theory on the

subject; it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of self-defense

to have a collection of theories. It simply appeared to him proper and

reasonable that a well-bred young woman should not carry half her

fortune on her back. Catherine's back was a broad one, and would

have carried a good deal; but to the weight of the paternal

displeasure she never ventured to expose it, and our heroine was

twenty years old before she treated herself, for evening wear, to a

red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe, though this was an article

which, for many years, she had coveted in secret. It made her look,

when she sported it, like a woman of thirty; but oddly enough, in

spite of her taste for fine clothes, she had not a grain of

coquetry, and her anxiety when she put them on was as to whether they,

and not she, would look well. It is a point on which history has not

been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable; it was in the

royal raiment just mentioned that she presented herself at a little

entertainment given by her aunt, Mrs. Almond. The girl was at this

time in her twenty-first year, and Mrs. Almond's party was the

beginning of something very important.

  Some three or four years before this, Doctor Sloper had moved his

household gods uptown, as they say in New York. He had been living

ever since his marriage in an edifice of red brick, with granite

copings and an enormous fanlight over the door, standing in a street

within five minutes' walk of the City Hall, which saw its best days

(from the social point of view) about 1820. After this, the tide of

fashion began to set steadily northward, as, indeed, in New York,

thanks to the narrow channel in which it flows, it is obliged to do,

and the great hum of traffic rolled farther to the right and left of

Broadway. By the time the doctor changed his residence, the murmur

of trade had become a mighty uproar, which was music in the ears of

all good citizens interested in the commercial development, as they

delighted to call it, of their fortunate isle. Doctor Sloper's

interest in this phenomenon was only indirect- though, seeing that, as

the years went on, half his patients came to be overworked men of

business, it might have been more immediate- and when most of his

neighbors' dwellings (also ornamented with granite copings and large

fanlights) had been converted into offices, warehouses, and shipping

agencies, and otherwise applied to the base uses of commerce, he

determined to look out for a quieter home. The ideal of quiet and of

genteel retirement, in 1835, was found in Washington Square, where the

doctor built himself a handsome, modern, wide-fronted house, with a

big balcony before the drawing-room windows, and a flight of white

marble steps ascending to a portal which was also faced with white

marble. This structure, and many of its neighbors, which it exactly

resembled, were supposed, forty years ago, to embody the last

results of architectural science, and they remain to this day very

solid and honorable dwellings. In front of them was the Square,

containing a considerable quantity of inexpensive vegetation, enclosed

by a wooden paling, which increased its rural and accessible

appearance; and round the corner was the more august precinct of the

Fifth Avenue, taking its origin at this point with a spacious and

confident air which already marked it for high destinies. I know not

whether it is owing to the tenderness of early associations, but

this portion of New York appears to many persons the most

delectable. It has a kind of established repose which is not of

frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long, shrill city; it has

a riper, richer, more honorable look than any of the upper

ramifications of the great longitudinal thoroughfare- the look of

having had something of a social history. It was here, as you might

have been informed on good authority, that you had come into a world

which appeared to offer a variety of sources of interest; it was

here that your grandmother lived, in venerable solitude, and dispensed

a hospitality which commended itself alike to the infant imagination

and the infant palate; it was here that you took your first walks

abroad, following the nurserymaid with unequal step, and sniffing up

the strange odor of the ailanthus trees which at that time formed

the principal umbrage of the Square, and diffused an aroma that you

were not yet critical enough to dislike as it deserved; it was here,

finally, that your first school, kept by a broad-bosomed,

broad-based old lady with a ferule, who was always having tea in a

blue cup, with a saucer that didn't match, enlarged the circle both of

your observations and your sensations. It was here, at any rate,

that my heroine spent many years of her life; which is my excuse for

this topographical parenthesis.

  Mrs. Almond lived much farther uptown, in an embryonic street,

with a high number- a region where the extension of the city began

to assume a theoretic air, where poplars grew beside the pavement

(when there was one), and mingled their shade with the steep roofs

of desultory Dutch houses, and where pigs and chickens disported

themselves in the gutter. These elements of rural picturesqueness have

now wholly departed from New York street scenery; but they were to

be found within the memory of middle-aged persons in quarters which

now would blush to be reminded of them. Catherine had a great many

cousins, and with her Aunt Almond's children, who ended by being

nine in number, she lived on terms of considerable intimacy. When

she was younger they had been rather afraid of her; she was

believed, as the phrase is, to be highly educated, and a person who

lived in the intimacy of their Aunt Penniman had something of

reflected grandeur. Mrs. Penniman, among the little Almonds, was an

object of more admiration than sympathy. Her manners were strange

and formidable, and her mourning robes- she dressed in black for

twenty years after her husband's death, and then suddenly appeared,

one morning, with pink roses in her cap- were complicated in odd,

unexpected places with buckles, bugles, and pins, which discouraged

familiarity. She took children too hard, both for good and for evil,

and had an oppressive air of expecting subtle things of them; so

that going to see her was a good deal like being taken to church and

made to sit in a front pew. It was discovered after awhile, however,

that Aunt Penniman was but an accident in Catherine's existence, and

not a part of its essence, and that when the girl came to spend a

Saturday with her cousins, she was available for follow-my-master, and

even for leapfrog. On this basis an understanding was easily arrived

at, and for several years Catherine fraternized with her young

kinsmen. I say young kinsmen, because seven of the little Almonds were

boys, and Catherine had a preference for those games which are most

conveniently played in trousers. By degrees, however, the little

Almonds' trousers began to lengthen, and the wearers to disperse and

settle themselves in life. The elder children were older than

Catherine, and the boys were sent to college or placed in counting

rooms. Of the girls, one married very punctually, and the other as

punctually became engaged. It was to celebrate this latter event

that Mrs. Almond gave the little party I have mentioned. Her

daughter was to marry a stout young stockbroker, a boy of twenty: it

was thought a very good thing.
