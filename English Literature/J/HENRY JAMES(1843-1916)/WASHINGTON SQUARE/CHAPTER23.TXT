  IF MORRIS TOWNSEND was not to be included in this journey, no more

was Mrs. Penniman, who would have been thankful for an invitation, but

who (to do her justice) bore her disappointment in a perfectly

ladylike manner. "I should enjoy seeing the works of Raphael and the

ruins- the ruins of the Pantheon," she said to Mrs. Almond, "but, on

the other hand, I shall not be sorry to be alone and at peace for

the next few months in Washington Square. I want rest; I have been

through so much in the last four months." Mrs. Almond thought it

rather cruel that her brother should not take poor Lavinia abroad; but

she easily understood that, if the purpose of his expedition was to

make Catherine forget her lover, it was not in his interest to give

his daughter this young man's best friend as a companion. "If

Lavinia had not been so foolish, she might visit the ruins of the

Pantheon," she said to herself; and she continued to regret her

sister's folly, even though the latter assured her that she had

often heard the relics in question most satisfactorily described by

Mr. Penniman. Mrs. Penniman was perfectly aware that her brother's

motive in undertaking a foreign tour was to lay a trap for Catherine's

constancy; and she imparted this conviction very frankly to her niece.

  "He thinks it will make you forget Morris," she said (she always

called the young man "Morris" now). "Out of sight, out of mind, you

know. He thinks that all the things you will see over there will drive

him out of your thoughts."

  Catherine looked greatly alarmed. "If he thinks that, I ought to

tell him beforehand."

  Mrs. Penniman shook her head. "Tell him afterward, my dear- after he

has had all the trouble and expense. That's the way to serve him." And

she added, in a softer key, that it must be delightful to think of

those who love us among the ruins of the Pantheon.

  Her father's displeasure had cost the girl, as we know, a great deal

of deep-welling sorrow- sorrow of the purest and most generous kind,

without a touch of resentment or rancor; but for the first time, after

he had dismissed with such contemptuous brevity her apology for

being a charge upon him, there was a spark of anger in her grief.

She had felt his contempt; it had scorched her; that speech about

her bad taste had made her ears burn for three days. During this

period she was less considerate; she had an idea- a rather vague

one, but it was agreeable to her sense of injury- that now she was

absolved from penance, and might do what she chose. She chose to write

to Morris Townsend to meet her in the Square and take her to walk

about the town. If she were going to Europe out of respect to her

father, she might at least give herself this satisfaction. She felt in

every way at present more free and more resolute; there was a force

that urged her. Now at last, completely and unreservedly, her

passion possessed her.

  Morris met her at last, and they took a long walk. She told him

immediately what had happened; that her father wished to take her

away- it would be for six months- to Europe; she would do absolutely

what Morris should think best. She hoped inexpressibly that he would

think it best she should stay at home. It was some time before he said

what he thought; he asked, as they walked along, a great many

questions. There was one that especially struck her; it seemed so

incongruous.

  "Should you like to see all those celebrated things over there?"

  "Oh no, Morris!" said Catherine, quite deprecatingly.

  "Gracious heaven, what a dull woman!" Morris exclaimed to himself.

  "He thinks I will forget you," said Catherine, "that all these

things will drive you out of my mind."

  "Well, my dear, perhaps they will."

  "Please don't say that," Catherine answered, gently, as they

walked along. "Poor Father will be disappointed."

  Morris gave a little laugh. "Yes, I verily believe that your poor

father will be disappointed. But you will have seen Europe," he added,

humorously. "What a take in!"

  "I don't care for seeing Europe," Catherine said.

  "You ought to care, my dear; and it may mollify your father."

  Catherine, conscious of her obstinacy, expected little of this,

and could not rid herself of the idea that in going abroad and yet

remaining firm, she should play her father a trick. "Don't you think

it would be a kind of deception?" she asked.

  "Doesn't he want to deceive you?" cried Morris. "It will serve him

right. I really think you had better go."

  "And not be married for so long?"

  "Be married when you come back. You can buy your wedding clothes

in Paris." And then Morris, with great kindness of tone, explained his

view of the matter. It would be a good thing that she should go; it

would put them completely in the right. It would show they were

reasonable, and willing to wait. Once they were so sure of each other,

they could afford to wait- what had they to fear? If there was a

particle of chance that her father would be favorably affected by

her going, that ought to settle it; for, after all, Morris was very

unwilling to be the cause of her being disinherited. It was not for

himself, it was for her and for her children. He was willing to wait

for her; it would be hard, but he could do it. And over there, among

beautiful scenes and noble monuments, perhaps the old gentleman

would be softened; such things were supposed to exert a humanizing

influence. He might be touched by her gentleness, her patience, her

willingness to make any sacrifice but that one; and if she should

appeal to him someday, in some celebrated spot- in Italy, say, in

the evening; in Venice, in a gondola, by moonlight- if she should be a

little clever about it, and touch the right chord, perhaps he would

fold her in his arms, and tell her that he forgave her. Catherine

was immensely struck with this conception of the affair, which

seemed eminently worthy of her lover's brilliant intellect, though she

viewed it askance in so far as it depended upon her own powers of

execution. The idea of being "clever" in a gondola by moonlight

appeared to her to involve elements of which her grasp was not active.

But it was settled between them that she should tell her father that

she was ready to follow him obediently anywhere, making the mental

reservation that she loved Morris Townsend more than ever.

  She informed the doctor she was ready to embark, and he made rapid

arrangements for this event. Catherine had many farewells to make, but

with only two of them are we actively concerned. Mrs. Penniman took

a discriminating view of her niece's journey; it seemed to her very

proper that Mr. Townsend's destined bride should wish to embellish her

mind by a foreign tour.

  "You leave him in good hands," she said, pressing her lips to

Catherine's forehead. (She was very fond of kissing people's

foreheads; it was an involuntary expression of sympathy with the

intellectual part.) "I shall see him often; I shall feel like one of

the vestals of old tending the sacred flame."

  "You behave beautifully about not going with us," Catherine

answered, not presuming to examine this analogy.

  "It is my pride that keeps me up," said Mrs. Penniman, tapping the

body of her dress, which always gave forth a sort of metallic ring.

  Catherine's parting with her lover was short, and few words were

exchanged.

  "Shall I find you just the same when I come back?" she asked; though

the question was not the fruit of skepticism.

  "The same- only more so," said Morris, smiling.

  It does not enter into our scheme to narrate in detail Doctor

Sloper's proceedings in the Eastern Hemisphere. He made the grand tour

of Europe, traveled in considerable splendor, and (as was to have been

expected in a man of his high cultivation) found so much in art and

antiquity to interest him, that he remained abroad, not for six

months, but for twelve. Mrs. Penniman, in Washington Square,

accommodated herself to his absence. She enjoyed her uncontested

dominion in the empty house, and flattered herself that she made it

more attractive to their friends than when her brother was at home. To

Morris Townsend, at least, it would have appeared that she made it

singularly attractive. He was altogether her most frequent visitor,

and Mrs. Penniman was very fond of asking him to tea. He had his

chair- a very easy one- at the fireside in the back parlor (when the

great mahogany sliding doors, with silver knobs and hinges, which

divided this apartment from its more formal neighbor, were closed),

and he used to smoke cigars in the doctor's study, where he often

spent an hour in turning over the curious collections of its absent

proprietor. He thought Mrs. Penniman a goose, as we know; but he was

no goose himself, and, as a young man of luxurious tastes and scanty

resources, he found the house a perfect castle of indolence. It became

for him a club with a single member. Mrs. Penniman saw much less of

her sister than while the doctor was at home; for Mrs. Almond had felt

moved to tell her that she disapproved of her relations with Mr.

Townsend. She had no business to be so friendly to a young man of whom

their brother thought so meanly, and Mrs. Almond was surprised at

her levity in foisting a most deplorable engagement upon Catherine.

  "Deplorable!" cried Lavinia. "He will make her a lovely husband."

  "I don't believe in lovely husbands," said Mrs. Almond. "I only

believe in good ones. If he marries her, and she comes into Austin's

money, they may get on. He will be an idle, amiable, selfish, and,

doubtless, tolerably good-natured fellow. But if she doesn't get the

money, and he finds himself tied to her, heaven have mercy on her!

He will have none. He will hate her for his disappointment, and take

his revenge; he will be pitiless and cruel. Woe betide poor Catherine!

I recommend you to talk a little with his sister; it's a pity

Catherine can't marry her!"

  Mrs. Penniman had no appetite whatever for conversation with Mrs.

Montgomery, whose acquaintance she made no trouble to cultivate; and

the effect of this alarming forecast of her niece's destiny was to

make her think it indeed a thousand pities that Mr. Townsend's

generous nature should be embittered. Bright enjoyment was his natural

element, and how could he be comfortable if there should prove to be

nothing to enjoy? It became a fixed idea with Mrs. Penniman that he

should yet enjoy her brother's fortune, on which she had acuteness

enough to perceive that her own claim was small.

  "If he doesn't leave it to Catherine, it certainly won't be to leave

it to me," she said.
