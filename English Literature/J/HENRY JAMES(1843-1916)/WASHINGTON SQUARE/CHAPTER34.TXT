  IT WAS HER HABIT to remain in town very late in the summer; she

preferred the house in Washington Square to any other habitation

whatever, and it was under protest that she used to go to the

seaside for the month of August. At the sea she spent her month at

an hotel. The year that her father died she intermitted this custom

altogether, not thinking it consistent with deep mourning; and the

year after that she put off her departure till so late that the middle

of August found her still in the heated solitude of Washington Square.

Mrs. Penniman, who was fond of a change, was usually eager for a visit

to the country; but this year she appeared quite content with such

rural impressions as she could gather at the parlor window from the

ailanthus trees behind the wooden paling. The peculiar fragrance of

this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the evening air, and Mrs.

Penniman, on the warm nights of July, often sat at the open window and

inhaled it. This was a happy moment for Mrs. Penniman; after the death

of her brother she felt more free to obey her impulses. A vague

oppression had disappeared from her life, and she enjoyed a sense of

freedom of which she had not been conscious since the memorable

time, so long ago, when the doctor went abroad with Catherine and left

her at home to entertain Morris Townsend. The year that had elapsed

since her brother's death reminded her of that happy time, because,

although Catherine, in growing older, had become a person to be

reckoned with, yet her society was a very different thing, as Mrs.

Penniman said, from that of a tank of cold water. The elder lady

hardly knew what use to make of this larger margin of her life; she

sat and looked at it very much as she had often sat, with her poised

needle in her hand, before her tapestry frame. She had a confident

hope, however, that her rich impulses, her talent for embroidery,

would still find their application, and this confidence was

justified before many months had elapsed.

  Catherine continued to live in her father's house, in spite of its

being represented to her that a maiden lady of quiet habits might find

a more convenient abode in one of the smaller dwellings, with

brownstone fronts, which had at this time begun to adorn the

transverse thoroughfares in the upper part of the town. She liked

the earlier structure- it had begun by this time to be called an "old"

house- and proposed to herself to end her days in it. If it was to

large for a pair of unpretending gentlewomen, this was better than the

opposite fault; for Catherine had no desire to find herself in

closer quarters with her aunt. She expected to spend the rest of her

life in Washington Square, and to enjoy Mrs. Penniman's society for

the whole of this period; as she had a conviction that, long as she

might live, her aunt would live at least as long, and always retain

her brilliancy and activity. Mrs. Penniman suggested to her the idea

of a rich vitality.

  On one of those warm evenings in July of which mention has been

made, the two ladies sat together at an open window, looking out on

the quiet Square. It was too hot for lighted lamps, for reading, or

for work; it might have appeared too hot even for conversation, Mrs.

Penniman having long been speechless. She sat forward in the window,

half on the balcony, humming a little song. Catherine was within the

room, in a low rocking chair, dressed in white, and slowly using a

large palmetto fan. It was in this way, at this season, that the

aunt and niece, after they had had tea, habitually spent their

evenings.

  "Catherine," said Mrs. Penniman at last, "I am going to say

something that will surprise you."

  "Pray do," Catherine answered. "I like surprises. And it is so quiet

now."

  "Well, then, I have seen Morris Townsend."

  If Catherine was surprised, she checked the expression of it; she

gave neither a start nor an exclamation. She remained, indeed, for

some moments intensely still, and this may very well have been a

symptom of emotion. "I hope he was well," she said at last.

  "I don't know; he is a great deal changed. He would like very much

to see you."

  "I would rather not see him," said Catherine, quickly.

  "I was afraid you would say that. But you don't seem surprised!"

  "I am- very much."

  "I met him at Marian's," said Mrs. Penniman. "He goes to Marian's,

and they are so afraid you will meet him there. It's my belief that

that's why he goes. He wants so much to see you." Catherine made no

response to this, and Mrs. Penniman went on. "I didn't know him at

first, he is so remarkably changed; but he knew me in a minute. He

says I am not in the least changed. You know how polite he always was.

He was coming away when I came, and we walked a little distance

together. He is still very handsome, only of course he looks older,

and he is not so- so animated as he used to be. There was a touch of

sadness about him; but there was a touch of sadness about him

before, especially when he went away. I am afraid he has not been very

successful- that he has never got thoroughly established. I don't

suppose he is sufficiently plodding and that, after all, is what

succeeds in this world." Mrs. Penniman had not mentioned Morris

Townsend's name to her niece for upwards of the fifth of a century;

but now that she had broken the spell, she seemed to wish to make up

for lost time, as if there had been a sort of exhilaration in

hearing herself talk of him. She proceeded, however, with considerable

caution, pausing occasionally to let Catherine give some sign.

Catherine gave no other sign than to stop the rocking of her chair and

the swaying of her fan; she sat motionless and silent. "It was on

Tuesday last," said Mrs. Penniman, "and I have been hesitating ever

since about telling you. I didn't know how you might like it. At

last I thought that it was so long ago that you would probably not

have any particular feeling. I saw him again after meeting him at

Marian's. I met him in the street, and he went a few steps with me.

The first thing he said was about you; he asked ever so many

questions. Marian didn't want me to speak to you; she didn't want

you to know that they receive him. I told him I was sure that after

all these years you couldn't have any feeling about that; you couldn't

grudge him the hospitality of his own cousin's house. I said you would

be bitter indeed if you did that. Marian has the most extraordinary

ideas about what happened between you; she seems to think he behaved

in some very unusual manner. I took the liberty of reminding her of

the real facts, and placing the story in its true light. He has no

bitterness, Catherine, I can assure you; and he might be excused for

it, for things have not gone well with him. He has been all over the

world, and tried to establish himself everywhere; but his evil star

was against him. It is most interesting to hear him talk of his evil

star. Everything failed; everything but his- you know, you remember-

his proud, high spirit. I believe he married some lady somewhere in

Europe. You know they marry in such a peculiar matter-of-course way in

Europe; a marriage of reason they call it. She died soon afterward; as

he said to me, she only flitted across his life. He has not been in

New York for ten years; he came back a few days ago. The first thing

he did was to ask me about you. He had heard you had never married; he

seemed very much interested about that. He said you had been the

real romance of his life."

  Catherine had suffered her companion to proceed from point to point,

and pause to pause, without interrupting her; she fixed her eyes on

the ground and listened. But the last phrase I have quoted was

followed by a pause of peculiar significance, and then, at last,

Catherine spoke. It will be observed that before doing so she had

received a good deal of information about Morris Townsend. "Please say

no more; please don't follow up that subject."

  "Doesn't it interest you?" asked Mrs. Penniman, with a certain

timorous archness.

  "It pains me," said Catherine.

  "I was afraid you would say that. But don't you think you could

get used to it? He wants so much to see you."

  "Please don't, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, getting up from her

seat. She moved quickly away, and went to the other window, which

stood open to the balcony; and here, in the embrasure, concealed

from her aunt by the white curtains, she remained a long time, looking

out into the warm darkness. She had had a great shock; it was as if

the gulf of the past had suddenly opened, and a spectral figure had

risen out of it. There were some things she believed she had got over,

some feelings that she had thought of as dead; but apparently there

was a certain vitality in them still. Mrs. Penniman had made them stir

themselves. It was but a momentary agitation, Catherine said to

herself; it would presently pass away. She was trembling, and her

heart was beating so that she could feel it; but this also would

subside. Then suddenly, while she waited for a return of her calmness,

she burst into tears. But her tears flowed very silently, so that Mrs.

Penniman had no observation of them. It was perhaps, however,

because Mrs. Penniman suspected them that she said no more that

evening about Morris Townsend.
