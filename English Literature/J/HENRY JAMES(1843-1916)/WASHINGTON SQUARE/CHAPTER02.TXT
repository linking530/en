  WHEN THE CHILD was about ten years old, he invited his sister,

Mrs. Penniman, to come and stay with him. The Miss Slopers had been

but two in number, and both of them had married early in life. The

younger, Mrs. Almond by name, was the wife of a prosperous merchant

and the mother of a blooming family. She bloomed herself, indeed,

and was a comely, comfortable, reasonable woman, and a favorite with

her clever brother, who, in the matter of women, even when they were

nearly related to him, was a man of distinct preferences. He preferred

Mrs. Almond to his sister Lavinia, who had married a poor clergyman,

of a sickly constitution and a flowery style of eloquence, and then,

at the age of thirty-three, had been left a widow- without children,

without fortune- with nothing but the memory of Mr. Penniman's flowers

of speech, a certain vague aroma of which hovered about her own

conversation. Nevertheless, he had offered her a home under his own

roof, which Lavinia accepted with the alacrity of a woman who had

spent the ten years of her married life in the town of Poughkeepsie.

The doctor had not proposed to Mrs. Penniman to come and live with him

indefinitely; he had suggested that she should make an asylum of his

house while she looked about for unfurnished lodgings. It is uncertain

whether Mrs. Penniman ever instituted a search for unfurnished

lodgings, but it is beyond dispute that she never found them. She

settled herself with her brother and never went away, and, when

Catherine was twenty years old, her Aunt Lavinia was still one of

the most striking features of her immediate entourage. Mrs. Penniman's

own account of the matter was that she had remained to take charge

of her niece's education. She had given this account, at least, to

everyone but the doctor, who never asked for explanations which he

could entertain himself any day with inventing. Mrs. Penniman,

moreover, though she had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial

assurance, shrunk, for indefinable reasons, from presenting herself to

her brother as a fountain of instruction. She had not a high sense

of humor, but she had enough to prevent her from making this

mistake; and her brother, on his side, had enough to excuse her, in

her situation, for laying him under contribution during a considerable

part of a lifetime. He therefore assented tacitly to the proposition

which Mrs. Penniman had tacitly laid down, that it was of importance

that the poor motherless girl should have a brilliant woman near

her. His assent could only be tacit, for he had never been dazzled

by his sister's intellectual luster. Save when he fell in love with

Catherine Harrington, he had never been dazzled, indeed, by any

feminine characteristics whatever; and though he was to a certain

extent what is called a ladies' doctor, his private opinion of the

more complicated sex was not exalted. He regarded its complications as

more curious than edifying, and he had an idea of the beauty of

reason, which was, on the whole, meagerly gratified by what he

observed in his female patients. His wife had been a reasonable woman,

but she was a bright exception; among several things that he was

sure of, this was perhaps the principal. Such a conviction, of course,

did little either to mitigate or to abbreviate his widowhood; and it

set a limit to his recognition, at the best, of Catherine's

possibilities and of Mrs. Penniman's ministrations. He nevertheless,

at the end of six months, accepted his sister's permanent presence

as an accomplished fact, and as Catherine grew older, perceived that

there were in effect good reasons why she should have a companion of

her own imperfect sex. He was extremely polite to Lavinia,

scrupulously, formally polite; and she had never seen him in anger but

once in her life, when he lost his temper in a theological

discussion with her late husband. With her he never discussed

theology, nor, indeed, discussed anything; he contented himself with

making known, very distinctly, in the form of a lucid ultimatum, his

wishes with regard to Catherine.

  Once, when the girl was about twelve years old, he had said to her:

  "Try and make a clever woman of her, Lavinia; I should like her to

be a clever woman."

  Mrs. Penniman, at this, looked thoughtful a moment. "My dear

Austin," she then inquired, "do you think it is better to be clever

than to be good?"

  "Good for what?" asked the doctor. "You are good for nothing

unless you are clever."

  From this assertion Mrs. Penniman saw no reason to dissent; she

possibly reflected that her own great use in the world was owing to

her aptitude for many things.

  "Of course I wish Catherine to be good," the doctor said next day,

"but she won't be any the less virtuous for not being a fool. I am not

afraid of her being wicked; she will never have the salt of malice

in her character. She is 'as good as good bread,' as the French say;

but six years hence I don't want to have to compare her to good

bread and butter."

  "Are you afraid she will be insipid? My dear brother, it is I who

supply the butter; so you needn't fear!" said Mrs. Penniman, who had

taken in hand the child's "accomplishments," overlooking her at the

piano, where Catherine displayed a certain talent, and going with

her to the dancing class, where it must be confessed that she made but

a modest figure.

  Mrs. Penniman was a tall, thin, fair, rather faded woman, with a

perfectly amiable disposition, a high standard of gentility, a taste

for light literature, and a certain foolish indirectness and obliquity

of character. She was romantic; she was sentimental; she had a passion

for little secrets and mysteries- a very innocent passion, for her

secrets had hitherto always been as unpractical as addled eggs. She

was not absolutely veracious; but this defect was of no great

consequence, for she had never had anything to conceal. She would have

liked to have a lover, and to correspond with him under an assumed

name, in letters left at a shop. I am bound to say that her

imagination never carried the intimacy further than this. Mrs.

Penniman had never had a lover, but her brother, who was very

shrewd, understood her turn of mind. "When Catherine is about

seventeen," he said to himself, "Lavinia will try and persuade her

that some young man with a moustache is in love with her. It will be

quite untrue; no young man, with a moustache or without, will ever

be in love with Catherine. But Lavinia will take it up, and talk to

her about it; perhaps, even, if her taste for clandestine operations

doesn't prevail with her, she will talk to me about it. Catherine

won't see it, and won't believe it, fortunately for her peace of mind;

poor Catherine isn't romantic."

  She was a healthy, well-grown child, without a trace of her mother's

beauty. She was not ugly; she had simply a plain, dull, gentle

countenance. The most that had ever been said for her was that she had

a "nice" face; and, though she was an heiress, no one had ever thought

of regarding her as a belle. Her father's opinion of her moral

purity was abundantly justified; she was excellently, imperturbably

good; affectionate, docile, obedient, and much addicted to speaking

the truth. In her younger years she was a good deal of a romp, and,

though it is an awkward confession to make about one's heroine, I must

add that she was something of a glutton. She never, that I know of,

stole raisins out of the pantry; but she devoted her pocket money to

the purchase of cream cakes. As regards this, however, a critical

attitude would be inconsistent with a candid reference to the early

annals of any biographer. Catherine was decidedly not clever; she

was not quick with her book, nor, indeed, with anything else. She

was not abnormally deficient, and she mustered learning enough to

acquit herself respectably in conversation with her contemporaries-

among whom it must be avowed, however, that she occupied a secondary

place. It is well known that in New York it is possible for a young

girl to occupy a primary one. Catherine, who was extremely modest, had

no desire to shine, and on most social occasions, as they are

called, you would have found her lurking in the background. She was

extremely fond of her father, and very much afraid of him; she thought

him the cleverest and handsomest and most celebrated of men. The

poor girl found her account so completely in the exercise of her

affections that the little tremor of fear that mixed itself with her

filial passion gave the thing an extra relish rather than blunted

its edge. Her deepest desire was to please him, and her conception

of happiness was to know that she had succeeded in pleasing him. She

had never succeeded beyond a certain point. Though, on the whole, he

was very kind to her, she was perfectly aware of this, and to go

beyond the point in question seemed to her really something to live

for. What she could not know, of course, was that she disappointed

him, though on three or four occasions the doctor had been almost

frank about it. She grew up peacefully and prosperously; but at the

age of eighteen, Mrs. Penniman had not made a clever woman of her.

Doctor Sloper would have liked to be proud of his daughter; but

there was nothing to be proud of in poor Catherine. There was nothing,

of course, to be ashamed of; but this was not enough for the doctor,

who was a proud man, and would have enjoyed being able to think of his

daughter as an unusual girl. There would have been a fitness in her

being pretty and graceful, intelligent and distinguished- for her

mother had been the most charming woman of her little day- and as

regards her father, of course he knew his own value. He had moments of

irritation at having produced a commonplace child, and he even went so

far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in the thought that his

wife had not lived to find her out. He was naturally slow in making

this discovery himself, and it was not till Catherine had become a

young lady grown that he regarded the matter as settled. He gave her

the benefit of a great many doubts; he was in no haste to conclude.

Mrs. Penniman frequently assured him that his daughter had a

delightful nature; but he knew how to interpret this assurance. It

meant, to his sense, that Catherine was not wise enough to discover

that her aunt was a goose- a limitation of mind that could not fail to

be agreeable to Mrs. Penniman. Both she and her brother, however,

exaggerated the young girl's limitations; for Catherine, though she

was very fond of her aunt, and conscious of the gratitude she owed

her, regarded her without a particle of that gentle dread which gave

its stamp to her admiration of her father. To her mind there was

nothing of the infinite about Mrs. Penniman; Catherine saw her all

at once, as it were, and was not dazzled by the apparition; whereas

her father's great faculties seemed, as they stretched away, to lose

themselves in a sort of luminous vagueness, which indicated, not that

they stopped, but that Catherine's own mind ceased to follow them.

  It must not be supposed that Doctor Sloper visited his

disappointment upon the poor girl, or ever let her suspect that she

had played him a trick. On the contrary, for fear of being unjust to

her, he did his duty with exemplary zeal, and recognized that she

was a faithful and affectionate child. Besides, he was a

philosopher: He smoked a good many cigars over his disappointment, and

in the fullness of time he got used to it. He satisfied himself that

he had expected nothing, though, indeed, with a certain oddity of

reasoning. "I expect nothing," he said to himself, "so that, if she

gives me a surprise, it will be all clear gain. If she doesn't, it

will be no loss." This was about the time Catherine had reached her

eighteenth year; so that it will be seen her father had not been

precipitate. At this time she seemed not only incapable of giving

surprises; it was almost a question whether she could have received

one- she was so quiet and irresponsive. People who expressed

themselves roughly called her stolid. But she was irresponsive because

she was shy, uncomfortably, painfully shy. This was not always

understood, and she sometimes produced an impression of insensibility.

In reality, she was the softest creature in the world.
