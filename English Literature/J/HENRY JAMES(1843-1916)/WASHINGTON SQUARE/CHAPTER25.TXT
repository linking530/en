  THE VOYAGE was indeed uncomfortable, and Catherine, on arriving in

New York, had not the compensation of "going off," in her father's

phrase, with Morris Townsend. She saw him, however, the day after

she landed; and in the meantime he formed a natural subject of

conversation between our heroine and her aunt Lavinia, with whom,

the night she disembarked, the girl was closeted for a long time

before either lady retired to rest.

  "I have seen a great deal of him," said Mrs. Penniman. "He is not

very easy to know. I suppose you think you know him; but you don't, my

dear. You will someday; but it will only be after you have lived

with him. I may almost say I have lived with him," Mrs. Penniman

proceeded, while Catherine stared. "I think I know him now; I have had

such remarkable opportunities. You will have the same- or, rather, you

will have better," and Aunt Lavinia smiled. "Then you will see what

I mean. It's a wonderful character, full of passion and energy, and

just as true."

  Catherine listened with a mixture of interest and apprehension. Aunt

Lavinia was intensely sympathetic, and Catherine, for the past year,

while she wandered through foreign galleries and churches, and

rolled over the smoothness of posting roads, nursing the thoughts that

never passed her lips, had often longed for the company of some

intelligent person of her own sex. To tell her story to some kind

woman- at moments it seemed to her that this would give her comfort,

and she had more than once been on the point of taking the landlady,

or the nice young person from the dressmaker's, into her confidence.

If a woman had been near her, she would on certain occasions have

treated such a companion to a fit of weeping; and she had an

apprehension that, on her return, this would form her response to Aunt

Lavinia's first embrace. In fact, however, the two ladies had met,

in Washington Square, without tears; and when they found themselves

alone together a certain dryness fell upon the girl's emotion. It came

over her with a greater force that Mrs. Penniman had enjoyed a whole

year of her lover's society, and it was not a pleasure to her to

hear her aunt explain and interpret the young man, speaking of him

as if her own knowledge of him were supreme. It was not that Catherine

was jealous; but her sense of Mrs. Penniman's innocent falsity,

which had lain dormant, began to haunt her again, and she was glad

that she was safely at home. With this, however, it was a blessing

to be able to talk of Morris, to sound his name, to be with a person

who was not unjust to him.

  "You have been very kind to him," said Catherine. "He has written me

that, often. I shall never forget that, Aunt Lavinia."

  "I have done what I could; it has been very little. To let him

come and talk to me, and give him his cup of tea- that was all. Your

aunt Almond thought it was too much, and used to scold me terribly;

but she promised me, at least, not to betray me."

  "To betray you?"

  "Not to tell your father. He used to sit in your father's study,"

said Mrs. Penniman, with a little laugh.

  Catherine was silent a moment. This idea was disagreeable to her,

and she was reminded again, with pain, of her aunt's secretive habits.

Morris, the reader may be informed, had had the tact not to tell her

that he sat in her father's study. He had known her but for a few

months, and her aunt had known her for fifteen years; and yet he would

not have made the mistake of thinking that Catherine would see the

joke of the thing. "I am sorry you made him go into Father's room,"

she said, after awhile.

  "I didn't send him; he went himself. He liked to look at the

books, and at all those things in the glass cases. He knows all

about them; he knows all about everything."

  Catherine was silent again; then, "I wish he had found some

employment," she said.

  "He has found some employment. It's beautiful news, and he told me

to tell you as soon as you arrived. He has gone into partnership

with a commission merchant. It was all settled, quite suddenly, a week

ago."

  This seemed to Catherine indeed beautiful news; it had a fine

prosperous air. "Oh, I'm so glad!" she said; and now, for a moment,

she was disposed to throw herself on Aunt Lavinia's neck.

  "It's much better than being under someone; and he has never been

used to that," Mrs. Penniman went on. "He is just as good as his

partner- they are perfectly equal. You see how right he was to wait. I

should like to know what your father can say now! They have got an

office in Duane Street, and little printed cards; he brought me one to

show me. I have got it in my room, and you shall see it tomorrow.

That's what he said to me the last time he was here, 'You see how

right I was to wait.' He has got other people under him instead of

being a subordinate. He could never be a subordinate; I have often

told him I could never think of him in that way."

  Catherine assented to this proposition, and was very happy to know

that Morris was his own master; but she was deprived of the

satisfaction of thinking that she might communicate this news in

triumph to her father. Her father would care equally little whether

Morris were established in business or transported for life. Her

trunks had been brought into her room, and further reference to her

lover was for a short time suspended, while she opened them and

displayed to her aunt some of the spoils of foreign travel. These were

rich and abundant; and Catherine had brought home a present to

everyone- to everyone save Morris, to whom she had brought simply

her undiverted heart. To Mrs. Penniman she had been lavishly generous,

and Aunt Lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and folding again,

with little ejaculations of gratitude and taste. She marched about for

some time in a splendid cashmere shawl, which Catherine had begged her

to accept, settling it on her shoulders, and twisting down her head to

see how low the point descended behind.

  "I shall regard it only as a loan," she said. "I will leave it to

you again when I die; or, rather," she added, kissing her niece again,

"I will leave it to your firstborn little girl." And draped in her

shawl, she stood there smiling.

  "You had better wait till she comes," said Catherine.

  "I don't like the way you say that," Mrs. Penniman rejoined, in a

moment. "Catherine, are you changed?"

  "No; I am the same."

  "You have not swerved a line?"

  "I am exactly the same," Catherine repeated, wishing her aunt were a

little less sympathetic.

  "Well, I am glad," and Mrs. Penniman surveyed her cashmere in the

glass. Then, "How is your father?" she asked, in a moment, with her

eyes on her niece. "Your letters were so meager- I could never tell."

  "Father is very well."

  "Ah, you know what I mean," said Mrs. Penniman, with a dignity to

which the cashmere gave a richer effect. "Is he still implacable?"

  "Oh, yes!"

  "Quite unchanged?"

  "He is, if possible, more firm."

  Mrs. Penniman took off her great shawl, and slowly folded it up.

"That is very bad. You had no success with your little project?"

  "What little project?"

  "Morris told me all about it. The idea of turning the tables on him,

in Europe; of watching him, when he was agreeably impressed by some

celebrated sight- he pretends to be so artistic, you know- and then

just pleading with him and bringing him round."

  "I never tried it. It was Morris's idea; but if he had been with

us in Europe, he would have seen that Father was never impressed in

that way. He is artistic- tremendously artistic; but the more

celebrated places we visited, and the more he admired them, the less

use it would have been to plead with him. They seemed only to make him

more determined- more terrible," said poor Catherine. "I shall never

bring him round, and I expect nothing now."

  "Well, I must say," Mrs. Penniman answered, "I never supposed you

were going to give it up."

  "I have given it up. I don't care now."

  "You have grown very brave," said Mrs. Penniman, with a short laugh.

"I didn't advise you to sacrifice your property."

  "Yes, I am braver than I was. You asked me if I had changed; I

have changed in that way. Oh," the girl went on, "I have changed

very much. And it isn't my property. If he doesn't care for it, why

should I?"

  Mrs. Penniman hesitated. "Perhaps he does care for it."

  "He cares for it for my sake, because he doesn't want to injure

me. But he will know- he knows already- how little he need be afraid

about that. Besides," said Catherine, "I have got plenty of money of

my own. We shall be very well off; and now hasn't he got his business?

I am delighted about that business." She went on talking, showing a

good deal of excitement as she proceeded. Her aunt had never seen

her with just this manner, and Mrs. Penniman, observing her, set it

down to foreign travel, which had made her more positive, more mature.

She thought also that Catherine had improved in appearance; she looked

rather handsome. Mrs. Penniman wondered whether Morris Townsend

would be struck with that. While she was engaged in this

speculation, Catherine broke out, with a certain sharpness, "Why are

you so contradictory, Aunt Penniman? You seem to think one thing at

one time, and another at another. A year ago, before I went away,

you wished me not to mind about displeasing Father, and now you seem

to recommend me to take another line. You change about so."

  This attack was unexpected, for Mrs. Penniman was not used, in any

discussion, to seeing the war carried into her own country- possibly

because the enemy generally had doubts of finding subsistence there.

To her own consciousness, the flowery fields of her reason had

rarely been ravaged by a hostile force. It was perhaps on this account

that in defending them she was majestic rather than agile.

  "I don't know what you accuse me of, save of being too deeply

interested in your happiness. It is the first time I have been told

I am capricious. That fault is not what I am usually reproached with."

  "You were angry last year that I wouldn't marry immediately, and now

you talk about my winning my father over. You told me it would serve

him right if he should take me to Europe for nothing. Well, he has

taken me for nothing, and you ought to be satisfied. Nothing is

changed- nothing but my feeling about Father. I don't mind nearly so

much now. I have been as good as I could, but he doesn't care. Now I

don't care either. I don't know whether I have grown bad; perhaps I

have. But I don't care for that. I have come home to be married-

that's all I know. That ought to please you, unless you have taken

up some new idea; you are so strange. You may do as you please, but

you must never speak to me again about pleading with Father. I shall

never plead with him for anything; that is all over. He has put me

off. I am come home to be married."

  This was a more authoritative speech than she had ever heard on

her niece's lips, and Mrs. Penniman was proportionately startled.

She was, indeed, a little awestruck, and the force of the girl's

emotion and resolution left her nothing to reply. She was easily

frightened, and she always carried off her discomfiture by a

concession- a concession which was often accompanied, as in the

present case, by a little nervous laugh.
