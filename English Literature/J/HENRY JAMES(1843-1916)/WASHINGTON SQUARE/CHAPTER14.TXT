  HE WROTE his frank letter to Mrs. Montgomery, who punctually

answered it, mentioning an hour at which he might present himself in

the Second Avenue. She lived in a neat little house of red brick,

which had been freshly painted, with the edges of the bricks very

sharply marked out in white. It has now disappeared, with its

companions, to make room for a row of structures more majestic.

There were green shutters upon the windows, without slats, but pierced

with little holes, arranged in groups; and before the house was a

diminutive "yard," ornamented with a bush of mysterious character, and

surrounded by a low wooden paling, painted in the same green as the

shutters. The place looked like a magnified baby-house, and might have

been taken down from a shelf in a toy shop. Doctor Sloper, when he

went to call, said to himself, as he glanced at the objects I have

enumerated, that Mrs. Montgomery was evidently a thrifty and

self-respecting little person- the modest proportions of her

dwelling seemed to indicate that she was of small stature- who took

a virtuous satisfaction in keeping herself tidy, and had resolved

that, since she might not be splendid, she would at least be

immaculate. She received him in a little parlor, which was precisely

the parlor he had expected: a small unspeckled bower, ornamented

with a desultory foliage of tissue paper, and with clusters of glass

drops, amidst which- to carry out the analogy- the temperature of

the leafy season was maintained by means of a cast-iron stove,

emitting a dry blue flame, and smelling strongly of varnish. The walls

were embellished with engravings swathed in pink gauze, and the tables

ornamented with volumes of extracts from the poets, usually bound in

black cloth stamped with florid designs in jaundiced gilt. The

doctor had time to take cognizance of these details; for Mrs.

Montgomery, whose conduct he pronounced under the circumstances

inexcusable, kept him waiting some ten minutes before she appeared. At

last, however, she rustled in, smoothing down a stiff poplin dress,

with a little frightened flush in a gracefully rounded cheek.

  She was a small, plump, fair woman, with a bright, clear eye, and an

extraordinary air of neatness and briskness. But these qualities

were evidently combined with an unaffected humility, and the doctor

gave her his esteem as soon as he had looked at her. A brave little

person, with lively perceptions, and yet a disbelief in her own talent

for social, as distinguished from practical, affairs- this was his

rapid mental resume of Mrs. Montgomery; who, as he saw, was

flattered by what she regarded as the honor of his visit. Mrs.

Montgomery, in her little red house in the Second Avenue, was a person

for whom Dr. Sloper was one of the great men- one of the fine

gentlemen of New York; and while she fixed her agitated eyes upon him,

while she clasped her mittened hands together in her glossy poplin

lap, she had the appearance of saying to herself that he quite

answered her idea of what a distinguished guest would naturally be.

She apologized for being late; but he interrupted her.

  "It doesn't matter," he said, "for while I sat here I had time to

think over what I wish to say to you, and to make up my mind how to

begin."

  "Oh, do begin!" murmured Mrs. Montgomery.

  "It is not so easy," said the doctor, smiling. "You will have

gathered from my letter that I wish to ask you a few questions, and

you may not find it very comfortable to answer them."

  "Yes; I have thought what I should say. It is not very easy."

  "But you must understand my situation- my state of mind. Your

brother wishes to marry my daughter, and I wish to find out what

sort of a young man he is. A good way to do so seemed to be to come

and ask you, which I have proceeded to do."

  Mrs. Montgomery evidently took the situation very seriously; she was

in a state of extreme moral concentration. She kept her pretty eyes,

which were illumined by a sort of brilliant modesty, attached to his

own countenance, and evidently paid the most earnest attention to each

of his words. Her expression indicated that she thought his idea of

coming to see her a very superior conception, but that she was

really afraid to have opinions on strange subjects.

  "I am extremely glad to see you," she said, in a tone which seemed

to admit, at the same time, that this had nothing to do with the

question.

  The doctor took advantage of this admission. "I didn't come to see

you for your pleasure; I came to make you say disagreeable things- and

you can't like that. What sort of a gentleman is your brother?"

  Mrs. Montgomery's illuminated gaze grew vague, and began to

wander. She smiled a little, and for some time made no answer, so that

the doctor at last became impatient. And her answer, when it came, was

not satisfactory. "It is difficult to talk about one's brother."

  "Not when one is fond of him, and when one has plenty of good to

say."

  "Yes, even then, when a good deal depends on it," said Mrs.

Montgomery.

  "Nothing depends on it for you."

  "I mean for- for-" and she hesitated.

  "For your brother himself. I see."

  "I mean for Miss Sloper," said Mrs. Montgomery.

  The doctor liked this; it had the accent of sincerity. "Exactly;

that's the point. If my poor girl should marry your brother,

everything- as regards her happiness- would depend on his being a good

fellow. She is the best creature in the world, and she could never

do him a grain of injury. He, on the other hand, if he should not be

all that we desire, might make her very miserable. That is why I

want you to throw some light upon his character, you know. Of

course, you are not bound to do it. My daughter, whom you have never

seen, is nothing to you; and I, possibly, am only an indiscreet and

impertinent old man. It is perfectly open to you to tell me that my

visit is in very bad taste, and that I had better go about my

business. But I don't think you will do this; because I think we shall

interest you- my poor girl and I. I am sure that if you were to see

Catherine she would interest you very much. I don't mean because she

is interesting in the usual sense of the word, but because you would

feel sorry for her. She is so soft, so simpleminded, she would be such

an easy victim! A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for

making her miserable; for she would have neither the intelligence

nor the resolution to get the better of him, and yet she would have an

exaggerated power of suffering. I see," added the doctor, with his

most insinuating, his most professional laugh, "you are already

interested."

  "I have been interested from the moment he told me he was

engaged," said Mrs. Montgomery.

  "Ah, he says that- he calls it an engagement?"

  "Oh, he has told me you didn't like it."

  "Did he tell you that I don't like him?"

  "Yes, he told me that too. I said I couldn't help it," added Mrs.

Montgomery.

  "Of course you can't. But what you can do is to tell me I am

right- to give me an attestation, as it were." And the doctor

accompanied this remark with another professional smile.

  Mrs. Montgomery, however, smiled not at all; it was obvious that she

could not take the humorous view of his appeal. "That is a good deal

to ask," she said, at last.

  "There can be no doubt of that; and I must, in conscience, remind

you of the advantages a young man marrying my daughter would enjoy.

She has an income of ten thousand dollars in her own right, left her

by her mother; if she marries a husband I approve, she will come

into almost twice as much more at my death."

  Mrs. Montgomery listened in great earnestness to this splendid

financial statement; she had never heard thousands of dollars so

familiarly talked about. She flushed a little with excitement. "Your

daughter will be immensely rich," she said, softly.

  "Precisely- that's the bother of it."

  "And if Morris should marry her, he- he-" And she hesitated,

timidly.

  "He would be master of all that money? By no means. He would be

master of the ten thousand a year that she has from her mother; but

I should leave every penny of my own fortune, earned in the

laborious exercise of my profession, to my nephews and nieces."

  Mrs. Montgomery dropped her eyes at this, and sat for some time

gazing at the straw matting which covered her floor.

  "I suppose it seems to you," said the doctor, laughing, "that in

so doing I should play your brother a very shabby trick."

  "Not at all. That is too much money to get possession of so easily

by marrying. I don't think it would be right."

  "It's right to get all one can. But in this case your brother

wouldn't be able. If Catherine marries without my consent, she doesn't

get a penny from my own pocket."

  "Is that certain?" asked Mrs. Montgomery, looking up.

  "As certain as that I sit here."

  "Even if she should pine away?"

  "Even if she should pine to a shadow, which isn't probable."

  "Does Morris know this?"

  "I shall be most happy to inform him," the doctor exclaimed.

  Mrs. Montgomery resumed her meditations; and her visitor, who was

prepared to give time to the affair, asked himself whether, in spite

of her little conscientious air, she was not playing into her

brother's hands. At the same time he was half ashamed of the ordeal to

which he had subjected her, and was touched by the gentleness with

which she bore it. "If she were a humbug," he said, "she would get

angry, unless she be very deep indeed. It is not probable that she

is as deep as that."

  "What makes you dislike Morris so much?" she presently asked,

emerging from her reflections.

  "I don't dislike him in the least as a friend, as a companion. He

seems to me a charming fellow, and I should think he would be

excellent company. I dislike him exclusively as a son-in-law. If the

only office of a son-in-law were to dine at the paternal table, I

should set a high value upon your brother: He dines capitally. But

that is a small part of his function, which, in general, is to be a

protector and caretaker of my child, who is singularly ill-adapted

to take care of herself. It is there that he doesn't satisfy me. I

confess I have nothing but my impression to go by; but I am in the

habit of trusting my impression. Of course you are at liberty to

contradict it flat. He strikes me as selfish and shallow."

  Mrs. Montgomery's eyes expanded a little, and the doctor fancied

he saw the light of admiration in them. "I wonder you have

discovered he is selfish," she exclaimed.

  "Do you think he hides it so well?"

  "Very well indeed," said Mrs. Montgomery. "And I think we are all

rather selfish," she added, quickly.

  "I think so too; but I have seen people hide it better than he.

You see I am helped by a habit I have of dividing people into classes,

into types. I may easily be mistaken about your brother as an

individual, but his type is written on his whole person."

  "He is very good-looking," said Mrs. Montgomery.

  The doctor eyed her a moment. "You women are all the same! But the

type to which your brother belongs was made to be the ruin of you, and

you were made to be its handmaids and victims. The sign of the type in

question is the determination- sometimes terrible in its quiet

intensity- to accept nothing of life but its pleasures, and to

secure these pleasures chiefly by the aid of your complaisant sex.

Young men of this class never do anything for themselves that they can

get other people to do for them, and it is the infatuation, the

devotion, the superstition of others that keeps them going. These

others, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are women. What our

young friends chiefly insist upon is that someone else shall suffer

for them; and women do that sort of thing, as you must know,

wonderfully well." The doctor paused a moment, and then he added,

abruptly, "You have suffered immensely for your brother!"

  This exclamation was abrupt, as I say, but it was also perfectly

calculated. The doctor had been rather disappointed at not finding his

compact and comfortable little hostess surrounded in a more visible

degree by the ravages of Morris Townsend's immorality; but he had said

to himself that this was not because the young man had spared her, but

because she had contrived to plaster up her wounds. They were aching

there behind the varnished stove, the festooned engravings, beneath

her own neat little poplin bosom; and if he could only touch the

tender spot, she would make a movement that would betray her. The

words I have just quoted were an attempt to put his finger suddenly

upon the place, and they had some of the success that he looked for.

The tears sprung for a moment to Mrs. Montgomery's eyes, and she

indulged in a proud little jerk of the head.

  "I don't know how you have found that out!" she exclaimed.

  "By a philosophic trick- by what they call induction. You know you

have always your option of contradicting me. But kindly answer me a

question: Don't you give your brother money? I think you ought to

answer that."

  "Yes, I have given him money," said Mrs. Montgomery.

  "And you have not had much to give him?"

  She was silent a moment. "If you ask me for a confession of poverty,

that is easily made. I am very poor."

  "One would never suppose it from your- your charming house," said

the doctor. "I learned from my sister that your income was moderate,

and your family numerous."

  "I have five children," Mrs. Montgomery observed, "but I am happy to

say I can bring them up decently."

  "Of course you can- accomplished and devoted as you are. But your

brother has counted them over, I suppose?"

  "Counted them over?"

  "He knows there are five, I mean. He tells me it is he that brings

them up."

  Mrs. Montgomery stared a moment, and then quickly- "Oh yes; he

teaches them- Spanish."

  The doctor laughed out. "That must take a great deal off your hands!

Your brother also knows, of course, that you have very little money?"

  "I have often told him so," Mrs. Montgomery exclaimed, more

unreservedly than she had yet spoken. She was apparently taking some

comfort in the doctor's clairvoyance.

  "Which means that you have often occasion to, and that he often

sponges on you. Excuse the crudity of my language; I simply express

a fact. I don't ask you how much of your money he has had, it is

none of my business. I have ascertained what I suspected- what I

wished." And the doctor got up, gently smoothing his hat. "Your

brother lives on you," he said, as he stood there.

  Mrs. Montgomery quickly rose from her chair, following her visitor's

movements with a look of fascination. But then, with a certain

inconsequence, "I have never complained of him," she said.

  "You needn't protest- you have not betrayed him. But I advise you

not to give him any more money."

  "Don't you see it is in my interest that he should marry a rich

person?" she asked. "If, as you say, he lives on me, I can only wish

to get rid of him; and to put obstacles in the way of his marrying

is to increase my own difficulties."

  "I wish very much you would come to me with your difficulties," said

the doctor. "Certainly, if I throw him back on your hands, the least I

can do is to help you to bear the burden. If you will allow me to

say so, then, I shall take the liberty of placing in your hands, for

the present, a certain fund for your brother's support."

  Mrs. Montgomery stared; she evidently thought he was jesting; but

she presently saw that he was not, and the complication of her

feelings became painful. "It seems to me that I ought to be very

much offended with you," she murmured.

  "Because I have offered you money? That's a superstition," said

the doctor. "You must let me come and see you again, and we will

talk about these things. I suppose that some of your children are

girls?"

  "I have two little girls," said Mrs. Montgomery.

  "Well, when they grow up, and begin to think of taking husbands, you

will see how anxious you will be about the moral character of these

husbands. Then you will understand this visit of mine."

  "Ah, you are not to believe that Morris's moral character is bad."

  The doctor looked at her a little, with folded arms. "There is

something I should greatly like, as a moral satisfaction. I should

like to hear you say, 'He is abominably selfish.'"

  The words came out with the grave distinctness of his voice, and

they seemed for an instant to create, to poor Mrs. Montgomery's

troubled vision, a material image. She gazed at it an instant, and

then she turned away. "You distress me, sir!" she exclaimed. "He is,

after all, my brother; and his talents, his talents-" On these last

words her voice quavered, and before he knew it she had burst into

tears.

  "His talents are first-rate," said the doctor. "We must find the

proper field for them." And he assured her most respectfully of his

regret at having so greatly discomposed her. "It's all for my poor

Catherine," he went on. "You must know her, and you will see."

  Mrs. Montgomery brushed away her tears, and blushed at having shed

them. "I should like to know your daughter," she answered; and then,

in an instant, "Don't let her marry him!"

  Doctor Sloper went away with the words gently humming in his ears:

"Don't let her marry him!" They gave him the moral satisfaction of

which he had just spoken, and their value was the greater that they

had evidently cost a pang to poor little Mrs. Montgomery's family

pride.
