                         CHAPTER 1.



  DURING A PORTION of the first half of the present century, and

more particularly during the latter part of it, there flourished and

practiced in the city of New York a physician who enjoyed perhaps an

exceptional share of the consideration which, in the United States,

has always been bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical

profession. This profession in America has constantly been held in

honor, and more successfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to

the epithet of "liberal." In a country in which, to play a social

part, you must either earn your income or make believe that you earn

it, the healing art has appeared in a high degree to combine two

recognized sources of credit. It belongs to the realm of the

practical, which in the United States is a great recommendation; and

it is touched by the light of science- a merit appreciated in a

community in which the love of knowledge has not always been

accompanied by leisure and opportunity.

  It was an element in Doctor Sloper's reputation that his learning

and his skill were very evenly balanced; he was what you might call

a scholarly doctor, and yet there was nothing abstract in his

remedies- he always ordered you to take something. Though he was

felt to be extremely thorough, he was not uncomfortably theoretic; and

if he sometimes explained matters rather more minutely than might seem

of use to the patient, he never went so far (like some practitioners

one had heard of) as to trust to the explanation alone, but always

left behind him an inscrutable prescription. There were some doctors

that left the prescription without offering any explanation at all;

and he did not belong to that class either, which was after all the

most vulgar. It will be seen that I am describing a clever man; and

this is really the reason why Doctor Sloper had become a local

celebrity.

  At the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him he was some

fifty years of age, and his popularity was at its height. He was

very witty, and he passed in the best society of New York for a man of

the world- which, indeed, he was, in a very sufficient degree. I

hasten to add, to anticipate possible misconception, that he was not

the least of a charlatan. He was a thoroughly honest man- honest in

a degree of which he had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the

complete measure; and, putting aside the great good nature of the

circle in which he practiced, which was rather fond of boasting that

it possessed the "brightest" doctor in the country, he daily justified

his claim to the talents attributed to him by the popular voice. He

was an observer, even a philosopher, and to be bright was so natural

to him, and (as the popular voice said) came so easily, that he

never aimed at mere effect, and had none of the little tricks and

pretensions of second-rate reputations. It must be confessed that

fortune had favored him, and that he had found the path to

prosperity very soft to his tread. He had married, at the age of

twenty-seven, for love, a very charming girl, Miss Catherine

Harrington, of New York, who, in addition to her charms, had brought

him a solid dowry. Mrs. Sloper was amiable, graceful, accomplished,

elegant, and in 1820 she had been one of the pretty girls of the small

but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and overlooked

the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by the

grassy waysides of Canal Street. Even at the age of twenty-seven

Austin Sloper had made his mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly

of his having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of

high fashion, who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most

charming eyes in the island of Manhattan. These eyes, and some of

their accompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme

satisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a very

happy husband.

  The fact of his having married a rich woman made no difference in

the line he had traced for himself, and he cultivated his profession

with as definite a purpose as if he still had no other resources

than his fraction of the modest patrimony which, on his father's

death, he had shared with his brothers and sisters. This purpose had

not been preponderantly to make money- it had been rather to learn

something and to do something. To learn something interesting, and

to do something useful- this was, roughly speaking, the program he had

sketched, and of which the accident of his wife having an income

appeared to him in no degree to modify the validity. He was fond of

his practice, and of exercising a skill of which he was agreeably

conscious, and it was so patent a truth that if he were not a doctor

there was nothing else he could be, that a doctor he persisted in

being, in the best possible conditions. Of course his easy domestic

situation saved him a good deal of drudgery, and his wife's

affiliation to the "best people" brought him a good many of those

patients whose symptoms are, if not more interesting in themselves

than those of the lower orders, at least more consistently

displayed. He desired experience, and in the course of twenty years he

got a great deal. It must be added that it came to him in some forms

which, whatever might have been their intrinsic value, made it the

reverse of welcome. His first child, a little boy of extraordinary

promise, as the doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasm,

firmly believed, died at three years of age, in spite of everything

that the mother's tenderness and the father's science could invent

to save him. Two years later Mrs. Sloper gave birth to a second

infant- an infant of a sex which rendered the poor child, to the

doctor's sense, an inadequate substitute for his lamented

firstborn, of whom he had promised himself to make an admirable man.

The little girl was a disappointment; but this was not the worst. A

week after her birth the young mother, who, as the phrase is, had been

doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms, and before another

week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a widower.

  For a man whose trade was to keep people alive he had certainly done

poorly in his own family; and a bright doctor who within three years

loses his wife and his little boy should perhaps be prepared to see

either his skill or his affection impugned. Our friend, however,

escaped criticism; that is, he escaped all criticism but his own,

which was much the most competent and most formidable. He walked under

the weight of this very private censure for the rest of his days,

and bore forever the scars of a castigation to which the strongest

hand he knew had treated him on the night that followed his wife's

death. The world, which, as I have said, appreciated him, pitied him

too much to be ironical; his misfortune made him more interesting, and

even helped him to be the fashion. It was observed that even medical

families cannot escape the more insidious forms of disease, and

that, after all, Doctor Sloper had lost other patients besides the two

I have mentioned; which constituted an honorable precedent. His little

girl remained to him; and though she was not what he had desired, he

proposed to himself to make the best of her. He had on hand a stock of

unexpended authority, by which the child, in its early years, profited

largely. She had been named, as a matter of course, after her poor

mother, and even in her most diminutive babyhood the doctor never

called her anything but Catherine. She grew up a very robust and

healthy child, and her father, as he looked at her, often said to

himself that, such as she was, he at least need have no fear of losing

her. I say "such as she was," because, to tell the truth- But this

is a truth of which I will defer the telling.
