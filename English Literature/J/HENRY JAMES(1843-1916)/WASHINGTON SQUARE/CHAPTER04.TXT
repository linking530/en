  MRS. PENNIMAN, with more buckles and bangles than ever, came, of

course, to the entertainment, accompanied by her niece; the doctor,

too, had promised to look in later in the evening. There was to be a

good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far Marian Almond

came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She introduced

the young man as a person who had a great desire to make your

heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own

intended.

  Marian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very

small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners

matrimony had nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a

hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so

many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made

a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered

a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had

not understood all that she said; her attention was given to

enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking

at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded,

however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to

her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of

Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an

introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some

people- her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance- should mind

it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be

the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present

were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her no time for

embarrassment, began to talk to her with an easy smile, as if he had

known her for a year.

  "What a delightful party! What a charming house! What an interesting

family! What a pretty girl your cousin is!"

  These observations, in themselves of no great profundity, Mr.

Townsend seemed to offer for what they were worth, and as a

contribution to an acquaintance. He looked straight into Catherine's

eyes. She answered nothing; she only listened, and looked at him;

and he, as if he expected no particular reply, went on to say many

other things in the same comfortable and natural manner. Catherine,

though she felt tongue-tied, was conscious of no embarrassment; it

seemed proper that he should talk, and that she should simply look

at him. What made it natural was that he was so handsome, or,

rather, as she phrased it to herself, so beautiful. The music had been

silent for awhile, but it suddenly began again; and then he asked her,

with a deeper, intenser smile, if she would do him the honor of

dancing with him. Even to this inquiry she gave no audible assent; she

simply let him put his arm round her waist- as she did so, it occurred

to her more vividly than it had ever done before that this was a

singular place for a gentleman's arm to be- and in a moment he was

guiding her round the room in the harmonious rotation of the polka.

When they paused, she felt that she was red; and then, for some

moments, she stopped looking at him. She fanned herself, and looked at

the flowers that were painted on her fan. He asked her if she would

begin again, and she hesitated to answer, still looking at the

flowers.

  "Does it make you dizzy?" he asked, in a tone of great kindness.

  Then Catherine looked up at him; he was certainly beautiful, and not

at all red. "Yes," she said; she hardly knew why, for dancing had

never made her dizzy.

  "Ah, well, in that case," said Mr. Townsend, "we will sit still

and talk. I will find a good place to sit."

  He found a good place- a charming place, a little sofa that seemed

meant only for two persons. The rooms by this time were very full; the

dancers increased in number, and people stood close in front of

them, turning their backs, so that Catherine and her companion

seemed secluded and unobserved. "We will talk," the young man had

said, but he still did all the talking. Catherine leaned back in her

place, with her eyes fixed upon him, smiling, and thinking him very

clever. He had features like young men in pictures; Catherine had

never seen such features- so delicate, so chiseled and finished- among

the young New Yorkers whom she passed in the streets and met at

dancing parties. He was tall and slim, but he looked extremely strong.

Catherine thought he looked like a statue. But a statue would not talk

like that, and, above all, would not have eyes of so rare a color.

He had never been at Mrs. Almond's before; he felt very much like a

stranger; and it was very kind of Catherine to take pity on him. He

was Arthur Townsend's cousin- not very near, several times removed-

and Arthur had brought him to present him to the family. In fact, he

was a great stranger in New York. It was his native place; but he

had not been there for many years. He had been knocking about the

world, and living in queer corners; he had only come back a month or

two before. New York was very pleasant, only he felt lonely.

  "You see, people forget you," he said, smiling at Catherine with his

delightful gaze, while he leaned forward obliquely, turning toward

her, with his elbows on his knees.

  It seemed to Catherine that no one who had once seen him would

ever forget him; but though she made this reflection she kept it to

herself; almost as you would keep something precious.

  They sat there for some time. He was very amusing. He asked her

about the people that were near them; he tried to guess who some of

them were, and he made the most laughable mistakes. He criticized them

very freely, in a positive, offhand way. Catherine had never heard

anyone- especially any young man- talk just like that. It was the

way a young man might talk in a novel, or, better still, in a play, on

the stage, close before the footlights, looking at the audience, and

with everyone looking at him, so that you wondered at his presence

of mind. And yet Mr. Townsend was not like an actor; he seemed so

sincere, so natural. This was very interesting; but in the midst of it

Marian Almond came pushing through the crowd, with a little ironical

cry, when she found these young people still together, which made

everyone turn round, and cost Catherine a conscious blush. Marian

broke up their talk, and told Mr. Townsend- whom she treated as if she

were already married, and he had become her cousin- to run away to her

mother, who had been wishing for the last half hour to introduce him

to Mr. Almond.

  "We shall meet again," he said to Catherine as he left her, and

Catherine thought it a very original speech.

  Her cousin took her by the arm, and made her walk about. "I

needn't ask you what you think of Morris," the young girl exclaimed.

  "Is that his name?"

  "I don't ask you what you think of his name, but what you think of

himself," said Marian.

  "Oh, nothing particular," Catherine answered, dissembling for the

first time in her life.

  "I have half a mind to tell him that!" cried Marian. "It will do him

good; he's so terribly conceited."

  "Conceited?" said Catherine, staring.

  "So Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him."

  "Oh, don't tell him!" Catherine murmured, imploringly.

  "Don't tell him he's conceited! I have told him so a dozen times."

  At this profession of audacity Catherine looked down at her little

companion in amazement. She supposed it was because Marian was going

to be married that she took so much on herself; but she wondered

too, whether, when she herself should become engaged, such exploits

would be expected of her.

  Half an hour later she saw her Aunt Penniman sitting in the

embrasure of a window, with her head a little on one side, and her

gold eyeglass raised to her eyes, which were wandering about the room.

In front of her was a gentleman, bending forward a little, with his

back turned to Catherine. She knew his back immediately, though she

had never seen it; for when he left her, at Marian's instigation, he

had retreated in the best order, without turning round. Morris

Townsend- the name had already become very familiar to her, as if

someone had been repeating it in her ear for the last half hour-

Morris Townsend was giving his impressions of the company to her aunt,

as he had done to herself; he was saying clever things, and Mrs.

Penniman was smiling, as if she approved of them. As soon as Catherine

had perceived this she moved away; she would not have liked him to

turn round and see her. But it gave her pleasure- the whole thing.

That he should talk with Mrs. Penniman, with whom she lived and whom

she saw and talked with every day- that seemed to keep him near her,

and to make him even easier to contemplate than if she herself had

been the object of his civilities; and that Aunt Lavinia should like

him, should not be shocked or startled by what he said, this also

appeared to the girl a personal gain; for Aunt Lavinia's standard

was extremely high, planted as it was over the grave of her late

husband, in which, as she had convinced everyone, the very genius of

conversation was buried. One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called

them, invited our heroine to dance a quadrille, and for a quarter of

an hour her feet at least were occupied. This time she was not

dizzy; her head was very clear. Just when the dance was over, she

found herself in the crowd face to face with her father. Doctor Sloper

had usually a little smile, never a very big one, and with this little

smile playing in his clear eyes and on his neatly shaved lips, he

looked at his daughter's crimson gown.

  "Is it possible that this magnificent person is my child?" he said.

  You would have surprised him if you had told him so, but it is a

literal fact that he almost never addressed his daughter save in the

ironical form. Whenever he addressed her he gave her pleasure; but she

had to cut her pleasure out of the pieces, as it were. There were

portions left over, light remnants and snippets of irony, which she

never knew what to do with, which seemed too delicate for her own use;

and yet Catherine, lamenting the limitations of her understanding,

felt that they were too valuable to waste, and had a belief that if

they passed over her head they yet contributed to the general sum of

human wisdom.

  "I am not magnificent," she said, mildly, wishing that she had put

on another dress.

  "You are sumptuous, opulent, expensive," her father rejoined. "You

look as if you had eighty thousand a year."

  "Well, so long as I haven't,-" said Catherine, illogically. Her

conception of her prospective wealth was as yet very indefinite.

  "So long as you haven't you shouldn't look as if you had. Have you

enjoyed your party!"

  Catherine hesitated a moment; and then, looking away, "I am rather

tired," she murmured. I have said that this entertainment was, the

beginning of something important for Catherine. For the second time in

her life she made an indirect answer; and the beginning of a period of

dissimulation is certainly a significant date. Catherine was not so

easily tired as that.

  Nevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, she was as

quiet as if fatigue had been her portion. Doctor Sloper's manner of

addressing his sister Lavinia had a good deal of resemblance to the

tone he had adopted toward Catherine.

  "Who was the young man that was making love to you?" he presently

asked.

  "Oh, my good brother!" murmured Mrs. Penniman, in deprecation.

  "He seemed uncommonly tender. Whenever I looked at you for half an

hour, he had the most devoted air."

  "The devotion was not to me," said Mrs. Penniman. "It was to

Catherine; he talked to me of her."

  Catherine had been listening with all her ears. "Oh, Aunt Penniman!"

she exclaimed, faintly.

  "He is very handsome; he is very clever; he expressed himself with a

great deal- a great deal of felicity," her aunt went on.

  "He is in love with this regal creature, then?" the doctor inquired,

humorously.

  "Oh, Father!" cried the girl, still more faintly, devoutly

thankful the carriage was dark.

  "I don't know that; but he admired her dress."

  Catherine did not say to herself in the dark, "My dress only?"

Mrs. Penniman's announcement struck her by its richness, not by its

meagerness.

  "You see," said her father, "he thinks you have eighty thousand a

year."

  "I don't believe he thinks of that," said Mrs. Penniman. "He is

too refined."

  "He must be tremendously refined not to think of that!"

  "Well, he is!" Catherine exclaimed, before she knew it.

  "I thought you had gone to sleep," her father answered. "The hour

has come!" he added to himself. "Lavinia is going to get up a

romance for Catherine. It's a shame to play such tricks on the girl.

What is the gentleman's name?" he went on, aloud.

  "I didn't catch it, and I didn't like to ask him. He asked to be

introduced to me," said Mrs. Penniman, with a certain grandeur, "but

you know how indistinctly Jefferson speaks." Jefferson was Mr. Almond.

"Catherine, dear, what was the gentleman's name?"

  For a minute, if it had not been for the rumbling of the carriage,

you might have heard a pin drop.

  "I don't know, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, very softly. And, with

all his irony, her father believed her.
