  HE LEARNED what he had asked some three or four days later, after

Morris Townsend, with his cousin, had called in Washington Square.

Mrs. Penniman did not tell her brother, on the drive home, that she

had intimated to this agreeable young man, whose name she did not

know, that, with her niece, she should be very glad to see him; but

she was greatly pleased, and even a little flattered, when, late on

a Sunday afternoon, the two gentlemen made their appearance. His

coming with Arthur Townsend made it more natural and easy; the

latter young man was on the point of becoming connected with the

family, and Mrs. Penniman had remarked to Catherine that, as he was

going to marry Marian, it would be polite in him to call. These events

came to pass late in the autumn, and Catherine and her aunt had been

sitting together in the closing dusk, by the firelight, in the high

back parlor.

  Arthur Townsend fell to Catherine's portion, while his companion

placed himself on the sofa beside Mrs. Penniman. Catherine had

hitherto not been a harsh critic; she was easy to please- she liked to

talk with young men. But Marian's betrothed, this evening, made her

feel vaguely fastidious; he sat looking at the fire and rubbing his

knees with his hands. As for Catherine, she scarcely even pretended to

keep up the conversation; her attention had fixed itself on the

other side of the room; she was listening to what went on between

the other Mr. Townsend and her aunt. Every now and then he looked over

at Catherine herself and smiled, as if to show that what he said was

for her benefit too. Catherine would have liked to change her place,

to go and sit near them, where she might see and hear him better.

But she was afraid of seeming bold- of looking eager; and, besides, it

would not have been polite to Marian's little suitor. She wondered why

the other gentleman had picked out her aunt- how he came to have so

much to say to Mrs. Penniman, to whom, usually, young men were not

especially devoted. She was not at all jealous of Aunt Lavinia, but

she was a little envious, and, above all, she wondered; for Morris

Townsend was an object on which she found that her imagination could

exercise itself indefinitely. His cousin had been describing a house

that he had taken in view of his union with Marian, and the domestic

conveniences he meant to introduce into it; how Marian wanted a larger

one, and Mrs. Almond recommended a smaller one, and how he himself was

convinced that he had got the neatest house in New York.

  "It doesn't matter," he said. "It's only for three or four years. At

the end of three or four years we'll move. That's the way to live in

New York- to move every three or four years. Then you always get the

last thing. It's because the city's growing so quick- you've got to

keep up with it. It's going straight uptown- that's where New York's

going. If I wasn't afraid Marian would be lonely, I'd go up there-

right up to the top- and wait for it. Only have to wait ten years-

they'll all come up after you. But Marian says she wants some

neighbors- she doesn't want to be a pioneer. She says that if she's

got to be the first settler she had better go out to Minnesota. I

guess we'll move up little by little; when we get tired of one

street we'll go higher. So you see we'll always have a new house; it's

a great advantage to have a new house; you get all the latest

improvements. They invent everything all over again about every five

years, and it's a great thing to keep up with the new things. I always

try and keep up with the new things of every kind. Don't you think

that's a good motto for a young couple- to keep 'going higher'? What's

the name of that piece of poetry- what do they call it?- 'Excelsior!'"

  Catherine bestowed on her junior visitor only just enough

attention to feel that this was not the way Mr. Morris Townsend had

talked the other night, or that he was talking now to her fortunate

aunt. But suddenly his aspiring kinsman became more interesting. He

seemed to have become conscious that she was affected by his

companion's presence, and he thought it proper to explain it.

  "My cousin asked me to bring him, or I shouldn't have taken the

liberty. He seemed to want very much to come; you know he's awfully

sociable. I told him I wanted to ask you first, but he said Mrs.

Penniman had invited him. He isn't particular what he says when he

wants to come somewhere. But Mrs. Penniman seems to think it's all

right."

  "We are very glad to see him," said Catherine. And she wished to

talk more about him, but she hardly knew what to say. "I never saw him

before," she went on, presently.

  Arthur Townsend stared.

  "Why, he told me he talked with you for over half an hour the

other night."

  "I mean before the other night. That was the first time."

  "Oh, he has been away from New York- he has been all round the

world. He doesn't know many people here, but he's very sociable, and

he wants to know everyone."

  "Everyone?" said Catherine.

  "Well, I mean all the good ones. All the pretty young ladies- like

Mrs. Penniman!" And Arthur Townsend gave a private laugh.

  "My aunt likes him very much," said Catherine.

  "Most people like him- he's so brilliant."

  "He's more like a foreigner," Catherine suggested.

  "Well, I never knew a foreigner," said young Townsend, in a tone

which seemed to indicate that his ignorance had been optional.

  "Neither have I," Catherine confessed, with more humility. "They say

they are generally brilliant," she added, vaguely.

  "Well, the people of this city are clever enough for me. I know some

of them that think they are too clever for me; but they ain't."

  "I suppose you can't be too clever," said Catherine, still with

humility.

  "I don't know. I know some people that call my cousin too clever."

  Catherine listened to this statement with extreme interest, and a

feeling that if Morris Townsend had a fault it would naturally be that

one. But she did not commit herself, and in a moment she asked, "Now

that he has come back, will he stay here always?"

  "Ah," said Arthur, "if he can get something to do."

  "Something to do?"

  "Some place or other; some business."

  "Hasn't he got any?" said Catherine, who had never heard of a

young man- of the upper class- in this situation.

  "No, he's looking round. But he can't find anything."

  "I am very sorry," Catherine permitted herself to observe.

  "Oh, he doesn't mind," said young Townsend. "He takes it easy- he

isn't in a hurry. He is very particular."

  Catherine thought he naturally would be, and gave herself up for

some moments to the contemplation of this idea, in several of its

bearings.

  "Won't his father take him into his business- his office?" she at

last inquired.

  "He hasn't got any father- he has only got a sister. Your sister

can't help you much."

  It seemed to Catherine that if she were his sister she would

disprove this axiom. "If she- is she pleasant?" she asked in a moment.

  "I don't know- I believe she's very respectable," said young

Townsend. And then he looked across to his cousin and began to

laugh. "I say, we are talking about you," he added.

  Morris Townsend paused in his conversation with Mrs. Penniman, and

stared, with a little smile. Then he got up, as if he were going.

  "As far as you are concerned, I can't return the compliment," he

said to Catherine's companion. "But as regards Miss Sloper, it's

another affair."

  Catherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned; but

she was embarrassed by it, and she also got up. Morris Townsend

stood looking at her and smiling; he put out his hand for farewell. He

was going, without having said anything to her; but even on these

terms she was glad to have seen him.

  "I will tell her what you have said- when you go!" said Mrs.

Penniman, with a little significant laugh.

  Catherine blushed, for she felt almost as if they were making

sport of her. What in the world could this beautiful young man have

said? He looked at her still, in spite of her blush, but very kindly

and respectfully.

  "I have had no talk with you," he said, "and that was what I came

for. But it will be a good reason for coming another time, a little

pretext- if I am obliged to give one. I am not afraid of what your

aunt will say when I go."

  With this the two young men took their departure; after which

Catherine, with her blush still lingering, directed a serious and

interrogative eye to Mrs. Penniman. She was incapable of elaborate

artifice, and she resorted to no jocular device- to no affectation

of the belief that she had been maligned- to learn what she desired.

  "What did you say you would tell me?" she asked.

  Mrs. Penniman came up to her, smiling and nodding a little, looked

at her all over, and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in her neck.

"It's a great secret, my dear child, but he is coming a-courting!"

  Catherine was serious still. "Is that what he told you?"

  "He didn't say so exactly, but he left me to guess it. I'm a good

guesser."

  "Do you mean a-courting me?"

  "Not me, certainly, miss; though I must say he is a hundred times

more polite to a person who has no longer extreme youth to recommend

her than most of the young men. He is thinking of someone else." And

Mrs. Penniman gave her niece a delicate little kiss. "You must be very

gracious to him."

  Catherine stared- she was bewildered. "I don't understand you,"

she said. "He doesn't know me."

  "Oh yes, he does; more than you think. I have told him all about

you."

  "Oh, Aunt Penniman!" murmured Catherine, as if this had been a

breach of trust. "He is a perfect stranger- we don't know him."

There was infinite modesty in the poor girl's "we."

  Aunt Penniman, however, took no account of it; she spoke even with a

touch of acrimony. "My dear Catherine, you know very well that you

admire him."

  "Oh, Aunt Penniman!" Catherine could only murmur again. It might

very well be that she admired him- though this did not seem to her a

thing to talk about. But that this brilliant stranger- this sudden

apparition, who had barely heard the sound of her voice- took that

sort of interest in her that was expressed by the romantic phrase of

which Mrs. Penniman had just made use- this could only be a figment of

the restless brain of Aunt Lavinia, whom everyone knew to be a woman

of powerful imagination.
