  THE DOCTOR, during the first six months he was abroad, never spoke

to his daughter of their little difference, partly on system, and

partly because he had a great many other things to think about. It was

idle to attempt to ascertain the state of her affections without

direct inquiry, because if she had not had an expressive manner

among the familiar influences of home, she failed to gather

animation from the mountains of Switzerland or the monuments of Italy.

She was always her father's docile and reasonable associate- going

through their sight-seeing in deferential silence, never complaining

of fatigue, always ready to start at the hour he had appointed

overnight, making no foolish criticisms, and indulging in no

refinements of appreciation. "She is about as intelligent as the

bundle of shawls," the doctor said, her main superiority being that,

while the bundle of shawls sometimes got lost, or tumbled out of the

carriage, Catherine was always at her post, and had a firm and ample

seat. But her father had expected this, and he was not constrained

to set down her intellectual limitations as a tourist to sentimental

depression; she had completely divested herself of the characteristics

of a victim, and during the whole time that they were abroad she never

uttered an audible sigh. He supposed she was in correspondence with

Morris Townsend, but he held his peace about it, for he never saw

the young man's letters, and Catherine's own missives were always

given to the courier to post. She heard from her lover with

considerable regularity, but his letters came enclosed in Mrs.

Penniman's; so that, whenever the doctor handed her a packet addressed

in his sister's hand, he was an involuntary instrument of the

passion he condemned. Catherine made this reflection, and six months

earlier she would have felt bound to give him warning; but now she

deemed herself absolved. There was a sore spot in her heart that his

own words had made when once she spoke to him as she thought honor

prompted; she would try and please him as far as she could, but she

would never speak that way again. She read her lover's letters in

secret.

  One day, at the end of the summer, the two travelers found

themselves in a lonely valley of the Alps. They were crossing one of

the passes, and on the long ascent they had got out of the carriage

and had wandered much in advance. After awhile the doctor descried a

footpath which, leading through a transverse valley, would bring

them out, as he justly supposed, at a much higher point of the ascent.

They followed this devious way, and finally lost the path; the

valley proved very wild and rough, and their walk became rather a

scramble. They were good walkers, however, and they took their

adventure easily; from time to time they stopped, that Catherine might

rest; and then she sat upon a stone and looked about her at the

hard-featured rocks and the glowing sky. It was late in the afternoon,

in the last of August; night was coming on, and as they had reached

a great elevation, the air was cold and sharp. In the west there was a

great suffusion of cold red light, which made the sides of the

little valley look only the more rugged and dusky. During one of their

pauses her father left her and wandered away to some high place, at

a distance, to get a view. He was out of sight; she sat there alone in

the stillness, which was just touched by the vague murmur somewhere of

a mountain brook. She thought of Morris Townsend, and the place was so

desolate and lonely that he seemed very far away. Her father

remained absent a long time; she began to wonder what had become of

him. But at last he reappeared, coming toward her in the clear

twilight, and she got up to go on. He made no motion to proceed,

however, but came close to her, as if he had something to say. He

stopped in front of her, and stood looking at her with eyes that had

kept the light of the flushing snow-summits on which they had just

been fixed. Then, abruptly, in a low tone, he asked her an

unexpected question, "Have you given him up?"

  The question was unexpected, but Catherine was only superficially

unprepared.

  "No, Father," she answered.

  He looked at her again for some moments without speaking.

  "Does he write to you?" he asked.

  "Yes, about twice a month."

  The doctor looked up and down the valley, swinging his stick; then

he said to her, in the same low tone, "I am very angry."

  She wondered what he meant- whether he wished to frighten her. If he

did, the place was well chosen: This hard, melancholy dell,

abandoned by the summer light, made her feel her loneliness. She

looked around her, and her heart grew cold; for a moment her fear

was great. But she could think of nothing to say, save to murmur,

gently, "I am sorry."

  "You try my patience," her father went on, "and you ought to know

what I am. I am not a very good man. Though I am very smooth

externally, at bottom I am very passionate; and I assure you I can

be very hard."

  She could not think why he told her these things. Had he brought her

there on purpose, and was it part of a plan? What was the plan?

Catherine asked herself. Was it to startle her suddenly into a

retraction- to take an advantage of her by dread? Dread of what? The

place was ugly and lonely, but the place could do her no harm. There

was a kind of still intensity about her father which made him

dangerous, but Catherine hardly went so far as to say to herself

that it might be part of his plan to fasten his hand- the neat,

fine, supple hand of a distinguished physician- in her throat.

Nevertheless, she receded a step. "I am sure you can be anything you

please," she said; and it was her simple belief.

  "I am very angry," he replied, more sharply.

  "Why has it taken you so suddenly?"

  "It has not taken me suddenly. I have been raging inwardly for the

last six months. But just now this seemed a good place to flare out.

It's so quiet, and we are alone."

  "Yes, it's very quiet," said Catherine, vaguely looking about her.

"Won't you come back to the carriage?"

  "In a moment. Do you mean that in all this time you have not yielded

an inch?"

  "I would if I could, Father; but I can't."

  The doctor looked round him too. "Should you like to be left in such

a place as this, to starve?"

  "What do you mean?" cried the girl.

  "That will be your fate- that's how he will leave you."

  He would not touch her, but he had touched Morris. The warmth came

back to her heart. "That is not true, Father," she broke out, "and you

ought not to say it. It is not right, and it's not true."

  He shook his head slowly. "No, it's not right, because you won't

believe it. But it is true. Come back to the carriage."

  He turned away, and she followed him; he went faster, and was

presently much in advance. But from time to time he stopped, without

turning round, to let her keep up with him, and she made her way

forward with difficulty, her heart beating with the excitement of

having for the first time spoken to him in violence. By this time it

had grown almost dark, and she ended by losing sight of him. But she

kept her course, and after a little, the valley making a sudden

turn, she gained the road, where the carriage stood waiting. In it sat

her father, rigid and silent; in silence, too, she took her place

beside him.

  It seemed to her, later, in looking back upon all this, that for

days afterward not a word had been exchanged between them. The scene

had been a strange one, but it had not permanently affected her

feeling toward her father, for it was natural, after all, that he

should occasionally make a scene of some kind, and he had let her

alone for six months. The strangest part of it was that he had said he

was not a good man; Catherine wondered a good deal what he had meant

by that. The statement failed to appeal to her credence, and it was

not grateful to any resentment that she entertained. Even in the

utmost bitterness that she might feel, it would give her no

satisfaction to think him less complete. Such a saying as that was a

part of his great subtlety- men so clever as he might say anything and

mean anything; and as to his being hard, that surely, in a man, was

a virtue.

  He let her alone for six months more- six months during which she

accommodated herself without a protest to the extension of their tour.

But he spoke again at the end of this time: It was at the very last,

the night before they embarked for New York, in the hotel at

Liverpool. They had been dining together in a great, dim, musty

sitting room; and then the cloth had been removed, and the doctor

walked slowly up and down. Catherine at last took her candle to go

to bed, but her father motioned her to stay.

  "What do you mean to do when you get home?" he asked, while she

stood there with her candle in her hand.

  "Do you mean about Mr. Townsend?"

  "About Mr. Townsend."

  "We shall probably marry."

  The doctor took several turns again while she waited. "Do you hear

from him as much as ever?"

  "Yes, twice a month," said Catherine, promptly.

  "And does he always talk about marriage?"

  "Oh yes; that is, he talks about other things too, but he always

says something about that."

  "I am glad to hear he varies his subjects; his letters might

otherwise be monotonous."

  "He writes beautifully," said Catherine, who was very glad of a

chance to say it.

  "They always write beautifully. However, in a given case that

doesn't diminish the merit. So, as soon as you arrive, you are going

off with him?"

  This seemed a rather gross way of putting it, and something that

there was of dignity in Catherine resented it. "I cannot tell you till

we arrive," she said.

  "That's reasonable enough," her father answered. "That's all I ask

of you- that you do tell me, that you give me definite notice. When

a poor man is to lose his only child, he likes to have an inkling of

it beforehand."

  "Oh, Father, you will not lose me," Catherine said, spilling her

candle wax.

  "Three days before will do," he went on, "if you are in a position

to be positive then. He ought to be very thankful to me, do you

know. I have done a mighty good thing for him in taking you abroad;

your value is twice as great, with all the knowledge and taste that

you have acquired. A year ago, you were perhaps a little limited- a

little rustic; but now you have seen everything, and appreciated

everything, and you will be a most entertaining companion. We have

fattened the sheep for him before he kills it." Catherine turned away,

and stood staring at the blank door. "Go to bed," said her father,

"and as we don't go aboard till noon, you may sleep late. We shall

probably have a most uncomfortable voyage."
