  IF SHE HAD DISTURBED her niece's temper- she began from this

moment forward to talk a good deal about Catherine's temper, an

article which up to that time had never been mentioned in connection

with our heroine- Catherine had opportunity on the morrow to recover

her serenity. Mrs. Penniman had given her a message from Morris

Townsend to the effect that he would come and welcome her home on

the day after her arrival. He came in the afternoon; but, as may be

imagined, he was not on this occasion made free of Doctor Sloper's

study. He had been coming and going, for the past year, so comfortably

and irresponsibly, that he had a certain sense of being wronged by

finding himself reminded that he must now limit his horizon to the

front parlor, which was Catherine's particular province.

  "I am very glad you have come back," he said. "It makes me very

happy to see you again." And he looked at her, smiling, from head to

foot, though it did not appear afterward that he agreed with Mrs.

Penniman (who, womanlike, went more into details, in thinking her

embellished).

  To Catherine he appeared resplendent; it was some time before she

could believe again that this beautiful young man was her own

exclusive property. They had a great deal of characteristic lovers'

talk- a soft exchange of inquiries and assurances. In these matters

Morris had an excellent grace, which flung a picturesque interest even

over the account of his debut in the commission business- a subject as

to which his companion earnestly questioned him. From time to time

he got up from the sofa where they sat together, and walked about

the room; after which he came back, smiling and passing his hand

through his hair. He was unquiet, as was natural in a young man who

has just been reunited to a long-absent mistress, and Catherine made

the reflection that she had never seen him so excited. It gave her

pleasure, somehow, to note this fact. He asked her questions about her

travels, to some of which she was unable to reply, for she had

forgotten the names of places and the order of her father's journey.

But for the moment she was so happy, so lifted up by the belief that

her troubles at last were over, that she forgot to be ashamed of her

meager answers. It seemed to her now that she could marry him

without the remnant of a scruple, or a single tremor save those that

belonged to joy. Without waiting for him to ask, she told him that her

father had come back in exactly the same state of mind- that he had

not yielded an inch.

  "We must not expect it now," she said, "and we must do without it."

  Morris sat looking and smiling. "My poor, dear girl!" he exclaimed.

  "You mustn't pity me," said Catherine. "I don't mind it now; I am

used to it."

  Morris continued to smile, and then he got up and walked about

again. "You had better let me try him."

  "Try to bring him over? You would only make him worse," Catherine

answered, resolutely.

  "You say that because I managed it so badly before. But I should

manage it differently now. I am much wiser; I have had a year to think

of it. I have more tact."

  "Is that what you have been thinking of for a year?"

  "Much of the time. You see, the idea sticks in my crop. I don't like

to be beaten."

  "How are you beaten if we marry?"

  "Of course I am not beaten on the main issue; but I am, don't you

see, on all the rest of it- on the question of my reputation, of my

relations with your father, of my relations with my own children, if

we should have any."

  "We shall have enough for our children; we shall have enough for

everything. Don't you expect to succeed in business?"

  "Brilliantly, and we shall certainly be very comfortable. But it

isn't of the mere material comfort I speak; it is of the moral

comfort," said Morris, "of the intellectual satisfaction."

  "I have great moral comfort now," Catherine declared, very simply.

  "Of course you have. But with me it is different. I have staked my

pride on proving to your father that he is wrong, and now that I am at

the head of a flourishing business, I can deal with him as an equal, I

have a capital plan- do let me go at him!"

  He stood before her with his bright face, his jaunty air, his

hands in his pockets; and she got up, with her eyes resting on his

own. "Please don't, Morris; please don't," she said; and there was a

certain mild, sad firmness in her tone which he heard for the first

time. "We must ask no favors of him- we must ask nothing more. He

won't relent, and nothing good will come of it. I know it now- I

have a very good reason."

  "And pray what is your reason?"

  She hesitated to bring it out, but at last it came. "He is not

very fond of me."

  "Oh, bother!" cried Morris, angrily.

  "I wouldn't say such a thing without being sure. I saw it, I felt

it, in England, just before he came away. He talked to me one night-

the last night- and then it came over me. You can tell when a person

feels that way. I wouldn't accuse him if he hadn't made me feel that

way. I don't accuse him; I just tell you that that's how it is. He

can't help it; we can't govern our affections. Do I govern mine?

Mightn't he say that to me? It's because he is so fond of my mother,

whom we lost so long ago. She was beautiful, and very, very brilliant;

he is always thinking of her. I am not at all like her; Aunt

Penniman has told me that. Of course it isn't my fault; but neither is

it his fault. All I mean is, it's true; and it's a stronger reason,

for his never being reconciled than simply his dislike for you."

  "Simply'?" cried Morris, with a laugh. "I am much obliged for that."

  "I don't mind about his disliking you now; I mind everything less. I

feel differently; I feel separated from my father."

  "Upon my word," said Morris, "you are a queer family."

  "Don't say that- don't say anything unkind," the girl entreated.

"You must be very kind to me now, because, Morris, because"- and she

hesitated a moment- "because I have done a great deal for you."

  "Oh, I know that, my dear."

  She had spoken up to this moment without vehemence or outward sign

of emotion, gently, reasoningly, only trying to explain. But her

emotion had been ineffectually smothered, and it betrayed itself at

last in the trembling of her voice. "It is a great thing to be

separated like that from your father, when you have worshipped him

before. It has made me very unhappy; or it would have made me so if

I didn't love you. You can tell when a person speaks to you as if-

as if-"

  "As if what?"

  "As if they despised you!" said Catherine, passionately. "He spoke

that way the night before we sailed. It wasn't much, but it was

enough, and I thought of it on the voyage all the time. Then I made up

my mind. I will never ask him for anything again, or expect anything

from him. It would not be natural now. We must be very happy together,

and we must not seem to depend upon his forgiveness. And, Morris,

Morris, you must never despise me!"

  This was an easy promise to make, and Morris made it with fine

effect. But for the moment he undertook nothing more onerous.
