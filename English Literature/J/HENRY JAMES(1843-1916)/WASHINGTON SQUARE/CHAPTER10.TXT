  CATHERINE received the young man the next day on the ground she

had chosen- amidst the chaste upholstery of a New York drawing room

furnished in the fashion of fifty years ago. Morris had swallowed

his pride, and made the effort necessary to cross the threshold of her

too derisive parent- an act of magnanimity which could not fail to

render him doubly interesting.

  "We must settle something- we must take a line," he declared,

passing his hand through his hair and giving a glance at the long,

narrow mirror which adorned the space between the two windows, and

which had at its base a little gilded bracket covered by a thin slab

of white marble, supporting in its turn a backgammon board folded

together in the shape of two volumes- two shining folios inscribed, in

greenish-gilt letters, History of England. If Morris had been

pleased to describe the master of the house as a heartless scoffer, it

is because he thought him too much on his guard, and this was the

easiest way to express his own dissatisfaction- a dissatisfaction

which he had made a point of concealing from the doctor. It will

probably seem to the reader, however, that the doctor's vigilance

was by no means excessive, and that these two young people had an open

field. Their intimacy was now considerable, and it may appear that,

for a shrinking and retiring person, our heroine had been liberal of

her favors. The young man, within a few days, had made her listen to

things for which she had not supposed that she was prepared; having

a lively foreboding of difficulties, he proceeded to gain as much

ground as possible in the present. He remembered that fortune favors

the brave, and even if he had forgotten it, Mrs. Penniman would have

remembered it for him. Mrs. Penniman delighted of all things in a

drama, and she flattered herself that a drama would now be enacted.

Combining as she did the zeal of the prompter with the impatience of

the spectator, she had long since done her utmost to pull up the

curtain. She, too, expected to figure in the performance- to be the

confidante, the chorus, to speak the epilogue. It may even be said

that there were times when she lost sight altogether of the modest

heroine of the play in the contemplation of certain great scenes which

would naturally occur between the hero and herself.

  What Morris had told Catherine at last was simply that he loved her,

or rather adored her. Virtually, he had made known as much already-

his visits had been a series of eloquent intimations of it. But now he

had affirmed it in lover's vows, and, as a memorable sign of it, he

had passed his arm round the girl's waist and taken a kiss. This happy

certitude had come sooner than Catherine expected, and she had

regarded it, very naturally, as a priceless treasure. It may even be

doubted whether she had ever definitely expected to possess it; she

had not been waiting for it, and she had never said to herself that at

a given moment it must come. As I have tried to explain, she was not

eager and exacting; she took what was given her from day to day; and

if the delightful custom of her lover's visits, which yielded her a

happiness in which confidence and timidity were strangely blended, had

suddenly come to an end, she would not only not have spoken of herself

as one of the forsaken, but she would not have thought of herself as

one of the disappointed. After Morris had kissed her, the last time he

was with her, as a ripe assurance of his devotion, she begged him to

go away, to leave her alone, to let her think. Morris went away,

taking another kiss first. But Catherine's meditations had lacked a

certain coherence. She felt his kisses on her lips and on her cheeks

for a long time afterward; the sensation was rather an obstacle than

an aid to reflection. She would have liked to see her situation all

clearly before her, to make up her mind what she should do if, as

she feared, her father should tell her that he disapproved of Morris

Townsend. But all that she could see with any vividness was that it

was terribly strange that anyone should disapprove of him; that

there must in that case be some mistake, some mystery, which in a

little while would be set at rest. She put off deciding and

choosing; before the vision of a conflict with her father she

dropped her eyes and sat motionless, holding her breath and waiting.

It made her heart beat; it was intensely painful. When Morris kissed

her and said these things- that also made her heart beat; but this was

worse, and it frightened her. Nevertheless, today, when the young

man spoke of settling something, taking a line, she felt that it was

the truth, and she answered very simply and without hesitating.

  "We must do our duty," she said. "We must speak to my father. I will

do it tonight; you must do it tomorrow."

  "It is very good of you to do it first," Morris answered. "The young

man- the happy lover- generally does that. But just as you please."

  It pleased Catherine to think that she should be brave for his sake,

and in her satisfaction she even gave a little smile. "Women have more

tact," she said. "They ought to do it first. They are more

conciliating; they can persuade better."

  "You will need all your powers of persuasion. But, after all,"

Morris added, "you are irresistible."

  "Please don't speak that way- and promise me this: Tomorrow, when

you talk with Father, you will be very gentle and respectful."

  "As much so as possible," Morris promised. "It won't be much use,

but I shall try. I certainly would rather have you easily than have to

fight for you."

  "Don't talk about fighting; we shall not fight."

  "Ah, we must be prepared," Morris rejoined, "you especially, because

for you it must come hardest. Do you know the first thing your

father will say to you?"

  "No, Morris; please tell me."

  "He will tell you I am mercenary."

  "Mercenary!"

  "It's a big word, but it means a low thing. It means that I am after

your money."

  "Oh!" murmured Catherine, softly.

  The exclamation was so deprecating and touching that Morris indulged

in another little demonstration of affection. "But he will be sure

to say it," he added.

  "It will be easy to be prepared for that," Catherine said. "I

shall simply say that he is mistaken- that other men may be that

way, but that you are not."

  "You must make a great point of that, for it will be his own great

point."

  Catherine looked at her lover a minute, and then she said, "I

shall persuade him. But I am glad we shall be rich," she added.

  Morris turned away, looking into the crown of his hat. "No, it's a

misfortune," he said at last. "It is from that our difficulty will

come."

  "Well, if it is the worst misfortune, we are not so unhappy. Many

people would not think it so bad. I will persuade him, and after

that we shall be very glad we have money."

  Morris Townsend listened to this robust logic in silence. "I will

leave my defense to you; it's a charge that a man has to stoop to

defend himself from."

  Catherine on her side was silent for awhile; she was looking at

him while he looked, with a good deal of fixedness, out of the window.

"Morris," she said, abruptly, "are you very sure you love me?"

  He turned round, and in a moment he was bending over her. "My own

dearest, can you doubt it?"

  "I have only known it five days," she said, "but now it seems to

me as if I could never do without it."

  "You will never be called upon to try." And he gave a little tender,

reassuring laugh. Then, in a moment, he added, "There is something you

must tell me, too." She had closed her eyes after the last words she

uttered, and kept them closed; and at this she nodded her head,

without opening them. "You must tell me," he went on, "that if your

father is dead against me, if he absolutely forbids our marriage,

you will still be faithful."

  Catherine opened her eyes, gazing at him, and she could give no

better promise than what he read there.

  "You will cleave to me?" said Morris. "You know you are your own

mistress- you are of age."

  "Ah, Morris!" she murmured, for all answer; or rather not for all,

for she put her hand into his own. He kept it awhile, and presently he

kissed her again. This is all that need be recorded of their

conversation; but Mrs. Penniman, if she had been present, would

probably have admitted that it was as well it had not taken place

beside the fountain in Washington Square.
