  THE DOCTOR of course, on his return, had a good deal of talk with

his sisters. He was at no great pains to narrate his travels or to

communicate his impressions of distant lands to Mrs. Penniman, upon

whom he contented himself with bestowing a memento of his enviable

experience in the shape of a velvet gown. But he conversed with her at

some length about matters nearer home, and lost no time in assuring

her that he was still an inflexible father.

  "I have no doubt you have seen a great deal of Mr. Townsend, and

done your best to console him for Catherine's absence," he said. "I

don't ask you and you needn't deny it. I wouldn't put the question

to you for the world, and expose you to the inconvenience of having

to- a- excogitate an answer. No one has betrayed you, and there has

been no spy upon your proceedings. Elizabeth has told no tales, and

has never mentioned you except to praise your good looks and good

spirits. The thing is simply an inference of my own- an induction,

as the philosophers say. It seems to me likely that you would have

offered an asylum to an interesting sufferer. Mr. Townsend has been

a good deal in the house; there is something in the house that tells

me so. We doctors, you know, end by acquiring fine perceptions, and it

is impressed upon my sensorium that he has sat in these chairs, in a

very easy attitude, and warmed himself at that fire. I don't grudge

him the comfort of it; it is the only one he will ever enjoy at my

expense. It seems likely, indeed, that I shall be able to economize at

his own. I don't know what you may have said to him, or what you may

say hereafter; but I should like you to know that if you have

encouraged him to believe that he will gain anything by hanging on, or

that I have budged a hairbreadth from the position I took up a year

ago, you have played him a trick for which he may exact reparation.

I'm not sure that he may not bring a suit against you. Of course you

have done it conscientiously; you have made yourself believe that I

can be tired out. This is the most baseless hallucination that ever

visited the brain of a genial optimist. I am not in the least tired; I

am as fresh as when I started; I am good for fifty years yet.

Catherine appears not to have budged an inch either; she is equally

fresh; so we are about where we were before. This, however, you know

as well as I. What I wish is simply to give you notice of my own state

of mind. Take it to heart, dear Lavinia. Beware of the just resentment

of a deluded fortune hunter!"

  "I can't say I expected it," said Mrs. Penniman. "And I had a sort

of foolish hope that you would come home without that odious

ironical tone with which you treat the most sacred subjects."

  "Don't undervalue irony; it is often of great use. It is not,

however, always necessary, and I will show you how gracefully I can

lay it aside. I should like to know whether you think Morris

Townsend will hang on?"

  "I will answer you with your own weapons," said Mrs. Penniman.

"You had better wait and see."

  "Do you call such a speech as that one of my own weapons? I never

said anything so rough."

  "He will hang on long enough to make you very uncomfortable, then."

  "My dear Lavinia," exclaimed the doctor, "do you call that irony?

I call it pugilism."

  Mrs. Penniman, however, in spite of her pugilism, was a good deal

frightened, and she took counsel of her fears. Her brother meanwhile

took counsel, with many reservations, of Mrs. Almond, to whom he was

no less generous than to Lavinia, and a good deal more communicative.

  "I suppose she has had him there all the while," he said. "I must

look into the state of my wine. You needn't mind telling me now; I

have already said all I mean to say to her on the subject."

  "I believe he was in the house a good deal," Mrs. Almond answered.

"But you must admit that your leaving Lavinia quite alone was a

great change for her, and that it was natural she should want some

society."

  "I do admit that, and that is why I shall make no row about the

wine; I shall set it down as compensation to Lavinia. She is capable

of telling me that she drank it all herself. Think of the

inconceivable bad taste, in the circumstances, of that fellow making

free with the house- or coming there at all! If that doesn't

describe him, he is indescribable."

  "His plan is to get what he can. Lavinia will have supported him a

year," said Mrs. Almond. "It's so much gained."

  "She will have to support him for the rest of his life, then," cried

the doctor, "but without wine, as they say at the tables d'hote."

  "Catherine tells me he has set up a business, and is making a

great deal of money."

  The doctor stared. "She has not told me that- and Lavinia didn't

deign. Ah!" he cried, "Catherine has given me up. Not that it matters,

for all that the business amounts to."

  "She has not given up Mr. Townsend," said Mrs. Almond. "I saw that

in the first half-minute. She has come home exactly the same."

  "Exactly the same; not a grain more intelligent. She didn't notice a

stick or a stone all the while we were away- not a picture nor a view,

not a statue nor a cathedral."

  "How could she notice? She had other things to think of; they are

never for an instant out of her mind. She touches me very much."

  "She would touch me if she didn't irritate me. That's the effect she

has upon me now. I have tried everything upon her; I really have

been quite merciless. But it is of no use whatever; she is

absolutely glued. I have passed, in consequence, into the

exasperated stage. At first I had a good deal of a certain genial

curiosity about it; I wanted to see if she really would stick. But,

good Lord, one's curiosity is satisfied! I see she is capable of it,

and now she can let go."

  "She will never let go," said Mrs. Almond.

  "Take care, or you will exasperate me too. If she doesn't let go,

she will be shaken off- sent tumbling into the dust. That's a nice

position for my daughter. She can't see that if you are going to be

pushed, you had better jump. And then she will complain of her

bruises."

  "She will never complain," said Mrs. Almond.

  "That I shall object to even more. But the deuce will be that I

can't prevent anything."

  "If she is to have a fall," said Mrs. Almond, with a gentle laugh,

"we must spread as many carpets as we can." And she carried out this

idea by showing a great deal of motherly kindness to the girl.

  Mrs. Penniman immediately wrote to Morris Townsend. The intimacy

between these two was by this time consummate, but I must content

myself with noting but a few of its features. Mrs. Penniman's own

share in it was a singular sentiment, which might have been

misinterpreted, but which in itself was not discreditable to the

poor lady. It was a romantic interest in this attractive and

unfortunate young man, and yet it was not such an interest as

Catherine might have been jealous of. Mrs. Penniman had not a particle

of jealousy of her niece. For herself, she felt as if she were

Morris's mother or sister- a mother or sister of an emotional

temperament- and she had an absorbing desire to make him comfortable

and happy. She had striven to do so during the year that her brother

left her an open field, and her efforts had been attended with the

success that has been pointed out. She had never had a child of her

own, and Catherine, whom she had done her best to invest with the

importance that would naturally belong to a youthful Penniman, had

only partly rewarded her zeal. Catherine, as an object of affection

and solicitude, had never had that picturesque charm which (as it

seemed to her) would have been a natural attribute of her own progeny.

Even the maternal passion in Mrs. Penniman would have been romantic

and factitious, and Catherine was not constituted to inspire a

romantic passion. Mrs. Penniman was as fond of her as ever, but she

had grown to feel that with Catherine she lacked opportunity.

Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she had (though she had not

disinherited her niece) adopted Morris Townsend, who gave her

opportunity in abundance. She would have been very happy to have a

handsome and tyrannical son, and would have taken an extreme

interest in his love affairs. This was the light in which she had come

to regard Morris, who had conciliated her at first, and made his

impression by his delicate and calculated deference- a sort of

exhibition to which Mrs. Penniman was particularly sensitive. He had

largely abated his deference afterward, for he economized his

resources, but the impression was made, and the young man's very

brutality came to have a sort of filial value. If Mrs. Penniman had

had a son, she would probably have been afraid of him, and at this

stage of our narrative she was certainly afraid of Morris Townsend.

This was one of the results of his domestication in Washington Square.

He took his ease with her- as, for that matter, he would certainly

have done with his own mother.
