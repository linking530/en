  HE HAD BEEN PUZZLED by the way that Catherine carried herself; her

attitude at this sentimental crisis seemed to him unnaturally passive.

She had not spoken to him again after that scene in the library, the

day before his interview with Morris; and a week had elapsed without

making any change in her manner. There was nothing in it that appealed

for pity, and he was even a little disappointed at her not giving

him an opportunity to make up for his harshness by some

manifestation of liberality which should operate as a compensation. He

thought a little of offering to take her for a tour in Europe; but

he was determined to do this only in case she should seem mutely to

reproach him. He had an idea that she would display a talent for

mute reproaches, and he was surprised at not finding himself exposed

to these silent batteries. She said nothing, either tacitly or

explicitly, and as she was never very talkative, there was now no

especial eloquence in her reserve. And poor Catherine was not sulky- a

style of behavior for which she had too little histrionic talent-

she was simply very patient. Of course she was thinking over her

situation, and she was apparently doing so in a deliberate and

unimpassioned manner, with a view of making the best of it.

  "She will do as I have bidden her," said the doctor; and he made the

further reflection that his daughter was not a woman of a great

spirit.

  I know not whether he had hoped for a little more resistance for the

sake of a little more entertainment; but he said to himself, as he had

said before, that though it might have its momentary alarms, paternity

was, after all, not an exciting vocation.

  Catherine meanwhile had made a discovery of a very different sort;

it had become vivid to her that there was a great excitement in trying

to be a good daughter. She had an entirely new feeling, which may be

described as a state of expectant suspense about her own actions.

She watched herself as she would have watched another person, and

wondered what she would do. It was as if this other person, who was

both herself and not herself, had suddenly sprung into being,

inspiring her with a natural curiosity as to the performance of

untested functions.

  "I am glad I have such a good daughter," said her father, kissing

her, after the lapse of several days.

  "I am trying to be good," she answered, turning away, with a

conscience not altogether clear.

  "If there is anything you would like to say to me, you know you must

not hesitate. You needn't feel obliged to be so quiet. I shouldn't

care that Mr. Townsend should be a frequent topic of conversation, but

whenever you have anything particular to say about him I shall be very

glad to hear it."

  "Thank you," said Catherine, "I have nothing particular at present."

  He never asked her whether she had seen Morris again, because he was

sure that if this had been the case she would tell him. She had, in

fact, not seen him; she had only written him a long letter. The

letter, at least, was long for her; and, it may be added, that it

was long for Morris; it consisted of five pages, in a remarkably

neat and handsome hand. Catherine's handwriting was beautiful, and she

was even a little proud of it: She was extremely fond of copying,

and possessed volumes of extracts which testified to this

accomplishment; volumes which she had exhibited one day to her

lover, when the bliss of feeling that she was important in his eyes

was exceptionally keen. She told Morris, in writing, that her father

had expressed the wish that she should not see him again, and that she

begged he would not come to the house until she should have "made up

her mind." Morris replied with a passionate epistle, in which he asked

to what, in heaven's name, she wished to make up her mind. Had not her

mind been made up two weeks before, and could it be possible that

she entertained the idea of throwing him off? Did she mean to break

down at the very beginning of their ordeal, after all the promises

of fidelity she had both given and extracted? And he gave an account

of his own interview with her father- an account not identical at

all points with that offered in these pages. "He was terribly

violent," Morris wrote, "but you know my self-control. I have need

of it all when I remember that I have it in my power to break in

upon your cruel captivity." Catherine sent him, in answer to this, a

note of three lines. "I am in great trouble; do not doubt of my

affection, but let me wait a little and think." The idea of a struggle

with her father, of setting up her will against his own, was heavy

on her soul, and it kept her quiet, as a great physical weight keeps

us motionless. It never entered into her mind to throw her lover

off; but from the first she tried to assure herself that there would

be a peaceful way out of their difficulty. The assurance was vague,

for it contained no element of positive conviction that her father

would change his mind. She only had an idea that if she should be very

good, the situation would in some mysterious manner improve. To be

good she must be patient, outwardly submissive, abstain from judging

her father too harshly, and from committing any act of open

defiance. He was perhaps right, after all, to think as he did; by

which Catherine meant not in the least that his judgment of Morris's

motives in seeking to marry her was perhaps a just one, but that it

was probably natural and proper that conscientious parents should be

suspicious and even unjust. There were probably people in the world as

bad as her father supposed Morris to be, and if there were the

slightest chance of Morris being one of these sinister persons, the

doctor was right in taking it into account. Of course he could not

know what she knew- how the purest love and truth were seated in the

young man's eyes; but heaven, in its time, might appoint a way of

bringing him to such knowledge. Catherine expected a good deal of

heaven, and referred to the skies the initiative, as the French say,

in dealing with her dilemma. She could not imagine herself imparting

any kind of knowledge to her father; there was something superior even

in his injustice, and absolute in his mistakes. But she could at least

be good, and if she were only good enough, heaven would invent some

way of reconciling all things- the dignity of her father's errors

and the sweetness of her own confidence, the strict performance of her

filial duties, and the enjoyment of Morris Townsend's affection.

  Poor Catherine would have been glad to regard Mrs. Penniman as an

illuminating agent, a part which this lady herself, indeed, was but

imperfectly prepared to play. Mrs. Penniman took too much satisfaction

in the sentimental shadows of this little drama to have, for the

moment, any great interest in dissipating them. She wished the plot to

thicken, and the advice that she gave her niece tended, in her own

imagination, to produce this result. It was rather incoherent counsel,

and from one day to another it contradicted itself; but it was

pervaded by an earnest desire that Catherine should do something

striking. "You must act, my dear; in your situation the great thing is

to act," said Mrs. Penniman, who found her niece altogether beneath

her opportunities. Mrs. Penniman's real hope was that the girl would

make a secret marriage, at which she should officiate as brideswoman

or duenna. She had a vision of this ceremony being performed in some

subterranean chapel- subterranean chapels in New York were not

frequent, but Mrs. Penniman's imagination was not chilled by

trifles- and of the guilty couple- she liked to think of poor

Catherine and her suitor as the guilty couple- being shuffled away

in a fast-whirling vehicle to some obscure lodging in the suburbs,

where she would pay them (in a thick veil) clandestine visits; where

they would endure a period of romantic privation; and when ultimately,

after she should have been their earthly providence, their

intercessor, their advocate, and their medium of communication with

the world, they would be reconciled to her brother in an artistic

tableau, in which she herself should be somehow the central figure.

She hesitated as yet to recommend this course to Catherine, but she

attempted to draw an attractive picture of it to Morris Townsend.

She was in daily communication with the young man, whom she kept

informed by letters of the state of affairs in Washington Square. As

he had been banished, as she said, from the house, she no longer saw

him; but she ended by writing to him that she longed for an interview.

This interview could take place only on neutral ground, and she

bethought herself greatly before selecting a place of meeting. She had

an inclination for Greenwood Cemetery, but she gave it up as too

distant; she could not absent herself for so long, as she said,

without exciting suspicion. Then she thought of the Battery, but

that was rather cold and windy, besides one's being exposed to

intrusion from the Irish immigrants who at this point alight, with

large appetites, in the New World; and at last she fixed upon an

oyster saloon in the Seventh Avenue, kept by a Negro- an establishment

of which she knew nothing save that she had noticed it in passing. She

made an appointment with Morris Townsend to meet him there, and she

went to the tryst at dusk, enveloped in an impenetrable veil. He

kept her waiting for half an hour- he had almost the whole width of

the city to traverse- but she liked to wait, it seemed, to intensify

the situation. She ordered a cup of tea, which proved excessively bad,

and this gave her a sense that she was suffering in a romantic

cause. When Morris at last arrived, they sat together for half an hour

in the duskiest corner of the back shop; and it is hardly too much

to say that this was the happiest half hour that Mrs. Penniman had

known for years. The situation was really thrilling, and it scarcely

seemed to her a false note when her companion asked for an oyster

stew, and proceeded to consume it before her eyes. Morris, indeed,

needed all the satisfaction that stewed oysters could give him, for it

may be intimated to the reader that he regarded Mrs. Penniman in the

light of a fifth wheel to his coach. He was in a state of irritation

natural to a gentleman of fine parts who had been snubbed in a

benevolent attempt to confer a distinction upon a young woman of

inferior characteristics, and the insinuating sympathy of this

somewhat desiccated matron appeared to offer him no practical

relief. He thought her a humbug, and he judged of humbugs with a

good deal of confidence. He had listened and made himself agreeable to

her at first, in order to get a footing in Washington Square; and at

present he needed all his self-command to be decently civil. It

would have gratified him to tell her that she was a fantastic old

woman, and that he would like to put her into an omnibus and send

her home. We know, however, that Morris possessed the virtue of

self-control, and he had moreover the constant habit of seeking to

be agreeable; so that, although Mrs. Penniman's demeanor only

exasperated his already unquiet nerves, he listened to her with a

somber deference in which she found much to admire.
