Circe</H1></CENTER>
<I>The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled
transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and
danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with
faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and
women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal
and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of
the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under
a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer</I>.

<P>THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.

<P>THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

<P>(<I>A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling,
jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons
him</I>.)

<P>THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.

<P>THE IDIOT (<I>Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.</I>) Grhahute!

<P>THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

<P>THE IDIOT (<I>Gobbing.</I>) Ghaghahest.

<P>(<I>They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung
between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled
by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again.
On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack
of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last
bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked
cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her
lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls
sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken
navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At
a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters,
loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a
man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a
room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from
the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings
shrill from a lane</I>.)

(<I>Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters,
as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths
a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts</I>.)

(<I>Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy
the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends
him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face</I>.)

<P>STEPHEN <I>Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.</I>

<P>(<I>The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway</I>.)

<P>THE BAWD (<I>Her voice whispering huskily.</I>) Sst! Come here till
I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista</I>.

<P>THE BAWD (<I>Spits in their trail her jet of venom.</I>) Trinity medicals.
Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

<P>(<I>Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her
shawl across her nostrils</I>.)

<P>EDY BOARDMAN (<I>Bickering.</I>) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful
place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed
hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen
me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her!
Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows
the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Triumphaliter</I>.) <I>Salvi facti i sunt</I>.

<P>(<I>He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering
light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after
him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.</I>)

<P>LYNCH So that?

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Looks behind</I>.) So that gesture, not music, not odours,
would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not
the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

<P>LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

<P>STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even
the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

<P>LYNCH Ba!

<P>STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?
This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold
my stick.

<P>LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

<P>STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to <I>la belle dame sans merci</I>, Georgina
Johnson, <I>ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam</I>.

<P>(<I>Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands,
his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned
in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher</I>.)

<P>LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse.
Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

<P>(<I>They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs
in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb.
The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark.
The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and
ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering
the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.</I>

<P><I>Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools,
middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond
the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves
the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under
the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate
into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait
shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents
to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level
Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of</I> <I>truculent Wellington
but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops
of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.</I>

<P><I>At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright
arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

<P>(<I>He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming
rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing
Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing
a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with
wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses
a parcel against his rib and groans</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

<P>(<I>He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset
siding. The glow leaps again</I>.)

<P>BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

<P>(<I>He stands at Cormack's corner watching</I>.)

<P>BLOOM <I>Aurora borealis</I> or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of
course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush.
We're safe. (<I>He hums cheerfully</I>.) London's burning, London's burning!
On fire, on fire! (<I>He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the
crowd at the farther side of Talbot street</I>.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick.
Better cross here.

<P>(<I>He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout</I>.)

<P>THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (<I>Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns
aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling</I>.)

<P>THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Halts erect stung by a spasm</I>.) Ow.

<P>(<I>He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog</I> <I>a
dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him,
its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman
bangs his footgong</I>.)

<P>THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

<P>(<I>The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved
hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward,
pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys</I>.)

<P>THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes
a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand</I>.) No thoroughfare.
Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises
again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential.
(<I>He feels his trouser pocket</I>.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily
catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria
peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick.
Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might
be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style
of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken
in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem
of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (<I>He closes his
eyes an instant</I>.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other.
Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

<P>(<I>A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall,
a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero
the figure regards him with evil eye</I>.)

<P>BLOOM <I>Buenos noches, se&ntilde;orita Blanca, que calle es esta?</I>

<P>THE FIGURE (<I>Impassive, raises a signal arm</I>.) Password. <I>Sraid
Mabbot</I>.

<P>BLOOM Haha. <I>Merci</I>. Esperanto. <I>Slan leath. (He mutters</I>.)
Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

<P>(<I>He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps
left, ragsackman left</I>.)

<P>BLOOM I beg. (<I>He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted
by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost
my way and contributed to the columns of the <I>Irish Cyclist</I> the letter
headed, In <I>darkest Stepaside</I>. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags
and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes
for. Wash off his sins of the world.

<P>(<I>Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom</I>.)

<P>BLOOM O!

<P>(<I>Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.
Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket,
sweets of sin, potato soap</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch
your purse.

<P>(<I>The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled
form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan
of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles
hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn
face</I>.)

<P>RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken
goy ever. So. You catch no money.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen,
feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi</I>.

<P>RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (<I>With
feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face</I> <I>of Bloom</I>) Are
you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son
Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers
Abraham and Jacob?

<P>BLOOM (<I>With precaution</I>.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All
that's left of him.

<P>RUDOLPH (<I>Severely</I>.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog
after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

<P>BLOOM (<I>In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered,
in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch
and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with
stiffening mud</I>.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

<P>RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make
you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Weakly</I>.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy.
I slipped.

<P>RUDOLPH (<I>With contempt) Ooim nachez</I>. Nice spectacles for your
poor mother!

<P>BLOOM Mamma!

<P>ELLEN BLOOM (<I>In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle,
widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens
and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase
banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm</I>.)
O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (<I>She
hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat.
A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out</I>.)
Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

<P>(<I>Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels
in his filled pockets but desists, muttering</I>.)

<P>A VOICE (<I>Sharply</I>.) Poldy!

<P>BLOOM Who? (<I>He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily</I>.) At your
service.

<P>(<I>He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in
Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet
trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles
her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free
only her lace dark eyes and raven hair</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Molly!

<P>MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak
to me. (<I>Satirically</I>.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so
long?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Shifts from foot to foot</I>.) No, no. Not the least little
bit.

<P>(<I>He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions,
hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound.
A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles
are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a
turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his
bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely
she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him
in Moorish</I>.)

<P>MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

<P>(<I>The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit,
offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his
head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops
his back for leapfrog</I>.)

<P>BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion...
if you...

<P>MARION So you notice some change? (<I>Her hands passing slowly over
her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes</I>.) O Poldy,
Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide
world.

<P>BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water.
Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (<I>He
pats divers pockets</I>.) This moving kidney. Ah!

<P>(<I>He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon
soap arises, diffusing light and perfume</I>.)

<P>THE SOAP
<BLOCKQUOTE>We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
<BR>He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.</BLOCKQUOTE>
(<I>The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appeals in the disc of the
soapsun</I>.)

<P>SWENY Three and a penny, please.

<P>BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

<P>MARION (<I>Softly</I>.) Poldy!

<P>BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

<P>MARION <I>Ti trema un poco il cuore?</I>

<P>(<I>In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,
humming the duet from Don Giovanni</I>)

<P>BLOOM Are you sure about that <I>Voglio?</I> I mean the pronunciati...

<P>(<I>He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes
his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering</I>.)

<P>THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.
Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

<P>(<I>She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie
Kelly stands</I>.)

<P>BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

<P>(<I>With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues
with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom.
Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker</I>.)

<P>THE BAWD (<I>Her wolfeyes shining</I>.) He's getting his pleasure. You
won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night
before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

<P>(<I>Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling,
and shows coyly her bloodied clout</I>.)

<P>GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (<I>She murmurs</I>.)
You did that. I hate you.

<P>BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

<P>THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman
false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take
the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

<P>GERTY (<I>To Bloom</I>.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.
(<I>She paws his sleeve, slobbering</I>.) Dirty married man! I love you
for doing that to me.

<P>(<I>She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with
loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen,
smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth</I>.)

<P>MRS BREEN Mr.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Coughs gravely</I>.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure
by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

<P>MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you
nicely! Scamp!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Hurriedly</I>.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think
me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since
I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having
this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting
quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Holds up a finger</I>.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know
somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (<I>Slily</I>.)
Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks behind</I>.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming.
The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello
black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore
christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

<P>(<I>Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,
upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap
out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle
the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle
through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe
heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips</I>.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>There's someone in the house with Dina
<BR>There's someone in the house, I know,
<BR>There's someone in the house with Dina
<BR>Playing on the old banjo.</BLOCKQUOTE>
(<I>They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling,
trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>With a sour tenderish smile</I>.) A little frivol, shall we,
if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for
a fraction of a second?

<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Screams gaily</I>.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

<P>BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage
mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner
for you. (<I>Gloomily</I>.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear
gazelle.

<P>MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (<I>She
puts out her hand inquisitively</I>.) What are you hiding behind your back?
Tell us, there's a dear.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Seizes her wrist with his free hand</I>.) Josie Powell that
was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking
back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's
housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the
pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

<P>MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation
and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings,
blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs,
a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand</I>.) Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

<P>MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Meaningfully dropping his voice</I>.) I confess I'm teapot
with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little
teapot at present.

<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Gushingly</I>.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot
and I'm simply teapot all over me. (<I>She rubs sides with him</I>.) After
the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the
staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his
fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which
she surrenders gently</I>.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter
out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (<I>Tenderly, as he slips on her finger
a ruby ring.) L&agrave; ci darem la mano</I>.

<P>MRS BREEN (<I>In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue,
a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her
moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio
e non</I>. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

<P>BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and
the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (<I>His clenched fist at his
brow</I>.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (<I>Hoarsely</I>.)
Woman, it's breaking me! (<I>Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom
Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard
thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in
the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter</I>.)

<P>ALF BERGAN (<I>Points jeering at the sandwich boards</I>.) U.p.: Up.

<P>MRS BREEN (<I>To Bloom</I>.) High jinks below stairs. (<I>She gives
him the glad eye</I>.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You
wanted to.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Shocked</I>.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss</I>.)
Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Off handedly</I>.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without
potted meat is incomplete. I was at <I>Leah</I>. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant

shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on
that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes
advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a
bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like
she did it on purpose...

<P>MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

<P>BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky
little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired
on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a
pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart

though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style.
She was .

<P>MRS BREEN Too.

<P>BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly
were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses,

fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I
am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully

well ashamed of yourself.

<P>BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am
a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable
married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.
My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant
upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one
of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority
for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General
Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned

<P>(<I>Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate

Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

<P>BEAUFOY (<I>Drawls</I>.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know
it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most
rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading
as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness
he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect
gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books
of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar,
are a household word throughout the kingdom.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Murmurs with hangdog meekness</I>.) That bit about the laughing
witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

<P>BEAUFOY (<I>His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court</I>.)
You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't
think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.
My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord,
we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably
out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims,
who has not even been to a university.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Indistinctly</I>.) University of life. Bad art.

<P>BEAUFOY (<I>Shouts</I>.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral

<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Indignantly</I>.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable
character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six
pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing
to his carryings on.

as poor as I am.

<P>BLOOM (<I>In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly</I>.) I treated you white.
I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously
I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in
all things. Play cricket.

<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Excitedly</I>.) As God is looking down on me this
night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

<P>FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

<P>MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour,
when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety
pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he
interfered twice with my clothing.

<P>BLOOM She counterassaulted.

<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Scornfully</I>.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush,

<P>(<I>Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in
his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though
branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve
the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as
a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully
brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been
lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now,
when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life
in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings
of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen
that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway
company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through
the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of
scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper
at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers
to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model
young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting
the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and
green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains
of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops

his nose, talks inaudibly</I>.)

<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with
a voice of pained protest</I>.) This is no place for indecent levity at
the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden
nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an
infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and
is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was
due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination,
such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted
in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. <I>Prima facie</I>,
I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy
did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue
was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism.
There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family.
If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest
that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself,
my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission
is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions.
Not all there, in fact.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic
toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly,

<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>Hotly to the populace</I>.) This is a lonehand fight.
By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this
fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded
the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing
for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory
before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person
was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (<I>Bloom
takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips</I>.) I shall call
rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again
at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately
bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly
which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took
the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had
worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him
as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the
mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia

me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the
North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch.
He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a
box of the <I>Theatre Royal</I> at a command performance of <I>La Cigale</I>.
I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct

I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage
door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap
of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop
in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss
culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a
botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of
the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to
my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial
bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped
or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves
in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden
treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged
me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the
marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards,
insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude
senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by
him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero,
evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin
with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an
unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride
and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

down the steps and accosts him</I>.)

<P>ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

<P>BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

<P>ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse.

lips</I>.)

<P>BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

<P>ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

<P>(<I>She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm,
cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note,
oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed
with kohol. His smile softens</I>.)

<P>ZOE You'll know me the next time.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Forlornly</I>.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure
to.

<P>(<I>Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes.
Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong
hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by
the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white,
still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth
roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes,
strangely murmuring</I>.)

<P>ZOE (<I>Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously
smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith

accent.

<P>ZOE And you know what thought did?

<P>(<I>She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on
him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a
sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat
awkward hand</I>.) Are you a Dublin girl?

<P>ZOE (<I>Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil</I>.)
No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

<P>BLOOM (<I>As before</I>.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish
device. (<I>Lewdly</I>.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder
of rank weed.

<P>ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

<P>BLOOM (<I>In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating
tie and apache cap</I>.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought
from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence
by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will,
understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years
before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies.

hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated
Boulevard Bloom.

<P>COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Impassionedly</I>.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen
as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?
Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses,
supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous
hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted
labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain
stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf
and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

<P>(<I>Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring
up. A streamer bearing the legends</I> Cead Mille Failte <I>and</I> Mah
Ttob Melek Israel <I>spans the street. All the windows are thronged with
sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal
Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders
and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys
from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills,
cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering.
The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance
playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted,
trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal
standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of
the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in
a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They
are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin,
the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway,
Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees
and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire
Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order
of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal
Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most
reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland,
the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist,
anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of
the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands
with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers,
law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners,
tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators,
bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters,

fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands,
bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato
factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen
of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone,
the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying
the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible.
Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of
welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson
velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb
and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone
with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall.
Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals.
The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid
the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes</I>.)

<P>(<I>Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring.
He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers
put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ

<P>BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix
hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our
former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene,
the splendour of night.

<P>(<I>The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the

<P>TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

<P>BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy
at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with
telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do
we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left
our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their
warcry, <I>Bonafide Sabaoth</I>, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

<P>BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell
you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall
ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem
in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

<P>(<I>Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland,
under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem.
It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge
pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension
several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are
temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to
the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked
in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part
of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses</I>.)

<P>THE SIGHTSEERS (<I>Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die</I>.)

<P>(<I>A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points
an elongated finger at Bloom</I>.)

<P>THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man
is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

<P>BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

<P>(<I>A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his
sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful
enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees,
are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration
medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars,
free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied
with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock</I>, billets doux <I>in

bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40</I> <I>days' indulgences,

to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through
the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great
acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings
are held up</I>.)

themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish
garters, leaping from windows of different storeys</I>.)

<P>ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (<I>Violently</I>.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites,
the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian
men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of
Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities
of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with
infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of
the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake
faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

<P>THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

<P>(<I>Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from

Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the
viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, <I>sgenl inn ban bata
coisde gan capall</I>. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex
specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

<P>DR MULLIGAN (<I>In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow</I>.)
Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's
private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy
is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis
have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of
chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely
bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake,
and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily
lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning.
I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid
test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to
be <I>virgo intacta.</I>

<P><I>(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs</I>.)

<P>DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations
I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine
in the national teratological museum.

<P>DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid.
Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

<P>DR PUNCH COSTELLO The <I>fetor judaicus</I> is most perceptible.

<P>DR DIXON (<I>Reads a bill of health</I>.) Professor Bloom is a finished
example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.
Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow
on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has
written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary
of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything.
He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on
a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas.
He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday.
He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree
reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child.
I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs
have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

<P>(<I>General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American
makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques,
banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s,
wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly
collected</I>.)

<P>(<I>Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white
children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive
plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably
dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and
interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible
letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor&eacute;e,
Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed
to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing

his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor,
luring him to doom</I>.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

<P>(<I>He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards
the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted
eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek
of all the male brutes that have possessed her</I>.)

<P>THE MALE BRUTES (<I>Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in
their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro</I>.)
Good!

<P>(<I>Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.
They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to
his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly</I>.)

<P>ZOE (<I>Her lucky hand instantly saving him</I>.) Hoopsa! Don't fall
upstairs.

<P>BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (<I>He stands aside at the threshold</I>.)
After you is good manners.

<P>ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

<P>(<I>She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding
out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall
hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them,
frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown
open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with
an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar
his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly
Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox:
then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade
of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round
a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth
mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped
over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked,
a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy.
The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In
the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged
on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand
he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,
doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her
hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing
at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset
lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple
at the piano</I>.)

<P>KITTY (<I>Coughs behind her hand</I>.) She's a bit imbecilic. (<I>She
signs with a waggling forefinger</I>.) Blemblem. (<I>Lynch lifts up her
skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly</I>.)
Respect yourself. (<I>She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under
which her hair glows, red with henna</I>.) O, excuse!

<P>ZOE More limelight, Charley. (<I>She goes to the chandelier and turns
the gas full cock</I>.)

<P>KITTY (<I>Peers at the gasjet</I>.) What ails it tonight?

<P>LYNCH (<I>Deeply</I>.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

<P>ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

<P>(<I>The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands
at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he
repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble
goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle
in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening.
A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid</I>.)

<P>KITTY (<I>Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot</I>.) O, excuse!

<P>ZOE (<I>Promptly</I>.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your
shift.

<P>(<I>Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over
her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar
on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the
squatted figure with its cap back to the front</I>.)

<P>STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an
old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate <I>C<oe>la enarrant gloriam Domini</I>.
It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian
and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's
or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his
chief bassoonist about his almightiness. <I>Mais, nom de nom, that is another
pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops,
points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs</I>.) Which side is your knowledge
bump?

<P>THE CAP (<I>With saturnine spleen</I>.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's
reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form
of life. Bah!

<P>STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.
How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

<P>THE CAP Bah!

<P>STEPHEN Here's another for you. (<I>He frowns</I>.) The reason is because
the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible
interval which .

<P>THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>With on effort</I>.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible
ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

<P>THE CAP Which? (<I>Outside the gramophone begins to blare</I> The Holy
City.)

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Abruptly</I>.) What went forth to the ends of the world
to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,
having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment.
Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself
was ineluctably preconditioned to become. <I>Ecco!</I>

<P>LYNCH (<I>With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins</I>.)

<P>ZOE (<I>Briskly</I>.) God help your head, he knows more than you have
forgotten.

<P>FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

<P>KITTY No!

<P>STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

<P>(<I>Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his
spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from
which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder
he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass
of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its
breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked,
hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose,
tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness</I>.)

<P>ALL What?

<P>THE HOBGOBLIN (<I>His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his
eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then
all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il

and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches
juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits!

<P>(<I>A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it,
proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.

whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs

harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice
with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which
the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.</I>)

right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by
its two talons</I>.)

<P>MANANAAN MACLIR (<I>With a voice of waves</I>.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub!
Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos.

<P>ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

<P>LYNCH (<I>Tossing a cigarette on to the table</I>.) Here.

<P>ZOE (<I>Her head perched aside in mock pride</I>.) Is that the way to
hand the <I>pot</I> to a lady? (<I>She stretches up to light the cigarette
over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits.
Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters
up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly
at her cigarette</I>.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

<P>LYNCH I'm not looking.

<P>ZOE (<I>Makes sheep's eyes</I>.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would
you suck a lemon?

<P>(<I>Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom,
then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue
fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling
his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and
gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate,
chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the
left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears
a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left
eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell.
On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his
ears</I>.)

<P>VIRAG (<I>Heels together bows</I>.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely.
(<I>He coughs thoughtfully, drily</I>.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in
evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that
she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular
devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

<P>BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

<P>VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse
white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood,
is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone
in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so
performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you
in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

<P>BLOOM She is rather lean.

<P>VIRAG (<I>Not unpleasantly</I>.) Absolutely! Well observed and those
pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to
suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which
a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe
the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what
you can wear today. Parallax! (<I>With a nervous twitch of his head</I>.)
Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

<P>BLOOM (<I>An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek</I>.)
She seems sad.

<P>VIRAG (<I>Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left
eye with a finger and barks hoarsely</I>.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper
and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered
by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (<I>More genially</I>.)
Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There
is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated
vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of
the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Regretfully</I>.) When you come out without your gun.

<P>VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money,
take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

<P>BLOOM With?...

<P>VIRAG (<I>His tongue upcurling</I>.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad.
She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal
in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday
soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances,
suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing
to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful
nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets
of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of
green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions
of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt
to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (<I>His throat twitches</I>.)
Slapbang! There he goes again.

<P>BLOOM The stye I dislike.

<P>VIRAG (<I>Arches his eyebrows</I>.) Contact with a goldring, they say.
<I>Argumentum ad feminam</I>, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece
in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's
sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (<I>He twitches</I>.)
It is a funny sound.

<P>(<I>He coughs encouragingly</I>.) But possibly it is only a wart. I
presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head?
Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Reflecting</I>.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax.
This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter
of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

<P>VIRAG (<I>Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking</I>.)
Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.
Exercise your mnemotechnic. <I>La causa &egrave; santa</I>. Tara. Tara.

<P>BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic
tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures.
Mnemo?

<P>VIRAG (<I>Excitedly</I>.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (<I>He
taps his parchmentroll energetically.)</I> This book tells you how to act
with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,
melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about
amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with
horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar
and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike
women in male habiliments? (<I>With a dry snigger</I>.) You intended to
devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer
months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate!
From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say?
Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated
combinations, camiknickers? (<I>He crows derisively</I>.) Keekeereekee!

<P>(<I>Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled
mauve light, hearing the everflying moth</I>.)

<P>BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence
this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is
will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

<P>VIRAG (<I>Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper</I>.) Insects of the
day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell
of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal
verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (<I>His yellow parrotbeak gabbles
nasally</I>.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year
five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey
will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice
malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time
we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (<I>He coughs and, bending
his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand</I>.) You shall
find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember
their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth
book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.
B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are
again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate
sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

gluttonously with turkey wattles</I>.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where
are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (<I>He unrolls his parchment rapidly
and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which
he claws</I>.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters
will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves
may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister
omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis.
Though they stink yet they sting. (<I>He wags head with cackling raillery</I>.)
Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Absently</I>.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always
open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet
Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy
to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way
through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like
those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to

Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep

<P>PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with
the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you
got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's
en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital,
Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

<P>PHILIP DRUNK (<I>Impatiently</I>.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid
my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality.
Who was it told me his name?

<P>(<I>His lawnmower begins to purr</I>.) Aha, yes. <I>Zoe mou sas agapo</I>.

somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne,
was it, no?

Keep in condition. Do like us.

<P>ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business
with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know
you've a Roman collar.

<P>VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (<I>Harshly,
his pupils waxing</I>.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun.
I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why
I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional.
Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (<I>He wriggles</I>.) Woman, undoing with sweet
pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short
time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy
and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with
big lingam, the stiff one. (<I>He cries.) Coactus volui</I>. Then giddy
woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites,
spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (<I>He chases
his tail</I>.) Piffpaff! Popo! (<I>He stops, sneezes.)</I> Pchp! (<I>He

<P>LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting
a bishop.

<P>ZOE (<I>Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils</I>.) He couldn't get
a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

<P>BLOOM Poor man!

<P>BLOOM How?

<P>VIRAG (<I>A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,

the pope's bastard. (<I>He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent
rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute

Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow

<P>(<I>His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,
appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven
dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping
under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs
are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs
a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing
his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims
with bloated pomp</I>.)

(<I>He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left
cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and
fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour</I>.) O, the poor
little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and
heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage
He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

<P>(<I>A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself
with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims</I>.) I'm suffering
the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny
little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face
of the bloody globe.

<P>(<I>His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers,
imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat
from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers.
The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing,
zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male,
melodious</I>.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee,
And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

<P>THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

<P>ZOE The devil is in that door.

<P>(<I>A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking
the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily
and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket
and offers it nervously to Zoe</I>.)

<P>ZOE (<I>Sniffs his hair briskly</I>.) Hum. Thank your mother for the
rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,
pricks his ears</I>.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double
event?

<P>ZOE (<I>Tears open the silverfoil</I>.) Fingers was made before forks.
(<I>She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts
and then turns kittenishly to Lynch</I>.) No objection to French lozenges?
(<I>He nods. She taunts him</I>.) Have it now or wait till you get it?
(<I>He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle.
His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her</I>.)
Catch.

<P>(<I>She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites
it through with a crack</I>.)

<P>KITTY (<I>Chewing</I>.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have
lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with
his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

<P>BLOOM (<I>In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic
forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards
the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with
impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right
arm downwards from his left shoulder</I>.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever
you are.

<P>(<I>A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.
Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly.
Zoe offers him chocolate</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Solemnly</I>.) Thanks.

<P>ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

<P>(<I>A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Takes the chocolate</I>.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla
calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus.
Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad.
Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (<I>He eats</I>.) Influence taste too, mauve.
But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better
late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

<P>(<I>The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She
is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled
selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck
in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are
deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy,
slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace
pendant beryl eardrops</I>.)

<P>BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

<P>(<I>She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom
with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face,
neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter</I>.)

<P>THE FAN (<I>Flirting quickly, then slowly</I>.) Married, I see.

<P>BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

<P>THE FAN (<I>Half opening, then closing</I>.) And the missus is master.
Petticoat government.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks down with a sheepish grin</I>.) That is so.

<P>THE FAN (<I>Folding together, rests against her eardrop</I>.) Have you
forgotten me?

<P>BLOOM Yes. No.

<P>THE FAN (<I>Folded akimbo against her waist</I>.) Is me her was you
dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the
same now we? (<I>Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Wincing</I>.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber
which women love.

<P>THE FAN (<I>Tapping</I>.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Cowed</I>.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your
domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak,
with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too
late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open
at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according
to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica
in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower,
was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of
tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David
and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A
dog's spittle, as you probably... (<I>He winces</I>.) Ah!

<P>RICHIE GOULDING (<I>Bagweighted, passes the door</I>.) Mocking is catch.
Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

<P>THE FAN (<I>Tapping</I>.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Undecided</I>.) All now? I should not have parted with my
talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my
time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

<P>THE FAN (<I>Points downwards slowly</I>.) You may.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace</I>.
) We are observed.

<P>THE FAN (<I>Points downwards quickly</I>.) You must.

<P>BLOOM (<I>With desire, with reluctance</I>.) I can make a true black
knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.
I knelt once before today. Ah!

<P>(<I>Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to
the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.
Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
draws out and in her laces</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Murmurs lovingly</I>.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was
my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace
up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly
small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily
to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

<P>THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Crosslacing</I>.) Too tight?

<P>THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

<P>BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That
night she met... Now!

<P>(<I>He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises
his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow
dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

<P>BELLO (<I>With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice</I>.) Hound
of dishonour!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Infatuated</I>.) Empress!

<P>BELLO (<I>His heavy cheekchops sagging</I>.) Adorer of the adulterous
rump!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Plaintively</I>.) Hugeness!

<P>BELLO Dungdevourer!

<P>BLOOM (<I>With sinews semiflexed</I>.) Magnificence.

<P>BELLO Down! (<I>He taps her on the shoulder with his fan</I>.) Incline
feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling.
On the hands down!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing</I>.)
Truffles!

<P>(<I>With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,
snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut
tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most
excellent master</I>.)

<P>BELLO (<I>With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his
shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport
skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in
his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in</I>.)
Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's
glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Enthralled, bleats</I>.) I promise never to disobey.

<P>BELLO (<I>Laughs loudly</I>.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in
store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!
I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek
me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to
be inflicted in gym costume.

<P>(<I>Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe</I>.

<P>ZOE (<I>Widening her slip to screen her</I>.) She's not here.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Closing her eyes</I>.) She's not here.

<P>FLORRY (<I>Hiding her with her gown</I>.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello.
She'll be good, sir.

<P>KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

<P>BELLO (<I>Coaxingly</I>.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you,
darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk,
sweety. (<I>Bloom puts out her timid head</I>.) There's a good girly now.
(<I>Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward</I>.) I only want
to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender
behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Fainting</I>.) Don't tear my.

<P>BELLO (<I>Savagely</I>.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the
hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the
Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember
me for the balance of your natural life. (<I>His forehead veins swollen,
his face congested</I>.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning
after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle
of Guinness's porter. (<I>He belches</I>.) And suck my thumping good Stock
Exchange cigar while I read the <I>Licensed Victualler's</I> Gazette. Very
possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy
a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked
like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

<P>(<I>He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

<P>BELLO (<I>Twisting</I>.) Another!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Screams</I>.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body
aches like mad!

<P>BELLO (<I>Shouts</I>.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's
the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting,
damn you. (<I>He slaps her face</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

<P>BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

<P>ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

<P>FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

<P>KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

<P>(<I>The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy

<P>MRS KEOCH (<I>Ferociously</I>.) Can I help? (<I>They hold and pinion
Bloom</I>.)

<P>BELLO (<I>Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke,
nursing a fat leg</I>.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond
Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters.
Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me
about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider <I>Throwaway</I>
at twenty to one. (<I>He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear</I>.)
Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Goaded, buttocksmothered</I>.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

<P>BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never
prayed before. (<I>He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar</I>.) Here,
kiss that. Both. Kiss. (<I>He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's
knees, calls in a hard voice</I>.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross.
I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (<I>He bends sideways and squeezes
his mount's testicles roughly, shouting</I>.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse
you in proper fashion. (<I>He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle</I>.)
The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the
gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

<P>FLORRY (<I>Pulls at Bello</I>.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I
asked before you.

<P>ZOE (<I>Pulling at Florry</I>.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him
yet, suckeress?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Stifling</I>.) Can't.

<P>BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (<I>He holds in his breath</I>.) Curse it.
Here. This bung's about burst. (<I>He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
his features, farts loudly</I>.) Take that! (<I>He recorks himself</I>)
Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

<P>BLOOM (<I>A sweat breaking out over him</I>.) Not man. (<I>He sniffs</I>.)
Woman.

<P>BELLO (<I>Stands up</I>.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed
for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest,
a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your
male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously
rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Shrinks</I>.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must
I tip-touch it with my nails?

<P>BELLO (<I>Points to his whores</I>.) As they are now, so will you be,
wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits.
Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with
cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone
busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your
figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks,
pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course,
with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent
for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little
chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness

male hands and nose, leering mouth</I>.) I tried her things on only once,
a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save
the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

<P>BELLO (<I>Jeers</I>.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and
showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn
blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender,
eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short
trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs
Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

<P>BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

<P>BELLO (<I>Guffaws</I>.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You
were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and
lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated
by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor
Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury
of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&amp;Aelig;sus, the varsity
wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs,
dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (<I>He guffaws again</I>.) Christ, wouldn't
it make a Siamese cat laugh?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Her hands and features working</I>.) It was Gerald converted
me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High
School play <I>Vice Versa</I>. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated
by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds
his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

<P>BELLO (<I>With wicked glee</I>.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When
you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on
the smoothworn throne.

<P>BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (<I>Earnestly</I>.)
And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

<P>BELLO (<I>Sternly</I>.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in
the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing,
sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your
swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The
sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

<P>THE SINS OF THE PAST (<I>In a medley of voices</I>.) He went through
a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of
the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to
the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal
strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached
to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages
offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively
smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting
couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in
bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet
paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and
a postal order?

<P>(<I>He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall</I>.)

<P>BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes,
also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned
up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (<I>He places
a ruby ring on her finger</I>.) And there now! With this ring I thee own.
Say, thank you, mistress.

<P>BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

<P>BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in
the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one.
Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.
Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you
on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,
with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your
wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered
with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights
of old laid down their lives. (<I>He chuckles</I>.) My boys will be no
end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come
here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded
heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named
Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman
out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of
all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What
offers? (<I>He points</I>.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and
carry, basket in mouth. (<I>He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in
Bloom's vulva</I>.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you
a hardon? (<I>He shoves his arm in a bidder's face</I>.) Here, wet the
deck and wipe it round!

<P>A BIDDER A florin!

<P>CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

<P>BELLO (<I>Gives a rap with his gavel</I>.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure
and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points.
Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If
I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid
gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's
milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa,
my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (<I>He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup</I>.)
So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

<P>A DARKVISAGED MAN (<I>In disguised accent</I>.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

<P>VOICES (<I>Subdued</I>.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

<P>BELLO (<I>Gaily</I>.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly
short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette,
is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the
long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts
of the <I>blas&eacute;</I> man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk
on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the
thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination
to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger
in mouth</I>.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

<P>BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (<I>He
stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds
of Bloom's haunches</I>.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's
your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy,
sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy

<P>BELLO (<I>Sarcastically</I>.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the
world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned,
my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well
for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts
all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee,
belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he
has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months,
my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts
already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (<I>He spits
in contempt</I>.) Spittoon!

<P>BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds.
Unmentionable. I.

a Mullingar student.

<P>BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote,
Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and
his men friends are living there in clover. <I>The Cuckoos' Rest!</I> Why
not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot,
exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless
dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander,
O.

<P>BLOOM They... I

<P>BELLO (<I>Cuttingly</I>.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette
carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp
to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue
you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate
the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook
of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling
brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our
shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my

a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the

<P>THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster
picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh
tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act,
the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of
rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb
callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary
articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman.
Useful hints to the married.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Lifts a turtle head towards her lap</I>.) We have met before.
On another star.

<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Sadly</I>.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied

testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed
four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

<P>BLOOM You mean <I>Photo Bits?</I>

<P>THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four
places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Humbly kisses her long hair</I>.) Your classic curves, beautiful
immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,
almost to pray.

<P>THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Quickly</I>.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the
worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of
my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the
rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some
days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive
vent. (<I>He sighs</I>.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Her fingers in her ears</I>.) And words. They are not
in my dictionary.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Reflects precautiously</I>.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't
her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after
weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed

Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the
nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (<I>The fleeing nymph
raises a keen</I>.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind
me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool
someone else, not me. (<I>He sniffs</I>.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur.
Grease.

<P>(<I>The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him</I>.)

<P>BELLA You'll know me the next time.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Composed, regards her.) Pass&eacute;e</I>. Mutton dressed
as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last
thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin
drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They
have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple
screw propeller.

<P>BELLA (<I>Contemptuously</I>.) You're not game, in fact. (<I>Her sowcunt
barks</I>.) Fohracht!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Contemptuously</I>.) Clean your nailless middle finger first,
the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful
of hay and wipe yourself.

<P>BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

<P>BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

<P>BELLA (<I>Turns to the piano</I>.) Which of you was playing the dead
march from <I>Saul?</I>

<P>ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (<I>She darts to the piano and bangs
chords on it with crossed arms</I>.) The cat's ramble through the slag.

darts back to the table</I>.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my

<P>STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

<P>ZOE Here. (<I>She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh
and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking</I>.) Those that hides

<P>BELLA (<I>Frowns</I>.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't
you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

<P>(<I>She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking
out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her</I>.)

<P>STEPHEN (With <I>exaggerated politeness</I>.) This silken purse I made
out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me.

Kinch and Lynch. <I>Dans ce bordel o&ugrave; tenons nostre &eacute;tat</I>.

<P>LYNCH (<I>Calls from the hearth</I>.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing
for me.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Hands Bella a coin</I>.) Gold. She has it.

<P>BELLA (<I>Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty</I>.) Do
you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Delightedly</I>.) A hundred thousand apologies. (<I>He fumbles

my sight is somewhat troubled.

<P>(<I>Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to
himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over
Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist,
adds his head to the group</I>.)

a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink...
it's long after eleven.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence</I>.) No
bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

<P>ZOE (<I>Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the
top of her stocking</I>.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

<P>LYNCH (<I>Lifting Kitty from the table</I>.) Come!

<P>KITTY Wait. (<I>She clutches the two crowns</I>.)

<P>FLORRY And me?

<P>LYNCH Hoopla! (<I>He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the

<P>BLOOM (<I>Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and
Florry</I>.) So. Allow me. (<I>He takes up the pound note</I>.) Three times
ten. We're square.

<P>BELLA (<I>Admiringly</I>.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could
kiss you.

<P>ZOE (<I>Points</I>.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (<I>Lynch bends Kitty
back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen</I>.)

<P>BLOOM This is yours.

<P>STEPHEN How is that? <I>Le distrait</I> or absentminded beggar. (<I>He
fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object
falls</I>.) That fell.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches</I>.) This.

<P>STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Quietly</I>.) You had better hand over that cash to me to
take care of. Why pay more?

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Hands him all his coins</I>.) Be just before you are generous.

<P>BLOOM I will but is it wise? (<I>He counts</I>.) One, seven, eleven,
and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

<P>STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing
says. Thirsty fox. (<I>He laughs loudly</I>.) Burying his grandmother.
Probably he killed her.

<P>BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

<P>STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

<P>BLOOM No, but...

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Comes to the table</I>.) Cigarette, please. (<I>Lynch tosses
a cigarette from the sofa to the table</I>.) And so Georgina Johnson is
dead and married. (<I>A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at
it</I>.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (<I>He strikes a match and
proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy</I>.)

<P>LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it
if you held the match nearer.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Brings the match nearer his eye</I>.) Lynx eye. Must get
glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees
all flat. (<I>He draws the match away. It goes out</I>.) Brain thinks.
Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (<I>He frowns mysteriously</I>.)
Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

<P>ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with
him.

<P>FLORRY (<I>Nods</I>.) Mr Lambe from London.

<P>STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

<P>LYNCH (<I>Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem</I>.

it into the grate</I>.)

<P>FLORRY What?

<P>(<I>A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked

<P>ZOE (<I>Turns the drumhandle</I>.) There.

<P>(<I>She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start
forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin,
in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape,
bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering.
He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of
arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing</I>.)

<P>(<I>The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude
to</I> My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. <I>Stephen throws his ashplant on the
table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table
towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins
to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals
a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains,
Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat.
With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates
in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream
tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight
lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is
a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges
it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows
and fondles his flower and buttons</I>.)

<P>MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with
Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment.

<P><I>(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels,
shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz
time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade,
gold, rose, violet</I>.)

girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

<P>(<I>From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish

their arms</I>.)

her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly,
pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives
a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the
halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car
with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall
uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher
replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey.
Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his
caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face.

VOICES Police!

<P>DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

<P>(<I>Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling
guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse
commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns
hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves
rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands,
swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks,
climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls,
albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles.
The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats
and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with
a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches,
arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the
void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes
they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy
clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts
above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty
sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters.
It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange
in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry
sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel
O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell,
Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny,
lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of
the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre
of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise
from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower
two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone
Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice
resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat
and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates
camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and
mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants
head an open umbrella</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Runs to Lynch</I>.) Can't you get him away?

<P>LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (<I>To Bloom</I>.)
Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (<I>He drags Kitty away</I>.)

He insulted me but I forgive him. (<I>Shouting in his ear</I>.) I forgive

<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Breaks loose.)</I> I'll insult him.

<P>(<I>He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in
the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his
face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it
up</I>.)

<P>PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted
my chum. (<I>The retriever barks</I>.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>With expectation</I>.) Is he bleeding?

<P>A MAN (<I>Rising from his knees</I>.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all
right.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Glances sharply at the man</I>.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

<P>SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Lurches towards the watch</I>.) He insulted my lady
friend.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Angrily</I>.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness.
Constable, take his regimental number.

<P>SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty.
PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>Pulling his comrade</I>.) Here, bugger off, Harry.
Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Staggering as he is pulled away</I>.) God fuck old
Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Taking out his notebook</I>.) What's his name?

<P>BLOOM (<I>Peering over the crowd</I>.) I just see a car there. If you
give me a hand a second, sergeant.

<P>FIRST WATCH Name and address.

<P>(<I>Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,
appears among the bystanders</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Quickly</I>.) O, the very man! (<I>He whispers</I>.) Simon
Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

<P>SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>To the watch, with drawling eye</I>.) That's all
right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (<I>He
laughs</I>.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Turns to the crowd</I>.) Here, what are you all gaping
at? Move on out of that.

<P>(<I>The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane</I>.)

<P>CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (<I>He
laughs, shaking his head</I>.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse.
What? Eh, what?

<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Laughs</I>.) I suppose so.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Nudges the second watch</I>.) Come and wipe your
name off the slate. (<I>He lilts, wagging his head</I>.) With my tooraloom
tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Genially</I>.) Ah, sure we were too.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Winking</I>.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round
there.

<P>SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn</I>.) Thank you
very much gentlemen, thank you. (<I>He mumbles confidentially</I>.) We
don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly
respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

<P>FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

<P>SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

<P>FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to
report it at the station.

<P>BLOOM (<I>Nods rapidly</I>.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden
duty.

<P>SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

<P>THE WATCH (<I>Saluting together</I>.) Night, gentlemen. (<I>They move
off with slow heavy tread</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Blows</I>.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a
car?.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder
to the car brought up against the scaffolding</I>.) Two commercials that
were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two
quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly
girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

<P>BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Laughs</I>.) Sure they wanted me to join in with
the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.
(<I>He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye</I>.) Thanks be to God
we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

<P>BLOOM (<I>Tries to laugh</I>.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was
just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor
fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and
I was just making my way home...

<P>(<I>The horse neighs</I>.)

<P>THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

<P>CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after
we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and
got off to see. (<I>He laughs</I>.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will
I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

<P>BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

<P>(<I>Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls
at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down</I>.)

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Scratches his nape</I>.) Sandycove! (<I>He bends
down and calls to Stephen</I>.) Eh! (<I>He calls again</I>.) Eh! He's covered
with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

<P>BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

<P>CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll
shove along. (<I>He laughs</I>.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying
the dead. Safe home!

<P>THE HORSE (<I>Neighs</I>.) Hohohohohome.

<P>BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

<P>(<I>Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse
harness jingles</I>.)

<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>From the car, standing</I>.) Night.

<P>BLOOM Night.

<P>(<I>The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The
car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat
sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey
joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom
shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher
reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what
else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that
is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner
of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.
Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.
The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo
lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and
ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the
shoulder</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Eh! Ho! (<I>There is no answer he bends again</I>.) Mr Dedalus!
(<I>There is no answer</I>.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (<I>He
bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
form</I>.) Stephen! (<I>There is no answer. He calls again</I>.) Stephen!

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Groans</I>.) Who? Black panther vampire. (<I>He sighs and
stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) </I>Who...
drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

<P>(<I>He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (<I>He bends again and undoes the
buttons of Stephen's waistcoat</I>.) To breathe. (<I>He brushes the wood
shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers</I>.) One
pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (<I>He listens</I>.) What!

<P>(<I>Murmurs</I>.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>... shadows... the woods
<BR>... white breast... dim...</BLOCKQUOTE>
(<I>He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding
his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens
and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and
form</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Communes with the night</I>.) Face reminds me of his poor
mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught.
A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (<I>He murmurs</I>.)...
swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or
parts, art or arts... (<I>He murmurs</I>.) in the rough sands of the sea.
a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

<P>(<I>Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his
lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears
slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton
suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his
hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page</I>.)

<P>BLOOM (<I>Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly</I>.) Rudy!

<P>RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing,
smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby
buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet
howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)
