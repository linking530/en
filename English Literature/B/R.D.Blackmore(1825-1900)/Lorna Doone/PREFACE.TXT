Preface





This work is called a 'romance,' because the incidents,

characters, time, and scenery, are alike romantic.  And

in shaping this old tale, the Writer neither dares, nor

desires, to claim for it the dignity or cumber it with

the difficulty of an historic novel.



And yet he thinks that the outlines are filled in more

carefully, and the situations (however simple) more

warmly coloured and quickened, than a reader would

expect to find in what is called a 'legend.'



And he knows that any son of Exmoor, chancing on this

volume, cannot fail to bring to mind the nurse-tales of

his childhood--the savage deeds of the outlaw Doones in

the depth of Bagworthy Forest, the beauty of the

hapless maid brought up in the midst of them, the plain

John Ridd's Herculean power, and (memory's too

congenial food) the exploits of Tom Faggus.



March, 1869.
