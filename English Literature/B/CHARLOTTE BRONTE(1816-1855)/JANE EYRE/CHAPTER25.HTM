<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours
were being

<P>numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced- the bridal

<P>day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. I, at

<P>least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked,

<P>corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber;

<P>to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London:

<P>and so should I (D.V.),- or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a

<P>person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained

<P>to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr.

<P>Rochester had himself written the direction, 'Mrs. Rochester,-

<P>Hotel, London,' on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them,
or

<P>to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: she would not

<P>be born till to-morrow, some time after eight o'clock A.M.; and I

<P>would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I

<P>assigned to her all that property. It was enough that in yonder

<P>closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had

<P>already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for

<P>not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured

<P>robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut

<P>the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained;

<P>which, at this evening hour- nine o'clock- gave out certainly a most

<P>ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. 'I will leave

<P>you by yourself, white dream,' I said. 'I am feverish: I hear the wind

<P>blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish;
not

<P>only the anticipation of the great change- the new life which was to

<P>commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share,

<P>doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me

<P>forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third

<P>cause influenced my mind more than they.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something
had

<P>happened which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen

<P>the event but myself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr.

<P>Rochester that night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned:

<P>business had called him to a small estate of two or three farms he

<P>possessed thirty miles off- business it was requisite he should settle

<P>in person, previous to his meditated departure from England. I

<P>waited now his return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him

<P>the solution of the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes,

<P>reader: and, when I disclose my secret to him, you shall share the

<P>confidence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind,
which

<P>all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however,

<P>bringing a speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it

<P>seemed to augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew

<P>steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back

<P>their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending

<P>their branchy heads northward- the clouds drifted from pole to pole,

<P>fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been

<P>visible that July day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before
the wind,

<P>delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent

<P>thundering through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the

<P>wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk,

<P>split down the centre, gaped ghastly. The cloven halves were not

<P>broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them

<P>unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed- the

<P>sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and

<P>next winter's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth:

<P>as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree- a ruin, but an

<P>entire ruin.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did right to hold fast to each other,' I said: as
if the

<P>monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. 'I think,

<P>scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a

<P>little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the

<P>faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more- never

<P>more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time

<P>of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate:

<P>each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.' As I

<P>looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the

<P>sky which filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half

<P>overcast; she seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and

<P>buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind

<P>fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and

<P>water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and

<P>I ran off again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered
up the

<P>apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn;

<P>then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried

<P>them into the house and put them away in the storeroom. Then I

<P>repaired to the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for,

<P>though summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would

<P>like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had

<P>been kindled some time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by

<P>the chimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the

<P>curtain, and had the candles brought in ready for lighting. More

<P>restless than ever, when I had completed these arrangements I could

<P>not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little timepiece in the

<P>room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How late it grows!' I said. 'I will run down to the gates:
it is

<P>moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be

<P>coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered
the

<P>gates; but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the

<P>left, was all still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds

<P>crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out, it was a long pale

<P>line, unvaried by one moving speck.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked- a tear of

<P>disappointment and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I

<P>lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew

<P>close her curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came

<P>driving fast on the gale.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish he would come! I wish he would come!' I exclaimed,
seized

<P>with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before

<P>tea; now it was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened?

<P>The event of last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a

<P>warning of disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised;

<P>and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune

<P>had passed its meridian, and must now decline.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I cannot return to the house,' I thought; 'I cannot
sit by

<P>the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire

<P>my limbs than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured
a quarter

<P>of a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full

<P>gallop; a dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he:

<P>here he was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the

<P>moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright:

<P>he took his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet

<P>him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There!' he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and
bent from

<P>the saddle: 'you can't do without me, that is evident. Step on my

<P>boot-toe; give me both hands: mount!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A
hearty

<P>kissing I got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I

<P>swallowed as well as I could. He checked himself in his exultation

<P>to demand, 'But is there anything the matter, Janet, that you come

<P>to meet me at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear
to wait

<P>in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid;

<P>pull my cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your

<P>cheek and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the

<P>matter?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you have been both?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by and by, sir;
and I

<P>daresay you will only laugh at me for my pains.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till
then I

<P>dare not: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as

<P>slippery as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I

<P>could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to

<P>have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold

<P>to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wanted you: but don't boast. Here we are at Thornfield:
now

<P>let me get down.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and
he

<P>followed me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put

<P>something dry on, and then return to him in the library; and he

<P>stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a promise that I

<P>would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I

<P>found him at supper.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it
is the

<P>last meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before
you, Jane?

<P>Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I
hardly know

<P>what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Except me: I am substantial enough- touch me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a
mere dream.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand, laughing. 'Is that a dream?' said
he, placing

<P>it close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand,
as

<P>well as a long, strong arm.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,' said I, as I put
it down

<P>from before my face. 'Sir, have you finished supper?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were
again

<P>alone, I stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's

<P>knee.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is near midnight,' I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me
the night

<P>before my wedding.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two
at least:

<P>I have no wish to go to bed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are all your arrangements complete?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And on my part likewise,' he returned, 'I have settled
everything;

<P>and we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half an hour after our

<P>return from church.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word-
"very

<P>well," Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek!

<P>and how strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe I am.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.
I wish this

<P>present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next day

<P>may come charged?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited,
or

<P>over-fatigued.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Calm?- no: but happy- to the heart's core.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face:
it was

<P>ardent and flushed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give me your confidence, Jane,' he said: 'relieve your
mind of any

<P>weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?-

<P>that I shall not prove a good husband?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to
enter?- of

<P>the new life into which you are passing?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity

<P>perplex and pain me. I want an explanation.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something

<P>which had happened in my absence:- nothing, probably, of

<P>consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs.

<P>Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you have overheard the

<P>servants talk?- your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.' It struck twelve- I waited till the timepiece
had

<P>concluded its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating

<P>stroke, and then I proceeded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my

<P>ceaseless bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by

<P>any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a

<P>glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love

<P>you. No, sir, don't caress me now- let me talk undisturbed.

<P>Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events

<P>were working together for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if

<P>you recollect- the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions

<P>respecting your safety or comfort on your journey. I walked a little

<P>while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you

<P>in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence. I

<P>thought of the life that lay before me- your life, sir- an existence

<P>more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths

<P>of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own

<P>strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary

<P>wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air

<P>turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs

<P>to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under
it

<P>in the box I found your present- the veil which, in your princely

<P>extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I

<P>would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.

<P>I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about

<P>your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian

<P>bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down

<P>to you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a

<P>covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for

<P>a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor

<P>connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your

<P>impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any

<P>necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your

<P>standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How well you read me, you witch!' interposed Mr. Rochester:
'but

<P>what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find

<P>poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the
fabric, I

<P>found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare

<P>me, because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it

<P>grew dark, the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows

<P>now- wild and high- but "with a sullen, moaning sound" far more eerie.

<P>I wished you were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the

<P>empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went

<P>to bed, I could not sleep- a sense of anxious excitement distressed

<P>me. The gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful

<P>under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell,

<P>but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made

<P>out it must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it

<P>ceased. On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and

<P>gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced

<P>a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During

<P>all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road;

<P>total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with

<P>the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and

<P>feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed

<P>piteously in my ear. I thought, sir, that you were on the road a

<P>long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and

<P>made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop-

<P>but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away

<P>inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every

<P>moment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when
I am

<P>close to you? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and

<P>think only of real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes- I

<P>will not forget that; and you cannot deny it. Those words did not

<P>die inarticulate on your lips. I heard them clear and soft: a

<P>thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music- "I think it is a

<P>glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because

<P>I love you." Do you love me, Jane?- repeat it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do, sir- I do, with my whole heart.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' he said, after some minutes' silence, 'it is strange;
but

<P>that sentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because

<P>you said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your

<P>upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and

<P>devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near me. Look

<P>wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your wild,

<P>shy, provoking smiles, tell me you hate me- tease me, vex me; do

<P>anything but move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content,
when I

<P>have finished my tale: but hear me to the end.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had
found the

<P>source of your melancholy in a dream.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head. 'What! is there more? But I will not believe
it to

<P>be anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience
of

<P>his manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was
a dreary

<P>ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the

<P>stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and

<P>very fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the

<P>grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth,

<P>and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl,

<P>I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down

<P>anywhere, however tired were my arms- however much its weight

<P>impeded my progress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse

<P>at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were

<P>departing for many years and for a distant country. I climbed the thin

<P>wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you

<P>from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches
I

<P>grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and

<P>almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a

<P>speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so

<P>strong I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the

<P>scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent

<P>forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the

<P>child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Jane, that is all.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking,
a

<P>gleam dazzled my eyes; I thought- Oh, it is daylight! But I was

<P>mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in.

<P>There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet,

<P>where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil,

<P>stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, "Sophie, what are you

<P>doing?" No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took

<P>the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the

<P>portmanteau. "Sophie! Sophie!" I again cried: and still it was silent.

<P>I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then

<P>bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my

<P>veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not

<P>Mrs. Fairfax: it was not- no, I was sure of it, and am still- it was

<P>not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It must have been one of them,' interrupted my master.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape
standing

<P>before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield

<P>Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Describe it, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and
dark

<P>hair hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on:

<P>it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I

<P>cannot tell.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you see her face?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its
place; she

<P>held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head,

<P>and turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the

<P>visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how were they?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fearful and ghastly to me- oh, sir, I never saw a face
like it! It

<P>was a discoloured face- it was a savage face. I wish I could forget

<P>the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the

<P>lineaments!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark;
the brow

<P>furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.

<P>Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You may.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of the foul German spectre- the Vampyre.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah!- what did it do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in
two parts,

<P>and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Afterwards?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps
it saw

<P>dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.

<P>Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me-

<P>she thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under

<P>my eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost

<P>consciousness: for the second time in my life- only the second time-
I

<P>became insensible from terror.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who was with you when you revived?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head
and face in

<P>water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,

<P>and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now

<P>sir, tell me who and what that woman was?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.
I

<P>must be careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made

<P>for rough handling.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing
was

<P>real: the transaction actually took place.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield
Hall a

<P>ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you

<P>without a tear- without a kiss- without a word?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not yet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced
which is to

<P>bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no

<P>recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be
only

<P>such: I wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to

<P>me the mystery of that awful visitant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning,
and

<P>when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the

<P>cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there- on

<P>the carpet- I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,- the

<P>veil, torn from top to bottom in two halves!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung
his arms

<P>round me. 'Thank God!' he exclaimed, 'that if anything malignant did

<P>come near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh,
to

<P>think what might have happened!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him,
I

<P>could scarcely pant. After some minutes' silence, he continued,

<P>cheerily-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it. It was half
dream,

<P>half reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that

<P>woman was- must have been- Grace Poole. You call her a strange being

<P>yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her- what

<P>did she do to me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and

<P>waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost

<P>delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance

<P>different from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black

<P>face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results

<P>of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is

<P>like her. I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house:

<P>when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not

<P>now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the

<P>mystery?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible

<P>one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear

<P>so- relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented

<P>smile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?' he asked,
as I

<P>lit my candle.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.
You must

<P>share it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident

<P>you have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did

<P>not sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall be very glad to do so, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie
when you

<P>go upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good

<P>time to-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast

<P>before eight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care

<P>away, Janet. Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?

<P>and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look

<P>here' (he lifted up the curtain)- 'it is a lovely night!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds,
now

<P>trooping before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing

<P>off eastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my
eyes, 'how

<P>is my Janet now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The night is serene, sir; and so am I.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night;
but of

<P>happy love and blissful union.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed
dream of

<P>sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.

<P>With little Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood- so

<P>tranquil, so passionless, so innocent- and waited for the coming

<P>day: all my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the

<P>sun rose I rose too. I remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I

<P>remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and

<P>I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I

<P>feared my sobs would break her still sound repose. She seemed the

<P>emblem of my past life; and he I was now to array myself to meet,

<P>the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future day.
