<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I HAD forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did,
and also

<P>to let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the

<P>moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in

<P>her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked

<P>in at me through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.

<P>Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk-

<P>silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I

<P>half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good God! What a cry!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night- its silence- its rest, was rent in twain by
a savage,

<P>a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm
was

<P>paralysed. The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being

<P>uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the

<P>widest-winged condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out

<P>such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering

<P>such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.
And

<P>overhead- yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling- I now

<P>heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a

<P>half-smothered voice shouted-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Help! help! help!' three times rapidly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will no one come?' it cried; and then, while the staggering
and

<P>stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rochester! Rochester! for God's sake, come!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the

<P>gallery. Another step stamped on the flooring above and something

<P>fell; and there was silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs;
I

<P>issued from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,

<P>terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one

<P>looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and

<P>ladies alike had quitted their beds; and 'Oh! what is it?'- 'Who is

<P>hurt?'- 'What has happened?'- 'Fetch a light!'- 'Is it fire?'- 'Are

<P>there robbers?'- 'Where shall we run?' was demanded confusedly on

<P>all hands. But for the moon-light they would have been in complete

<P>darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed,

<P>some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where the devil is Rochester?' cried Colonel Dent. 'I
cannot

<P>find him in his bed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here! here!' was shouted in return. 'Be composed, all
of you:

<P>I'm coming.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr.
Rochester

<P>advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.

<P>One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss

<P>Ingram.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What awful event has taken place?' said she. 'Speak! let
us know

<P>the worst at once!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But don't pull me down or strangle me,' he replied: for
the Misses

<P>Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast

<P>white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All's right!- all's right!' he cried. 'It's a mere rehearsal
of

<P>Much Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.
Calming

<P>himself by an effort, he added-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She's an

<P>excitable, nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition,

<P>or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with

<P>fright. Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for,

<P>till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have

<P>the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you

<P>will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa,

<P>return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames' (to

<P>the dowagers), 'you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay
in

<P>this chill gallery any longer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he
contrived

<P>to get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I

<P>did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as

<P>unnoticed I had left it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and
dressed

<P>myself carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the

<P>words that had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for

<P>they had proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me

<P>that it was not a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through

<P>the house; and that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely

<P>an invention framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready

<P>for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking

<P>out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew

<P>not what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,

<P>struggle, and call.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased

<P>gradually, and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed
as

<P>a desert. It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.

<P>Meantime the moon declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit
in

<P>the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed

<P>as I was. I left the window, and moved with little noise across the

<P>carpet; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped

<P>low at the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I wanted?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you up?' asked the voice I expected to hear, viz.,
my

<P>master's.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And dressed?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come out, then, quietly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a
light.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want you,' he said: 'come this way: take your time,
and make

<P>no noise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as
softly as a

<P>cat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the

<P>dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and

<P>stood at his side.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you a sponge in your room?' he asked in a whisper.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you any salts- volatile salts?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go back and fetch both.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts
in my

<P>drawer, and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a

<P>key in his hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put

<P>it in the lock; he paused, and addressed me again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness,
and no

<P>faintness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just give me your hand,' he said: 'it will not do to risk
a

<P>fainting fit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my fingers into his. 'Warm and steady,' was his remark:
he

<P>turned the key and opened the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day
Mrs. Fairfax

<P>showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the

<P>tapestry was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent,

<P>which had then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out

<P>of the room within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost

<P>like a dog quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said

<P>to me, 'Wait a minute,' and he went forward to the inner apartment.

<P>A shout of laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and

<P>terminating in Grace Poole's own goblin ha! ha! She then was there.
He

<P>made some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low

<P>voice address him: he came out and closed the door behind him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here, Jane!' he said; and I walked round to the other
side of a

<P>large bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable

<P>portion of the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat

<P>in it, dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his

<P>head leant back; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle

<P>over him; I recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face- the

<P>stranger, Mason: I saw too that his linen on one side and one arm, was

<P>almost soaked in blood.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hold the candle,' said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he
fetched

<P>a basin of water from the washstand: 'Hold that,' said he. I obeyed.

<P>He took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like

<P>face; he asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.

<P>Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester

<P>opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were

<P>bandaged: he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there immediate danger?' murmured Mr. Mason.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pooh! No- a mere scratch. Don't be so overcome, man: bear
up! I'll

<P>fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by

<P>morning, I hope. Jane,' he continued.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman,
for an

<P>hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when

<P>it returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that

<P>stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to

<P>him on any pretext- and- Richard, it will be at the peril of your life

<P>if you speak to her: open your lips- agitate yourself- and I'll not

<P>answer for the consequences.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not
move;

<P>fear, either of death or of something else, appeared almost to

<P>paralyse him. Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand,

<P>and I proceeded to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then

<P>saying, 'Remember!- No conversation,' he left the room. I

<P>experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the

<P>sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one
of its

<P>mystic cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my

<P>eyes and hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door:

<P>yes- that was appalling- the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the

<P>thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly

<P>countenance- these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose- these eyes

<P>now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on

<P>me, and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand

<P>again and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the

<P>trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on

<P>my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry

<P>round me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and

<P>quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite- whose

<P>front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads

<P>of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a

<P>frame; while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying

<P>Christ.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam
hovered

<P>here or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that

<P>bent his brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the

<P>devilish face of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed

<P>gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor- of

<P>Satan himself- in his subordinate's form.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen
for

<P>the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But

<P>since Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I

<P>heard but three sounds at three long intervals,- a step creak, a

<P>momentary renewal of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human

<P>groan.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that
lived

<P>incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled

<P>nor subdued by the owner?- what mystery, that broke out now in fire

<P>and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it,

<P>that, masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice,

<P>now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And this man I bent over- this commonplace, quiet stranger-
how had

<P>he become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown
at

<P>him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely

<P>season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr.

<P>Rochester assign him an apartment below- what brought him here? And

<P>why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why

<P>did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?

<P>Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been

<P>outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted

<P>against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in

<P>oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester;

<P>that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the

<P>inertness of the former: the few words which had passed between them

<P>assured me of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse,

<P>the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by

<P>the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester's

<P>dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival? Why had the mere name

<P>of this unresisting individual- whom his word now sufficed to

<P>control like a child- fallen on him, a few hours since, as a

<P>thunderbolt might fall on an oak?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he
whispered:

<P>'Jane, I have got a blow- I have got a blow, Jane.' I could not forget

<P>how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was
no

<P>light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the

<P>vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When will he come? When will he come?' I cried inwardly,
as the

<P>night lingered and lingered- as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned,

<P>sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again,

<P>held the water to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him

<P>the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily
or

<P>mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast

<P>prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild,

<P>and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I
perceived

<P>streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then

<P>approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his

<P>distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted:

<P>in five minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me

<P>my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours:

<P>many a week has seemed shorter.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had
been to

<P>fetch.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Carter, be on the alert,' he said to this last: 'I
give you

<P>but half an hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages,

<P>getting the patient downstairs and all.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But is he fit to move, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous,
his

<P>spirits must be kept up. Come, set to work.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the
holland

<P>blind, let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and

<P>cheered to see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were

<P>beginning to brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the

<P>surgeon was already handling.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, my good fellow, how are you?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She's done for me, I fear,' was the faint reply.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a whit!- courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly
be a pin

<P>the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all. Carter,

<P>assure him there's no danger.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can do that conscientiously,' said Carter, who had now
undone

<P>the bandages; 'only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would

<P>not have bled so much- but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is

<P>torn as well as cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there

<P>have been teeth here!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She bit me,' he murmured. 'She worried me like a tigress,
when

<P>Rochester got the knife from her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should not have yielded: you should have grappled
with her

<P>at once,' said Mr. Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But under such circumstances, what could one do?' returned

<P>Mason. 'Oh, it was frightful!' he added, shuddering. 'And I did not

<P>expect it: she looked so quiet at first.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I warned you,' was his friend's answer; 'I said- be on
your

<P>guard when you go near her. Besides, you might have waited till

<P>to-morrow, and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the

<P>interview to-night, and alone.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought I could have done some good.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to
hear

<P>you: but, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer

<P>enough for not taking my advice; so I'll say no more. Carter-

<P>hurry!- hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look
to

<P>this other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart,'
said Mason.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression
of

<P>disgust, horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to

<P>distortion, but he only said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish:
don't

<P>repeat it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish I could forget it,' was the answer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will when you are out of the country: when you get
back to

<P>Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried- or rather,

<P>you need not think of her at all.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Impossible to forget this night!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought
you

<P>were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and

<P>talking now. There!- Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll

<P>make you decent in a trice. Jane' (he turned to me for the first

<P>time since his re-entrance), 'take this key: go down into my

<P>bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top

<P>drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and

<P>neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the

<P>articles named, and returned with them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' said he, 'go to the other side of the bed while
I order

<P>his toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I retired as directed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?'
inquired Mr.

<P>Rochester presently.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; all was very still.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better,
both

<P>for your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have

<P>striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at

<P>last. Here, Carter, help him on with his waistcoat. Where did you

<P>leave your furred cloak? You can't travel a mile without that, I know,

<P>in this damned cold climate. In your room?- Jane, run down to Mr.

<P>Mason's room,- the one next mine,- and fetch a cloak you will see

<P>there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle
lined

<P>and edged with fur.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, I've another errand for you,' said my untiring master;
you

<P>must away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet,

<P>Jane!- a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You

<P>must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little

<P>phial and a little glass you will find there,- quick!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That's well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of

<P>administering a dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this

<P>cordial at Rome, of an Italian charlatan- a fellow you would have

<P>kicked, Carter. It is not a thing to be used indiscriminately, but

<P>it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance. Jane, a little water.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out the tiny glass, and I half-filled it from the

<P>water-bottle on the washstand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That will do;- now wet the lip of the phial.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid,
and

<P>presented it to Mason.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for
an hour

<P>or so.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But will it hurt me?- is it inflammatory?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Drink! drink! drink!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.
He

<P>was dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and

<P>sullied. Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had

<P>swallowed the liquid; he then took his arm-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now I am sure you can get on your feet,' he said- 'try.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient rose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good
cheer,

<P>Richard; step out- that's it!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do feel better,' remarked Mr. Mason.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to
the

<P>backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the

<P>post-chaise you will see in the yard- or just outside, for I told

<P>him not to drive his rattling wheels over the pavement- to be ready;

<P>we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the

<P>stairs and hem.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on
the point of

<P>rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The

<P>side-passage door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as

<P>possible: all the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and

<P>there was a post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver

<P>seated on the box, stationed outside. I approached him, and said the

<P>gentlemen were coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and

<P>listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the

<P>curtains were yet drawn over the servants' chamber windows; little

<P>birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees,

<P>whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one

<P>side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in

<P>their closed stables: all else was still.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester
and

<P>the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him

<P>into the chaise; Carter followed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take care of him,' said Mr. Rochester to the latter, 'and
keep him

<P>at your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two

<P>to see how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no
wind-

<P>good-bye, Dick.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fairfax-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, what is it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly
as may

<P>be: let her- ' he stopped and burst into tears.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,' was the
answer:

<P>he shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet would to God there was an end of all this!' added
Mr.

<P>Rochester, as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards
a

<P>door in the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done

<P>with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard

<P>him call 'Jane!' He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for

<P>me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,'
he said;

<P>'that house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,' he answered;

<P>'and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that

<P>the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble

<P>is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly

<P>bark. Now here' (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered)

<P>'all is real, sweet, and pure.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees,
pear

<P>trees, and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full
of

<P>all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses,

<P>pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various

<P>fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers

<P>and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them:

<P>the sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined

<P>the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks

<P>under them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, will you have a flower?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and
offered

<P>it to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high
and light

<P>clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm- this

<P>placid and balmy atmosphere?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do, very much.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have passed a strange night, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And it has made you look pale- were you afraid when I
left you

<P>alone with Mason?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I had fastened the door- I had the key in my pocket:
I

<P>should have been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb- my pet

<P>lamb- so near a wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her- put the thing
out of

<P>your thoughts.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she
stays.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never fear- I will take care of myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now,
sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England:
nor even

<P>then. To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may

<P>crack and spue fire any day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence,
sir, is

<P>evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or

<P>wilfully injure you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he
hurt me-

<P>but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word,

<P>deprive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear,
and show

<P>him how to avert the danger.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily
threw

<P>it from him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger
be?

<P>Annihilated in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only

<P>had to say to him "Do that," and the thing has been done. But I cannot

<P>give him orders in this case: I cannot say "Beware of harming me,

<P>Richard"; for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that

<P>harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you

<P>further. You are my little friend, are you not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that
is right.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in
your gait

<P>and mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing

<P>me- working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say,

<P>"all that is right": for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there

<P>would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively

<P>glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me, quiet

<P>and pale, and would say, "No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it,

<P>because it is wrong"; and would become immutable as a fixed star.

<P>Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not

<P>show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you

<P>are, you should transfix me at once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have
from

<P>me, sir, you are very safe.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit
down.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it
contained

<P>a rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me:

<P>but I stood before him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit,' he said; 'the bench is long enough for two. You
don't

<P>hesitate to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt,
have been

<P>unwise.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew- while
all the

<P>flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their

<P>young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do

<P>their first spell of work- I'll put a case to you, which you must

<P>endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me

<P>you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or

<P>that you err in staying.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; I am content.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:- suppose you
were no

<P>longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged

<P>from childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land;

<P>conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what

<P>nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow

<P>you through life and taint all your existence. Mind, I don't say a

<P>crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act,

<P>which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is

<P>error. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly

<P>insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures,

<P>but neither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope

<P>has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens

<P>in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of

<P>setting. Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of

<P>your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile:

<P>happiness in pleasure- I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure- such

<P>as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered,

<P>you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new

<P>acquaintance- how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much

<P>of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty

<P>years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh,

<P>healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives,

<P>regenerates: you feel better days come back-higher wishes, purer

<P>feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what

<P>remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To

<P>attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of

<P>custom-a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience

<P>sanctifies nor your judgment approves?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for
some good

<P>spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain

<P>aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle

<P>Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the

<P>tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and
repentant,

<P>man justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him

<P>for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing

<P>his own peace of mind and regeneration of life?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir,' I answered, 'a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation

<P>should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die;

<P>philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any

<P>one you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his

<P>equals for strength to amend and solace to heal.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But the instrument- the instrument! God, who does the
work,

<P>ordains the instrument. I have myself- I tell it you without

<P>parable- been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I

<P>have found the instrument for my cure in-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly

<P>rustling. I almost wondered they did not check their songs and

<P>whispers to catch the suspended revelation; but they would have had
to

<P>wait many minutes- so long was the silence protracted. At last I

<P>looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Little friend,' said he, in quite a changed tone- while
his face

<P>changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh

<P>and sarcastic- 'you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram:

<P>don't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a

<P>vengeance?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the
walk, and

<P>when he came back he was humming a tune.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, Jane,' said he, stopping before me, 'you are quite
pale with

<P>your vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Curse you? No, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers!
They

<P>were warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the

<P>mysterious chamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whenever I can be useful, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure
I shall not

<P>be able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me

<P>company? To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her

<P>and know her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A strapper- a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom;
with

<P>hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me!

<P>there's Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery,

<P>through that wicket.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in
the yard,

<P>saying cheerfully-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone
before

<P>sunrise: I rose at four to see him off.'
