CHAPTER II</FONT></B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I RESISTED all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance

<P>which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot

<P>were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside

<P>myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was

<P>conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to

<P>strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved,

<P>in my desperation, to go all lengths.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For shame! for shame!' cried the lady's-maid. 'What shocking

<P>conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's

<P>son! Your young master.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for
your keep.

<P>There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated
by Mrs.

<P>Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it

<P>like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,' said Bessie.
'Miss

<P>Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary

<P>ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it

<P>inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't take them off,' I cried; 'I will not stir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my
hands.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mind you don't,' said Bessie; and when she had ascertained
that

<P>I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss

<P>Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my

<P>face, as incredulous of my sanity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She never did so before,' at last said Bessie, turning
to the

<P>Abigail.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But it was always in her,' was the reply. 'I've told Missis

<P>often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She's

<P>an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so

<P>much cover.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations
to

<P>Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would

<P>have to go to the poorhouse.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new
to me: my

<P>very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.

<P>This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear:

<P>very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot

<P>joined in-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with
the Misses

<P>Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought

<P>up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will

<P>have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make

<P>yourself agreeable to them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What we tell you is for your good,' added Bessie, in no
harsh

<P>voice; 'you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you

<P>would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude,

<P>Missis will send you away, I am sure.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Besides,' said Miss Abbot, 'God will punish her: He might
strike

<P>her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?

<P>Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for

<P>anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for

<P>if you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the

<P>chimney and fetch you away.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in,
I might

<P>say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at

<P>Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the

<P>accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and

<P>stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars

<P>of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a

<P>tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds

<P>always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar

<P>drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was

<P>covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with
a

<P>blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were

<P>of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding

<P>shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and

<P>pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.

<P>Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the

<P>head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and

<P>looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was
silent,

<P>because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was

<P>known to be so seldom entered. The housemaid alone came here on

<P>Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet

<P>dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review

<P>the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were

<P>stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her

<P>deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the

<P>red-room- the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber
he

<P>breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne
by

<P>the undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary

<P>consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had
left me

<P>riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose

<P>before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with

<P>subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my

<P>left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them

<P>repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite

<P>sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got
up

<P>and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning,
I

<P>had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance

<P>involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and

<P>darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange

<P>little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms

<P>specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all

<P>else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one

<P>of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories

<P>represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing

<P>before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not
yet her

<P>hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the

<P>revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to

<P>stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the

<P>dismal present.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud

<P>indifference, all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality,

<P>turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.

<P>Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for

<P>ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try
to

<P>win any one's favour? Eliza, who, was headstrong and selfish, was

<P>respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite,

<P>a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her

<P>beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to

<P>all who, looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault.

<P>John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the

<P>necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at

<P>the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the

<P>buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother

<P>'old girl,' too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to

<P>his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and

<P>spoiled her silk attire; and he was still 'her own darling.' I dared

<P>commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed

<P>naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and

<P>from noon to night.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had
received:

<P>no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had

<P>turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was

<P>loaded with general opprobrium.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Unjust!- unjust!' said my reason, forced by the agonising
stimulus

<P>into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally

<P>wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from

<P>insupportable oppression- as running away, or, if that could not be

<P>effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!
How

<P>all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in

<P>what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I

<P>could not answer the ceaseless inward question- why I thus suffered;

<P>now, at the distance of- I will not say how many years, I see it

<P>clearly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there;
I had

<P>nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen

<P>vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love

<P>them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that

<P>could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing,

<P>opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a

<P>useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their

<P>pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at

<P>their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been

<P>a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child-

<P>though equally dependent and friendless- Mrs. Reed would have

<P>endured my presence more complacently; her children would have

<P>entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the

<P>servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the

<P>nursery.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four
o'clock,

<P>and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the

<P>rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the

<P>wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as
a

<P>stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,

<P>self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying

<P>ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought

<P>had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That

<P>certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under

<P>the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I

<P>had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to

<P>recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not

<P>remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle- my mother's

<P>brother- that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house;

<P>and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed

<P>that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs.

<P>Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,

<P>I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could

<P>she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with

<P>her, after her husband's death, by any tie? It must have been most

<P>irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the

<P>stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see
an

<P>uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not- never
doubted-

<P>that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and

<P>now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls-

<P>occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly

<P>gleaming mirror- I began to recall what I had heard of dead men,

<P>troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes,

<P>revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the

<P>oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit, harassed by the wrongs

<P>of his sister's child, might quit its abode- whether in the church

<P>vault or in the unknown world of the departed- and rise before me in

<P>this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any

<P>sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me,

<P>or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with

<P>strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be

<P>terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it-

<P>I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my

<P>head and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a

<P>light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon

<P>penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and

<P>this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and

<P>quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak

<P>of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by

<P>some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for

<P>horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift

<P>darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world.
My

<P>heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I

<P>deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was

<P>oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door

<P>and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the

<P>outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, are you ill?' said Bessie.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!' exclaimed
Abbot.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!' was my cry.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?' again
demanded

<P>Bessie.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.'
I had now

<P>got hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has screamed out on purpose,' declared Abbot, in some
disgust.

<P>'And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have

<P>excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her

<P>naughty tricks.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is all this?' demanded another voice peremptorily;
and Mrs.

<P>Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling

<P>stormily. 'Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre

<P>should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am,' pleaded Bessie.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her go,' was the only answer. 'Loose Bessie's hand,
child: you

<P>cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor

<P>artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that

<P>tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and

<P>it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I

<P>shall liberate you then.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O aunt! have pity! forgive me! I cannot endure it- let
me be

<P>punished some other way! I shall be killed if-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:' and so,
no doubt,

<P>she felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely.

<P>looked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and

<P>dangerous duplicity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient
of my now

<P>frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me

<P>in, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon

<P>after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit:

<P>unconsciousness closed the scene.
