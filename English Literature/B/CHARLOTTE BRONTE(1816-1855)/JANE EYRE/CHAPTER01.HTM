<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THERE was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We
had been

<P>wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;

<P>but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)

<P>the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a

<P>rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of

<P>the question.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially
on chilly

<P>afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,

<P>with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings

<P>of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my

<P>physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered
round

<P>their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the

<P>fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither

<P>quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had

<P>dispensed from joining the group; saying, 'She regretted to be under

<P>the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard

<P>from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was

<P>endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and

<P>childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner-

<P>something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were- she really

<P>must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,

<P>little children.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does Bessie say I have done?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides,
there is

<P>something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that

<P>manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly,

<P>remain silent.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A small breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped
in

<P>there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume,

<P>taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into

<P>the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a

<P>Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was

<P>shrined in double retirement.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand;
to

<P>the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating

<P>me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the

<P>leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.

<P>Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet

<P>lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly

<P>before a long and lamentable blast.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned to my book- Bewick's History of British Birds:
the

<P>letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet

<P>there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could

<P>not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts

<P>of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only

<P>inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its

<P>southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where
the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boils
round the naked, melancholy isles

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pours
in among the stormy Hebrides.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of

<P>Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with

<P>'the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of

<P>dreary space,- that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields

<P>of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine

<P>heights above heights, surround the pole and concentre the

<P>multiplied rigours of extreme cold.' Of these death-white realms I

<P>formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended

<P>notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely

<P>impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves

<P>with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock

<P>standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat

<P>stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing

<P>through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary
churchyard,

<P>with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low

<P>horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent,

<P>attesting the hour of eventide.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be
marine

<P>phantoms.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed
over

<P>quickly: it was an object of terror.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying
a

<P>distant crowd surrounding a gallows.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped

<P>understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:

<P>as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter

<P>evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having

<P>brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit

<P>about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped

<P>her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love

<P>and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as

<P>at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry,

<P>Earl of Moreland.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least
in my way.

<P>I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The

<P>breakfast-room door opened.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Boh! Madam Mope!' cried the voice of John Reed; then he
paused: he

<P>found the room apparently empty.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where the dickens is she!' he continued. 'Lizzy! Georgy!

<P>(calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out

<P>into the rain- bad animal!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is well I drew the curtain,' thought I; and I wished

<P>fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed

<P>have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or

<P>conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at

<P>once-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea
of being

<P>dragged forth by the said Jack.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you want?' I asked, with awkward diffidence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Say, "What do you want, Master Reed?"' was the answer.
'I want you

<P>to come here;' and seating himself in an armchair, he intimated by a

<P>gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years
older

<P>than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy

<P>and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy

<P>limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table,

<P>which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and

<P>flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had

<P>taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate

<P>health.' Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well
if

<P>he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's

<P>heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more

<P>refined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application and,

<P>perhaps, to pining after home.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; John had not much affection for his mother and sisters,
and an

<P>antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times
in

<P>the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve
I

<P>had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he

<P>came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he

<P>inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his

<P>menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend

<P>their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was

<P>blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him

<P>abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more

<P>frequently, however, behind her back.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he
spent

<P>some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he

<P>could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and

<P>while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance

<P>of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion
in

<P>my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and

<P>strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a

<P>step or two from his chair.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,'
said

<P>he, 'and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the

<P>look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of
replying to

<P>it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow

<P>the insult.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What were you doing behind the curtain?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was reading.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Show the book.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned to the window and fetched it thence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have no business to take our books; you are a dependant,

<P>mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought

<P>to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and

<P>eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense. Now,

<P>I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the

<P>house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the

<P>door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but
when I saw

<P>him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I

<P>instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough,

<P>however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head

<P>against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp:

<P>my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wicked and cruel boy!' I said. 'You are like a murderer-
you are

<P>like a slave-driver- you are like the Roman emperors!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed
my opinion

<P>of Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which
I

<P>never thought thus to have declared aloud.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! what!' he cried. 'Did she say that to me? Did you
hear

<P>her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my
shoulder: he

<P>had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a

<P>murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my

<P>neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations

<P>for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic

<P>sort. I don't very well know what I did with my hands, but he called

<P>me 'Rat! Rat!' and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and

<P>Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came

<P>upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:

<P>I heard the words-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Mrs. Reed subjoined-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.'
Four

<P>hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
