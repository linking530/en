<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported

<P>conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to

<P>suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,-

<P>I desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and

<P>weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new

<P>allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed

<P>surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since

<P>my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever

<P>between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep

<P>in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my

<P>time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the

<P>drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to

<P>school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not

<P>long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now

<P>more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted

<P>aversion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders,
spoke to

<P>me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever

<P>he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly

<P>turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and

<P>desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought
it

<P>better to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I

<P>had burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature
as

<P>hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either

<P>that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to

<P>follow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama.
I

<P>heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how 'that nasty

<P>Jane Eyre' had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather

<P>harshly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go
near her;

<P>she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your

<P>sisters should associate with her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly,
and

<P>without at all deliberating on my words-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are not fit to associate with me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this
strange

<P>and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me

<P>like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge
of

<P>my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or

<P>utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?' was
my

<P>scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed

<P>as if my tongue pronounced words, without my will consenting to

<P>their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no

<P>control.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?' said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold

<P>composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took

<P>her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know

<P>whether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and
think;

<P>and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long,

<P>and how you wish me dead.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly,

<P>she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie

<P>supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she

<P>proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child

<P>ever reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed

<P>only bad feelings surging in my breast.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas

<P>and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual

<P>festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening

<P>parties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my

<P>share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of

<P>Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room,

<P>dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair

<P>elaborately ringleted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of

<P>the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the

<P>butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments

<P>were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room

<P>door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would

<P>retire from the stair-head to the solitary and silent nursery:

<P>there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had

<P>not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very

<P>rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I

<P>should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with

<P>her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed,
in

<P>a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had

<P>dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively

<P>regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing the

<P>candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the

<P>fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing

<P>worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank

<P>to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as

<P>I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.
To

<P>this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,

<P>and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to

<P>find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image,

<P>shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with

<P>what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it

<P>alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded

<P>in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was

<P>comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of
the

<P>company, and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs:

<P>sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her

<P>scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper- a bun

<P>or a cheese-cake- then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and

<P>when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice

<P>she kissed me, and said, 'Good night, Miss Jane.' When thus gentle,

<P>Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world;

<P>and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and

<P>amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably,

<P>as she was too often wont to do. Bessie, Lee must, I think, have

<P>been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she

<P>did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge

<P>from the impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty

<P>too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct. I

<P>remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very

<P>nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious

<P>and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice:

<P>still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead

<P>Hall.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in
the morning:

<P>Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been

<P>summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm

<P>garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was

<P>fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and

<P>hoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic,

<P>and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of

<P>eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener

<P>about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary

<P>having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products

<P>of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair

<P>off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to

<P>her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or

<P>an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered

<P>by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued

<P>treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate
of

<P>interest- fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every

<P>quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the
glass,

<P>and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers,

<P>of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was

<P>making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it

<P>arranged before she returned, (for Bessie now frequently employed me

<P>as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs,

<P>etc.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to

<P>the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house

<P>furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her

<P>playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates

<P>and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for

<P>lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers

<P>with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the

<P>glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was

<P>still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the

<P>carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white

<P>foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates

<P>thrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the

<P>drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none

<P>ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front
of

<P>the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.

<P>All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found

<P>livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which

<P>came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed

<P>against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of

<P>bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of

<P>roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the

<P>window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing
there?

<P>Have you washed your hands and face this morning?' I gave another

<P>tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its

<P>bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone

<P>sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I

<P>replied-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?
You

<P>look quite red, as if you have been about some mischief: what were you

<P>opening the window for?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed
in too

<P>great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the

<P>washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face

<P>and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head

<P>with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying

<P>me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was

<P>wanted in the breakfast-room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded
if Mrs.

<P>Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the

<P>nursery-door upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I

<P>had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to

<P>the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become

<P>for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room

<P>door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable

<P>little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of

<P>me in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to

<P>go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation;

<P>the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must

<P>enter.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who could want me?' I asked inwardly, as with both hands
I

<P>turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted

<P>my efforts. 'What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?-

<P>a man or a woman?' The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing

<P>through and curtseying low, I looked up at- a black pillar!- such,

<P>at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow,

<P>sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top

<P>was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she
made a

<P>signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony

<P>stranger with the words: 'This is the little girl respecting whom I

<P>applied to you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where
I stood,

<P>and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes

<P>which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a

<P>bass voice, 'Her size is small: what is her age?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ten years.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So much?' was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his
scrutiny

<P>for some minutes. Presently he addressed me-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your name, little girl?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane Eyre, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a
tall

<P>gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and

<P>they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little
world

<P>held a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by
an

<P>expressive shake of the head, adding soon, 'Perhaps the less said on

<P>that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;'
and

<P>bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the

<P>arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed's. 'Come here,' he said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight
before

<P>him. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with

<P>mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent

<P>teeth!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,' he began,
'especially

<P>a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They go to hell,' was my ready and orthodox answer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what is hell? Can you tell me that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A pit full of fire.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning
there

<P>for ever?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What must you do to avoid it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was

<P>objectionable: 'I must keep in good health, and not die.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How can you keep in good health? Children younger than
you die

<P>daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two

<P>since,- a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to

<P>be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called

<P>hence.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast
my eyes

<P>down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing

<P>myself far enough away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent
of ever

<P>having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent

<P>benefactress.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Benefactress! benefactress!' said I inwardly: 'they all
call

<P>Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable

<P>thing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you say your prayers night and morning?' continued
my

<P>interrogator.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you read your Bible?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sometimes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With pleasure? Are you fond of it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis
and

<P>Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and

<P>Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the Psalms? I hope you like them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you,
who knows

<P>six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather

<P>have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he

<P>says: "Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;" says he, "I wish

<P>to be a little angel here below;" he then gets two nuts in

<P>recompense for his infant piety.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Psalms are not interesting,' I remarked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray
to God to

<P>change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart
of

<P>stone and give you a heart of flesh.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to propound a question, touching the manner
in which

<P>that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs.

<P>Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry

<P>on the conversation herself.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter
which I

<P>wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite

<P>the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her

<P>into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and

<P>teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all,

<P>to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this

<P>in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr.

<P>Brocklehurst.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for
it was

<P>her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence;

<P>however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please

<P>her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as

<P>the above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to

<P>the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope

<P>from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I

<P>felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was

<P>sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself

<P>transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious

<P>child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing, indeed,' thought I, as I struggled to repress
a sob,

<P>and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my

<P>anguish.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,' said Mr. Brocklehurst;

<P>'it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the

<P>lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be

<P>watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting
her

<P>prospects,' continued my benefactress; 'to be made useful, to be

<P>kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission,

<P>spend them always at Lowood.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,' returned
Mr.

<P>Brocklehurst. 'Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly

<P>appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that

<P>especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I

<P>have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of

<P>pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my

<P>success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit

<P>the school, and on her return she exclaimed: "Oh, dear papa, how quiet

<P>and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed

<P>behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little

<P>holland pockets outside their frocks- they are almost like poor

<P>people's children! and," said she, "they looked at my dress and

<P>mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is the state of things I quite approve,' returned
Mrs.

<P>Reed; 'had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a

<P>system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my

<P>dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties;
and it has

<P>been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment
of

<P>Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,

<P>hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and

<P>its inhabitants.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being
received

<P>as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her

<P>position and prospects?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of
chosen

<P>plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable

<P>privilege of her election.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst;
for,

<P>I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that

<P>was becoming too irksome.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.
I

<P>shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my

<P>good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.
I

<P>shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so

<P>that there will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss

<P>Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton

<P>Brocklehurst.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the
Child's

<P>Guide; read it with prayer, especially that part containing "An

<P>addicted to falsehood and deceit."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin

<P>pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he

<P>departed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in
silence;

<P>she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time

<P>some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame,

<P>square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout,

<P>not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much

<P>developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and

<P>prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light

<P>eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and

<P>opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a

<P>bell- illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager;

<P>her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her

<P>children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;

<P>she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off

<P>handsome attire.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair,
I

<P>examined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the

<P>tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my

<P>attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just

<P>passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the

<P>whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in
my

<P>mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly,

<P>and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine,
her

<P>fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go out of the room; return to the nursery,' was her mandate.
My

<P>look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she

<P>spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to

<P>the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the

<P>room, then close up to her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must
turn: but

<P>how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I

<P>gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you;
but I

<P>declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the

<P>world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give

<P>to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye
of ice

<P>continued to dwell freezingly on mine.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What more have you to say?' she asked, rather in the tone
in which

<P>a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is

<P>ordinarily used to a child.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I
had. Shaking

<P>from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call
you

<P>aunt again so long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am

<P>grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you

<P>treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that

<P>you treated me with miserable cruelty.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth.
You

<P>think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love
or

<P>kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember

<P>how you thrust me back- roughly and violently thrust me back- into the

<P>red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in

<P>agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, "Have

<P>mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!" And that punishment you made me

<P>suffer because your wicked boy struck me- knocked me down for nothing.

<P>I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People

<P>think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are

<P>deceitful!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand,
to exult,

<P>with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It

<P>seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out

<P>into unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs.

<P>Reed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was

<P>lifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting

<P>her face as if she would cry.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with
you? Why do

<P>you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Mrs. Reed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you,
I

<P>desire to be your friend.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character,
a

<P>deceitful disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what

<P>you are, and what you have done.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you don't understand these things: children must
be

<P>corrected for their faults.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Deceit is not my fault!' I cried out in a savage, high
voice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and
now

<P>return to the nursery- there's a dear- and lie down a little.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school
soon,

<P>Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will indeed send her to school soon,' murmured Mrs.
Reed sotto

<P>voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was left there alone- winner of the field. It was the
hardest

<P>battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood

<P>awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed

<P>my conqueror's solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but

<P>this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated

<P>throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had

<P>done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had

<P>given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and

<P>the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing,

<P>devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and

<P>menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the

<P>flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent

<P>condition, when half an hour's silence and reflection had shown me the

<P>madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating

<P>position.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time;
as aromatic

<P>wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,

<P>metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.

<P>Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I

<P>knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the

<P>way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting

<P>every turbulent impulse of my nature.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of
fierce

<P>speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than

<P>that of sombre indignation. I took a book- some Arabian tales; I sat

<P>down and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject;
my

<P>own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found

<P>fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the

<P>shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun
or

<P>breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt

<P>of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which

<P>was quite sequestered; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees,

<P>the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet

<P>leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I

<P>leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep

<P>were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was

<P>a very grey day; a most opaque sky, 'onding on snaw,' canopied all;

<P>thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and
on

<P>the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough,

<P>whispering to myself over and over again, 'What shall I do?- what

<P>shall I do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once I heard a clear voice call, 'Miss Jane! where
are

<P>you? Come to lunch!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir;
her light

<P>step came tripping down the path.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You naughty little thing!' she said. 'Why don't you come
when

<P>you are called?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which
I had been

<P>brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat

<P>cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,

<P>I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory

<P>anger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of

<P>heart. I just put my two arms round her and said, 'Come, Bessie! don't

<P>scold.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated
to

<P>indulge in: somehow it pleased her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are a strange child, Miss Jane,' she said, as she
looked

<P>down at me; 'a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to

<P>school, I suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.
You

<P>should be bolder.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! to get more knocks?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that's certain.
My mother

<P>said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a

<P>little one of her own to be in your place.- Now, come in, and I've

<P>some good news for you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think you have, Bessie.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on
me!

<P>Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out
to

<P>tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I'll ask cook to

<P>bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your

<P>drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave

<P>Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like

<P>to take with you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till
I go.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't
be

<P>afraid of me. Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply;

<P>it's so provoking.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie,
because

<P>I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people
to

<P>dread.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you dread them they'll dislike you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As you do, Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't dislike you, Miss: I believe I am fonder of you
than of

<P>all the others.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't show it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of
talking.

<P>What makes you so venturesome and hardy?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides'- I was
going to

<P>say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on

<P>second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so you're glad to leave me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it!
I daresay

<P>now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say

<P>you'd rather not.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.' Bessie
stooped;

<P>we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite

<P>comforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the

<P>evening Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and sang

<P>me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of

<P>sunshine.
