<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; TWO days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman
has set

<P>me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for

<P>the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in

<P>the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this

<P>moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket
of

<P>the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there

<P>it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone
pillar

<P>set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more

<P>obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its

<P>summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the

<P>inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the

<P>well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted;

<P>a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain:

<P>this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there

<P>are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The

<P>population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these

<P>roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south-white, broad,

<P>lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and

<P>wild to their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and

<P>I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing,

<P>lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I

<P>might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound

<P>incredible and excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society

<P>at this moment- not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures

<P>are- none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me.

<P>I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her

<P>breast and ask repose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow
I saw

<P>deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark

<P>growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened

<P>granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of

<P>moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had
a vague

<P>dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or

<P>poacher might discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked

<P>up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I

<P>imagined it a man. Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and

<P>calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at

<P>nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only

<P>listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions,
when I

<P>could do nothing and go nowhere!- when a long way must yet be measured

<P>by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation-

<P>when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging:

<P>reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before

<P>my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the
heat of

<P>the summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star

<P>twinkled just above the chasm ridge. The day fell, but with propitious

<P>softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good;

<P>I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could

<P>anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with

<P>filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was

<P>her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price.
I

<P>had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a

<P>town we passed through at noon with a stray penny- my last coin. I saw

<P>ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the

<P>heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger,

<P>sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit's meal.
I

<P>said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down
my feet

<P>were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow

<P>space for the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and

<P>spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.

<P>Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement of the night,

<P>cold.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart
broke it.

<P>It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven

<P>chords. It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him

<P>with bitter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and,

<P>impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its

<P>shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.
Night

<P>was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too

<P>serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is

<P>everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are

<P>on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded

<P>night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read

<P>clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had

<P>risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with

<P>tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was-

<P>what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light-
I

<P>felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to

<P>save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should

<P>perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to

<P>thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits.

<P>Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God's, and by God would he be

<P>guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in

<P>sleep forgot sorrow.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after
the

<P>little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the

<P>sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried-

<P>when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth

<P>and sky- I got up, and I looked round me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this
spreading

<P>moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I

<P>saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet

<P>bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that

<P>I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I

<P>was a human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger

<P>where there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the

<P>bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this- that my

<P>Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I

<P>slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further

<P>conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in

<P>peace with the soil of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my

<P>possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and

<P>responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for;

<P>the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the
sun, now

<P>fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my

<P>choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done

<P>enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost

<P>overpowered me- might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on
a

<P>stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart

<P>and limb- I heard a bell chime- a church bell.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst
the

<P>romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an

<P>hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right

<P>hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a

<P>glittering stream ran zigzag through the varied shades of green, the

<P>mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.

<P>Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a

<P>heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were

<P>two cows and their drover. Human life and human labour were near. I

<P>must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About two o'clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom
of

<P>its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the

<P>window. I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could

<P>perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult

<P>to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned
to

<P>me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be

<P>degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I

<P>nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I

<P>considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I

<P>had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities
of

<P>destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles

<P>would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed

<P>person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How

<P>could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter

<P>the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn

<P>gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be

<P>absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.

<P>Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to

<P>my request. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged

<P>to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be,

<P>I restrained it. Soon I asked her 'if there were any dressmaker or

<P>plain-workwoman in the village?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment
for.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought
face to

<P>face with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a

<P>resource, without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What?

<P>I must apply somewhere. Where?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a
servant was

<P>wanted?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; she couldn't say.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What was the chief trade in this place? What did most
of the

<P>people do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's

<P>needle-factory, and at the foundry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did Mr. Oliver employ women?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; it was men's work.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what do the women do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I knawn't,' was the answer. 'Some does one thing, and
some

<P>another. Poor folk mun get on as they can.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what
claim had

<P>I to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently

<P>wanted. I took leave.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses
to

<P>the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor

<P>see an inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going

<P>sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or

<P>more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I

<P>turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many

<P>minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again

<P>searching something- a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty

<P>little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it,

<P>exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What

<P>business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering

<P>knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the

<P>inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked.

<P>A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such
a

<P>voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame-
a

<P>voice wretchedly low and faltering- I asked if a servant was wanted

<P>here?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' said she; 'we do not keep a servant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?'
I

<P>continued. 'I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I

<P>want some work: no matter what.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek
a place for

<P>me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my

<P>character, position, tale. She shook her head, she 'was sorry she

<P>could give me no information,' and the white door closed, quite gently

<P>and civilly: but it shut me out. If she had held it open a little

<P>longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now

<P>brought low.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where,
besides,

<P>no prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate

<P>to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to

<P>offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with

<P>nature's cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there

<P>was a chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude- rest no rest-

<P>while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and
again I

<P>wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim

<P>to ask- no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime,

<P>the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and

<P>starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me:
I

<P>hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a

<P>garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt

<P>was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place

<P>where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply

<P>to the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman's

<P>function to help- at least with advice- those who wished to help

<P>themselves. I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel

<P>here. Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of

<P>strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and knocked at the

<P>kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was the clergyman in?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would he be in soon?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, he was gone from home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To a distance?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not so far- happen three mile. He had been called away
by the

<P>sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very

<P>likely stay there a fortnight longer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was there any lady of the house?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper';
and of

<P>her, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I

<P>was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more I took off my handkerchief- once more I thought
of the

<P>cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one

<P>mouthful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face

<P>again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and

<P>though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request-

<P>'Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at me with evident suspicion: 'Nay, she never
sold stuff

<P>i' that way.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.

<P>'How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?' she said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would she take my gloves?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No! what could she do with them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some
say

<P>there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but

<P>at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude:

<P>the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too

<P>distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed

<P>none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be

<P>expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is

<P>frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably

<P>so. To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was

<P>it to provide me with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons

<P>who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my

<P>character. And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in

<P>exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to

<P>her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am

<P>sick of the subject.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little before dark I passed a farmhouse, at the open
door of

<P>which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.
I

<P>stopped and said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.'
He

<P>cast on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick

<P>slice from his loaf, and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I

<P>was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a

<P>fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house,
I

<P>sat down and ate it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought
it in

<P>the wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my

<P>rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders

<P>passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change

<P>my quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards

<P>morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not

<P>ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I

<P>sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once

<P>did food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl

<P>about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. 'Will you

<P>give me that?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She stared at me. 'Mother!' she exclaimed, 'there is a
woman

<P>wants me to give her these porridge.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, lass,' replied a voice within, 'give it her if she's
a

<P>beggar. T' pig doesn't want it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hands and
I devoured

<P>it ravenously.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary

<P>bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My strength is quite failing me,' I said in a soliloquy.
'I feel I

<P>cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night?

<P>While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched

<P>ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But

<P>it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness,

<P>chill, and this sense of desolation- this total prostration of hope.

<P>In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot

<P>I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to

<P>retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester

<P>is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature

<P>cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer!

<P>Aid!- direct me!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.
I saw I

<P>had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The

<P>very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by

<P>cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland;

<P>and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the

<P>heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and

<P>the dusky hill.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on
a

<P>frequented road,' I reflected. 'And far better that crows and

<P>ravens- if any ravens there be in these regions- should pick my

<P>flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a

<P>workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained
now only

<P>to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden,

<P>if not secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It

<P>showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew

<P>the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was

<P>getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere

<P>alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the

<P>daylight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the
moor-edge,

<P>vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in

<P>among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. 'That is an ignis

<P>fatuus,' was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.
It

<P>burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. 'Is

<P>it, then, a bonfire just kindled?' I questioned. I watched to see

<P>whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not

<P>enlarge. 'It may be a candle in a house,' I then conjectured; 'but

<P>if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it

<P>within a yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the

<P>door to have it shut in my face.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against
the

<P>ground. I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and

<P>over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting

<P>me afresh to the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still

<P>frost- the friendly numbness of death- it might have pelted on; I

<P>should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its

<P>chilling influence. I rose ere long.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through
the rain.

<P>I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.

<P>It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have

<P>been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in

<P>the height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and

<P>rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the
moor. I

<P>approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the

<P>light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees-

<P>firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of

<P>their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I

<P>drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out

<P>my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough

<P>stones of a low wall- above it, something like palisades, and

<P>within, a high and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish

<P>object gleamed before me: it was a gate- a wicket; it moved on its

<P>hinges as I touched it. On each side stood a sable bush- holly or yew.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette
of a house

<P>rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone

<P>nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared

<P>it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot

<P>out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very

<P>small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller

<P>by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves

<P>clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was

<P>set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or

<P>shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put

<P>aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within.
I

<P>could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser

<P>of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness

<P>and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal

<P>table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt
on

<P>the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat

<P>rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was

<P>knitting a stocking.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed these objects cursorily only- in them there was
nothing

<P>extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,

<P>sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two

<P>young, graceful women- ladies in every point- sat, one in a low

<P>rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning

<P>of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair

<P>necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on

<P>the knee of one girl- in the lap of the other was cushioned a black

<P>cat.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!
Who

<P>were they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at

<P>the table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy

<P>and cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet,

<P>as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot

<P>call them handsome- they were too pale and grave for the word: as they

<P>each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A

<P>stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes,
to

<P>which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the

<P>smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a

<P>dictionary to aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as

<P>silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit

<P>apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall

<P>from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even

<P>fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman's

<P>knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness

<P>at last, it was audible enough to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Listen, Diana,' said one of the absorbed students; 'Franz
and

<P>old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a

<P>dream from which he has awakened in terror- listen!' And in a low

<P>voice she read something, of which not one word was intelligible to

<P>me; for it was in an unknown tongue- neither French nor Latin. Whether

<P>it were Greek or German I could not tell.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is strong,' she said, when she had finished: 'I relish
it.'

<P>The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister,

<P>repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.

<P>At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will

<P>here quote the line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like
a

<P>stroke on sounding brass to me- conveying no meaning:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht."
Good!

<P>good!' she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. 'There you

<P>have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is

<P>worth a hundred pages of fustian. "Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale

<P>meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms." I like

<P>it!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both were again silent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?' asked
the old

<P>woman, looking up from her knitting.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Hannah- a far larger country than England, where
they talk in

<P>no other way.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand
t'one

<P>t'other: and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said,

<P>I guess?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We could probably tell something of what they said, but
not all-

<P>for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don't speak

<P>German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what good does it do you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We mean to teach it some time- or at least the elements,
as they

<P>say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough
for

<P>to-night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think we have: at least I'm tired. Mary, are you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a
language

<P>with no master but a lexicon.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but
glorious

<P>Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking
at a

<P>little gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah:

<P>will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly
saw a

<P>passage: soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she

<P>presently came back.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah, childer!' said she, 'it fair troubles me to go into
yond' room

<P>now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a

<P>corner.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave
before,

<P>looked sad now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But he is in a better place,' continued Hannah: 'we shouldn't
wish

<P>him here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he

<P>had.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You say he never mentioned us?' inquired one of the ladies.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your
father.

<P>He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify;

<P>and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent

<P>for, he fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a

<P>heaviness in his head the next day- that is, a fortnight sin'- and

<P>he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a'most stark when your

<P>brother went into t' chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that's t' last

<P>o' t' old stock- for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart
to

<P>them 'at's gone; for all your mother wor mich i' your way, and

<P>a'most as book-learned. She wor the pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more

<P>like your father.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old
servant

<P>(for such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were

<P>fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of

<P>distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker

<P>than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing

<P>it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's

<P>duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck

<P>ten.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ye'll want your supper, I am sure,' observed Hannah; 'and
so

<P>will Mr. St. John when he comes in.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose;
they seemed

<P>about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so

<P>intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited

<P>in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched

<P>position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than

<P>ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to

<P>touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make

<P>them believe in the truth of my wants and woes- to induce them to

<P>vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and

<P>knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere

<P>chimera. Hannah opened.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you want?' she inquired, in a voice of surprise,
as she

<P>surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May I speak to your mistresses?' I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where
do

<P>you come from?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am a stranger.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is your business here at this hour?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere,
and a morsel

<P>of bread to eat.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's
face.

<P>'I'll give you a piece of bread,' she said, after a pause; 'but we

<P>can't take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do let me speak to your mistresses.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be
roving

<P>about now; it looks very ill.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall
I do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.
Mind you

<P>don't do wrong, that's all. Here is a penny; now go-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.

<P>Don't shut the door:- oh, don't, for God's sake!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must; the rain is driving in-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell the young ladies. Let me see them-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be,
or you

<P>wouldn't make such a noise. Move off.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I must die if I am turned away.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not you. I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that
bring

<P>you about folk's houses at this time o' night. If you've any

<P>followers- housebreakers or such like- anywhere near, you may tell

<P>them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and

<P>dogs, and guns.' Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the

<P>door to and bolted it within.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering- a throe
of true

<P>despair- rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not

<P>another step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned- I

<P>wrung my hands- I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death!

<P>Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this

<P>isolation- this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of

<P>hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone- at least for a moment;

<P>but the last I soon endeavoured to regain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can but die,' I said, 'and I believe in God. Let me
try to

<P>wait His will in silence.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting
back all

<P>my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain

<P>there- dumb and still.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All men must die,' said a voice quite close at hand; 'but
all

<P>are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as

<P>yours would be if you perished here of want.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who or what speaks?' I asked, terrified at the unexpected
sound,

<P>and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A

<P>form was near- what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision

<P>prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the newcomer

<P>appealed to the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it you, Mr. St. John?' cried Hannah.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- yes; open quickly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night
as it is!

<P>Come in- your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe

<P>there are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman- I declare

<P>she is not gone yet!- laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off,

<P>I say!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have
done

<P>your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was

<P>near, and listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar

<P>case- I must at least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass

<P>before me into the house.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within
that

<P>clean, bright kitchen- on the very hearth- trembling, sickening;

<P>conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and

<P>weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old

<P>servant, were all gazing at me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John, who is it?' I heard one ask.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot tell: I found her at the door,' was the reply.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She does look white,' said Hannah.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As white as clay or death,' was responded. 'She will fall:
let her

<P>sit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received
me. I

<P>still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch
some.

<P>But she is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A mere spectre!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is she ill, or only famished?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and
a piece

<P>of bread.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping
between me

<P>and the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk,

<P>and put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity
in

<P>it, and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words,

<P>too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: 'Try to eat.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- try,' repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed
my sodden

<P>bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at

<P>first, eagerly soon.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not too much at first- restrain her,' said the brother;
'she has

<P>had enough.' And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little more, St. John- look at the avidity in her eyes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now-
ask her

<P>her name.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt I could speak, and I answered- 'My name is Jane
Elliott.'

<P>Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume
an

<P>alias.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And where do you live? Where are your friends?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can we send for any one you know?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What account can you give of yourself?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this
house,

<P>and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer

<P>outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off

<P>the mendicant- to resume my natural manner and character. I began once

<P>more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account-

<P>which at present I was far too weak to render- I said after a brief

<P>pause-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, I can give you no details to-night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But what, then,' said he, 'do you expect me to do for
you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing,' I replied. My strength sufficed for but short
answers.

<P>Diana took the word-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you mean,' she asked, 'that we have now given you what
aid

<P>you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy

<P>night?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance,

<P>instinct both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage.

<P>Answering her compassionate gaze with a smile, I said- 'I will trust

<P>you. If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not

<P>turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.
Do

<P>with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse-

<P>my breath is short- I feel a spasm when I speak.' All three surveyed

<P>me, and all three were silent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hannah,' said Mr. St. John, at last, 'let her sit there
at

<P>present, and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the

<P>remainder of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the

<P>parlour and talk the matter over.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned- I
could not

<P>tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat
by

<P>the genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.

<P>Ere long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase;
my

<P>dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I

<P>thanked God- experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of

<P>grateful joy- and slept.
