<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A WEEK passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten
days,

<P>and still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be

<P>surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and

<P>thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for

<P>a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite

<P>as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel
a

<P>strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting

<P>myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying

<P>my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my

<P>sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary

<P>blunder- how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester's

<P>movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital

<P>interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of

<P>inferiority: on the contrary, I just said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield,
further than

<P>to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to

<P>be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do

<P>your duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is

<P>the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't

<P>make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and

<P>so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too

<P>self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and

<P>strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and
anon

<P>vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I

<P>should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing

<P>advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these

<P>thoughts I did not think it necessary to check; they might germinate

<P>and bear fruit if they could.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when
the post

<P>brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is from the master,' said she, as she looked at the

<P>direction. 'Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his

<P>return or not.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And while she broke the seal and perused the document,
I went on

<P>taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I

<P>attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to
my

<P>face. Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the

<P>contents of my cup into my saucer, I did not choose to consider.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a
chance of

<P>being busy enough now: for a little while at least,' said Mrs.

<P>Fairfax, still holding the note before her spectacles.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied
the string

<P>of Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her

<P>also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said

<P>nonchalantly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed he is- in three days, he says: that will be next

<P>Thursday; and not alone either. I don't know how many of the fine

<P>people at the Leas are coming with him: he sends directions for all

<P>the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms

<P>are to be cleaned out; and I am to get more kitchen hands from the

<P>George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the

<P>ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we

<P>shall have a full house of it.' And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her

<P>breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.
I had

<P>thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well

<P>arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help;

<P>and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating

<P>of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such

<P>polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in

<P>bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never

<P>beheld, either before or since. Adele ran quite wild in the midst of

<P>it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival,

<P>seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over

<P>all her 'toilettes,' as she called frocks; to furbish up any that were

<P>'passees,' and to air and arrange the new. For herself, she did

<P>nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the

<P>bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows

<P>before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From school

<P>duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her

<P>service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering)

<P>her and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and

<P>French pastry, to truss game and garnish dessert-dishes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon,
in time

<P>for dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to

<P>nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody-

<P>Adele excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to

<P>my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the

<P>region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I

<P>chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had

<P>always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form

<P>of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I

<P>watched her glide along the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list

<P>slipper; when I saw her look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,-

<P>just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to

<P>polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from

<P>papered walls, and then pass on. She would thus descend to the kitchen

<P>once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and

<P>go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her private

<P>solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the

<P>twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the

<P>rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the

<P>second storey: there she sat and sewed- and probably laughed

<P>drearily to herself,- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the
house,

<P>except me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one

<P>discussed her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or

<P>isolation. I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah

<P>and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah

<P>had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman

<P>remarked-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She gets good wages, I guess?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' said Leah; 'I wish I had as good; not that mine
are to

<P>complain of,- there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one

<P>fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes

<P>every quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has

<P>saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I

<P>suppose she's got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and

<P>strong and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up

<P>business.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is a good hand, I daresay,' said the charwoman.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah!- she understands what she has to do,- nobody better,'
rejoined

<P>Leah significantly; 'and it is not every one could fill her shoes- not

<P>for all the money she gets.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That it is not!' was the reply. 'I wonder whether the
master-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived

<P>me, and she instantly gave her companion a nudge.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Doesn't she know?' I heard the woman whisper.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course
dropped.

<P>All I had gathered from it amounted to this,- that there was a mystery

<P>at Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was

<P>purposely excluded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous
evening;

<P>carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white

<P>counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers

<P>piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright

<P>as hands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great

<P>carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase,

<P>were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the

<P>sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and

<P>boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black
satin

<P>gown, her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive

<P>the company,- to conduct the ladies to their rooms, etc. Adele, too,

<P>would be dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being

<P>introduced to the party that day at least. However, to please her, I

<P>allowed Sophie to apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.

<P>For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called

<P>upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now

<P>become to me,- 'a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been a mild, serene spring day- one of those days
which,

<P>towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining

<P>over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but

<P>the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with

<P>the window open.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It gets late,' said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling
state. 'I

<P>am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester

<P>mentioned; for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the

<P>gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long

<P>way from thence in the direction of Millcote.' She went to the window.

<P>'Here he is!' said she. 'Well, John' (leaning out), 'any news?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They're coming, ma'am,' was the answer. 'They'll be here
in ten

<P>minutes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand
on one

<P>side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being

<P>seen.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at
last wheels

<P>were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them

<P>came two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the

<P>vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking

<P>gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour,

<P>Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she

<P>were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the,

<P>ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its

<P>transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven

<P>ringlets.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Ingram!' exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried
to

<P>her post below.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly
turned the

<P>angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adele now petitioned to
go

<P>down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she

<P>must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,

<P>either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr.

<P>Rochester would be very angry, etc. 'Some natural tears she shed' on

<P>being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at

<P>last to wipe them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's
deep tones

<P>and ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and

<P>distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice

<P>of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant

<P>guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there

<P>was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and

<P>opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Elles changent de toilettes,' said Adele; who, listening

<P>attentively, had followed every movement; and she sighed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Chez maman,' said she, 'quand il y avait du monde, je
le suivais

<P>partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes

<P>de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme

<P>cela on apprend.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't you feel hungry, Adele?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous

<P>n'avons pas mange.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will
venture down

<P>and get you something to eat.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a
backstairs

<P>which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire

<P>and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection,

<P>and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body

<P>threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants' hall two coachmen

<P>and three gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the

<P>abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new

<P>servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about

<P>everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder;

<P>there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some

<P>tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a

<P>hasty retreat. I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the

<P>back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies

<P>were about to issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the

<P>schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk

<P>of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at

<P>this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the

<P>sun was set and twilight gathering.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after

<P>another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed

<P>lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together
at

<P>the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet

<P>subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as

<P>noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective

<P>appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such
as

<P>I had never before received.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which
she held

<P>ajar. 'What beautiful ladies!' cried she in English. 'Oh, I wish I

<P>might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by and

<P>by, after dinner?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else
to think

<P>about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them

<P>to-morrow: here is your dinner.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served
to divert

<P>her attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both

<P>she, I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would

<P>have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs

<P>was too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out

<P>till after nine, and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with

<P>trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Adele to sit up much later than

<P>usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the

<P>doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about.

<P>Besides, she added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester

<P>when she was undressed; 'et alors quel dommage!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her stories as long as she would listen to them;
and then

<P>for a change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now

<P>lit, and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the

<P>servants passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far

<P>advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the

<P>piano had been removed; Adele and I sat down on the top step of the

<P>stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the

<P>instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The

<P>solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational

<P>murmur filled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered

<P>that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and

<P>trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr.

<P>Rochester; and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a

<P>further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance

<P>inarticulate, into words.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adele, whose head
leant

<P>against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in

<P>my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the

<P>gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted
by

<P>the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They

<P>set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in

<P>carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram,

<P>as before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester

<P>galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I

<P>pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the

<P>window with me-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said it was not likely they should think of being
married,'

<P>said I, 'but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the

<P>other ladies.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And she him,' I added; 'look how she leans her head towards
him as

<P>if she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face;

<P>I have never had a glimpse of it yet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will see her this evening,' answered Mrs. Fairfax.
'I happened

<P>to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to

<P>the ladies, and he said: "Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after

<P>dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go,
I am sure,'

<P>I answered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company,
I

<P>did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party- all

<P>strangers; and he replied, in his quick way- "Nonsense! If she

<P>objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say

<P>I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will not give him that trouble,' I answered. 'I will
go, if no

<P>better may be; but I don't like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I'll tell
you how to

<P>manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance,

<P>which is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go

<P>into the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the

<P>dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need

<P>not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let

<P>Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away- nobody will notice

<P>you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will these people remain long, do you think?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After
the Easter

<P>recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote,

<P>will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr.

<P>Rochester will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made

<P>so protracted a stay at Thornfield.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour
approach

<P>when I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adele had

<P>been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be

<P>presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie

<P>commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then

<P>the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time

<P>she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her

<P>pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens

<P>adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not
to

<P>disarrange her attire: when she was dressed, she sat demurely down

<P>in her little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt

<P>for fear she should crease it, and assured me she would not stir

<P>thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my best dress (the

<P>silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's wedding, and never worn

<P>since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament,

<P>the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room
than

<P>that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found

<P>the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble

<P>hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite

<P>flowers with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung

<P>before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from

<P>the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that

<P>nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing

<P>murmur.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of
a most

<P>solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I

<P>pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from

<P>a table near, endeavoured to read. Adele brought her stool to my feet;

<P>ere long she touched my knee.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is it, Adele?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs

<P>magnifiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You think too much of your "toilette," Adele: but you
may have a

<P>flower.' And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.

<P>She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of

<P>happiness were now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I

<P>could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful

<P>in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of

<P>dress.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain
was swept

<P>back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its

<P>lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent

<P>dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the

<P>opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in,
they gave

<P>the impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall;

<P>many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of

<P>array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the

<P>moon. I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in

<P>return, the others only stared at me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness
and

<P>buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some

<P>of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas

<P>and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and

<P>books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a

<P>low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names

<P>afterwards, and may as well mention them now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.
She had

<P>evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of

<P>her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and

<P>child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin

<P>dress and blue sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller

<P>and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the

<P>French term minois chiffone: both sisters were fair as lilies.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty,
very

<P>erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of

<P>changeful sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an

<P>azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more
lady-like.

<P>She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black

<P>satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl

<P>ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled

<P>dame.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the three most distinguished- partly, perhaps, because
the

<P>tallest figures of the band- were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her

<P>daughters, Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest

<P>stature of women. The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her

<P>shape was still fine; her hair (by candlelight at least) still

<P>black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people

<P>would have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was,

<P>no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of

<P>almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She

<P>had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat

<P>like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and

<P>darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained

<P>by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural

<P>erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded

<P>me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was

<P>deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,- very

<P>intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of

<P>some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she

<P>thought) with a truly imperial dignity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,- straight and tall
as

<P>poplars. Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded

<P>like a Dian. I regarded her, of course, with special interest.

<P>First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs.

<P>Fairfax's description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy

<P>miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly- it will out!- whether

<P>it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as person went, she answered point for point, both
to my

<P>picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description. The noble bust, the sloping

<P>shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were

<P>all there;- but her face? Her face was like her mother's; a youthful

<P>unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the

<P>same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed

<P>continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual

<P>expression of her arched and haughty lip.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Genius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether
Miss

<P>Ingram was a genius, but she was self-conscious- remarkably

<P>self-conscious indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the

<P>gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science:

<P>though, as she said, she liked flowers, 'especially wild ones'; Miss

<P>Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently

<P>perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed) trailing Mrs. Dent;

<P>that is, playing on her ignorance: her trail might be clever, but it

<P>was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her execution was

<P>brilliant; she sang, her voice was fine; she talked French apart to

<P>her mama; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche;
softer

<P>features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as
a

<P>Spaniard)- but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,

<P>her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her

<P>seat, remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both

<P>attired in spotless white.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester

<P>would be likely to make? I could not tell- I did not know his taste
in

<P>female beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of

<P>majesty: then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would

<P>admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her, I already seemed
to

<P>have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained

<P>but to see them together.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this
time been

<P>sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies

<P>entered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence,

<P>and said with gravity-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bon jour, mesdames.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air,
and

<P>exclaimed, 'Oh, what a little puppet!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Lynn had remarked, 'It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I
suppose- the

<P>little French girl he was speaking of.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
Amy

<P>and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a love of a child!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat,

<P>ensconced between them, chattering alternately in French and broken

<P>English; absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of

<P>Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.
I sit

<P>in the shade- if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment;

<P>the window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The

<P>collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is

<P>very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are

<P>tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks

<P>indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the

<P>magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite

<P>white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him something

<P>of the appearance of a 'pere noble de theatre.' Lord Ingram, like

<P>his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he

<P>shares Mary's apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more

<P>length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And where is Mr. Rochester?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see
him

<P>enter. I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles,

<P>on the meshes of the purse I am forming- I wish to think only of the

<P>work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads

<P>that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I

<P>inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I had

<P>rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding
my

<P>hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed

<P>a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.

<P>How near had I approached him at that moment! What had occurred since,

<P>calculated to change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how

<P>distant, how far estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not

<P>expect him to come and speak to me. I did not wonder, when, without

<P>looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began

<P>conversing with some of the ladies.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them,
and

<P>that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn

<P>involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under

<P>control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked,

<P>and had an acute pleasure in looking,- a precious yet poignant

<P>pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like

<P>what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which

<P>he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts

<P>nevertheless.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most true is it that 'beauty is in the eye of the gazer.'
My

<P>master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty

<P>eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,- all energy,

<P>decision, will,- were not beautiful, according to rule; but they

<P>were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an

<P>influence that quite mastered me,- that took my feelings from my own

<P>power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the

<P>reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs
of

<P>love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they

<P>spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without

<P>looking at me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace
of the

<P>Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,- even the military

<P>distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith

<P>and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their

<P>expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them

<P>attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.

<P>Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them

<P>smile, laugh- it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much

<P>soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance

<P>as their laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:- his stern features

<P>softened; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both

<P>searching and sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and

<P>Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which

<P>seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their

<P>colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no

<P>sense moved. 'He is not to them what he is to me,' I thought: 'he is

<P>not of their kind. I believe he is of mine;- I am sure he is- I feel

<P>akin to him- I understand the language of his countenance and

<P>movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something
in

<P>my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me

<P>mentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to
do

<P>with him but to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself
to

<P>think of him in any other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against

<P>nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers

<P>impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must

<P>smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me. For

<P>when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his

<P>force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I

<P>have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then,

<P>repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:- and yet, while I

<P>breathe and think, I must love him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered,
have

<P>become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel

<P>Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two

<P>proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir

<P>George- whom, by the bye, I have forgotten to describe,- a very big,

<P>and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,

<P>coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick

<P>Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the

<P>engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but

<P>apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with

<P>folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she

<P>glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than

<P>she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an

<P>ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is

<P>trying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders.

<P>With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the

<P>table, bending gracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be

<P>sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself selects a mate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the
hearth

<P>as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking

<P>her station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor am I.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little
doll as

<P>that?' (pointing to Adele). 'Where did you pick her up?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should have sent her to school.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could not afford it: schools are so dear.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person
with

<P>her just now- is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the

<P>window-curtain. You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as

<P>expensive,- more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feared- or should I say, hoped?- the allusion to me would
make

<P>Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into

<P>the shade: but he never turned his eyes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have not considered the subject,' said he indifferently,
looking

<P>straight before him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.
You should

<P>hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should

<P>think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the

<P>rest ridiculous, and all incubi- were they not, mama?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you speak, my own?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property,

<P>reiterated her question with an explanation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes
me

<P>nervous. I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and

<P>caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady, and whispered
something

<P>in her car; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder

<P>that one of the anathematised race was present.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tant pis!' said her ladyship, 'I hope it may do her good!'
Then,

<P>in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, 'I noticed her;

<P>I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her

<P>class.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What are they, madam?' inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will tell you in your private ear,' replied she, wagging
her

<P>turban three times with portentous significancy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves
food now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, don't refer him to me, mama! I have just one word
to say of

<P>the whole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much

<P>from them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and

<P>I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame

<P>Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.

<P>The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly

<P>thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of

<P>vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no

<P>blow took effect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her

<P>raging passions, when we had driven her to extremities- spilt our tea,

<P>crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and

<P>played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.

<P>Theodore, do you remember those merry days?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yaas, to be sure I do,' drawled Lord Ingram; 'and the
poor old

<P>stick used to cry out "Oh you villains childs!"- and then we

<P>sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever

<P>blades as we were, when she was herself so ignorant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting
(or

<P>persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining- the parson in the pip,

<P>as we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling

<P>in love with each other- at least Tedo and I thought so; we

<P>surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as

<P>tokens of "la belle passion," and I promise you the public soon had

<P>the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to

<P>hoist our dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as

<P>she got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an

<P>immoral tendency. Did you not, my lady-mother?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that:
there

<P>are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors

<P>should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house;

<P>firstly-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste,
we all

<P>know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood;

<P>distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the

<P>attached- mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting-

<P>insolence accompanying- mutiny and general blowup. Am I right,

<P>Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then no more need be said: change the subject.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined
in

<P>with her soft, infantine tone: 'Louisa and I used to quiz our

<P>governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear

<P>anything: nothing put her out. She was never cross with us; was she,

<P>Louisa?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk
and her

<P>workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,

<P>she would give us anything we asked for.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose, now,' said Miss Ingram, curling her lip

<P>sarcastically, 'we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the

<P>governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again

<P>move the introduction of a new topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second

<P>my motion?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior
Eduardo,

<P>are you in voice to-night?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish
up your

<P>lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal

<P>service.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A fig for Rizzio!' cried she, tossing her head with all
its curls,

<P>as she moved to the piano. 'It is my opinion the fiddler David must

<P>have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better:

<P>to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and

<P>history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion,
he

<P>was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have

<P>consented to gift with my hand.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?'

<P>cried Mr. Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should say the preference lies with you,' responded
Colonel

<P>Dent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On my honour, I am much obliged to you,' was the reply.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace
at the

<P>piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced
a

<P>brilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high

<P>horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite

<P>not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was

<P>evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring

<P>indeed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!'
exclaimed

<P>she, rattling away at the instrument. 'Poor, puny things, not fit to

<P>stir a step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without

<P>mama's permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care

<P>about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet;

<P>as if a man had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were

<P>not the special prerogative of woman- her legitimate appanage and

<P>heritage! I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of

<P>creation; but as to the gentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess

<P>only strength and valour: let their motto be:- Hunt, shoot, and fight:

<P>the rest is not worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a

<P>man.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whenever I marry,' she continued after a pause which none

<P>interrupted, 'I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a

<P>foil to me. I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact

<P>an undivided homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me

<P>and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I

<P>will play for you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am all obedience,' was the response.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs;
and for

<P>that reason, sing it con spirito.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into
a mug of

<P>milk and water.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame
you by

<P>showing how such things should be done.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now
endeavour to

<P>fail.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise
a

<P>proportionate punishment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her
power to

<P>inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ha! explain!' commanded the lady.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine
sense must

<P>inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute

<P>for capital punishment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sing!' said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced
an

<P>accompaniment in spirited style.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now is my time to slip away,' thought I: but the tones
that then

<P>severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester

<P>possessed a fine voice: he did- a mellow, powerful bass, into which
he

<P>threw his own feeling, his own force: finding a way through the ear
to

<P>the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the

<P>last deep and full vibration had expired- till the tide of talk,

<P>checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my

<P>sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was

<P>fortunately near. Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in

<P>crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped to tie it,

<P>kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the

<P>staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;

<P>rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you do?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very well, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I might have retorted the question on him who
put it: but

<P>I would not take that freedom. I answered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged,
sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What have you been doing during my absence?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And getting a good deal paler than you were- as I saw
at first

<P>sight. What is the matter?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing at all, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not the least.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am tired, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me for a minute.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And a little depressed,' he said. 'What about? Tell me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing- nothing, sir. I am not depressed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few
more words

<P>would bring tears to your eyes- indeed, they are there now, shining

<P>and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to

<P>the flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating

<P>prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means. Well,

<P>to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors

<P>stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it

<P>is my wish; don't neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.

<P>Good-night, my-' He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
