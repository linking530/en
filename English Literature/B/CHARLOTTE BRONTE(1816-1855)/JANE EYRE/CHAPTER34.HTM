<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; IT was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the
season of

<P>general holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care

<P>that the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens

<P>the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when

<P>we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual

<P>ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that

<P>many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that

<P>consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly

<P>and strongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place

<P>in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week

<P>should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an

<P>hour's teaching in their school.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering
sixty

<P>girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key

<P>in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some

<P>half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and

<P>well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the

<P>British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the

<P>British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most

<P>self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen

<P>paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me

<P>ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you consider you have got your reward for a season
of

<P>exertion?' asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. 'Does not the

<P>consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation

<P>give pleasure?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Doubtless.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life
devoted to

<P>the task of regenerating your race be well spent?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' I said; 'but I could not go on for ever so: I want
to

<P>enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other

<P>people. I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body

<P>to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked grave. 'What now? What sudden eagerness is this
you

<P>evince? What are you going to do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg
you to

<P>set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you want her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will
be at home

<P>in a week, and I want to have everything in order against their

<P>arrival.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some
excursion.

<P>It is better so: Hannah shall go with you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the
schoolroom

<P>key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He took it. 'You give it up very gleefully,' said he; 'I
don't

<P>quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what

<P>employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are

<P>relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have

<P>you now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend
the full

<P>force of the expression?)- to clean down Moor House from chamber to

<P>cellar; my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite

<P>number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every

<P>chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I

<P>shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in

<P>every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your

<P>sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a

<P>beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding

<P>of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and

<P>solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an

<P>inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you. My purpose, in

<P>short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of

<P>readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition

<P>is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is all very well for the present,' said he; 'but seriously,
I

<P>trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a

<P>little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace
I allow

<P>you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing

<P>yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but then, I

<P>hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly

<P>society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised

<P>affluence. I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with

<P>their strength.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at him with surprise. 'St. John,' I said, 'I think
you are

<P>almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen,

<P>and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To the end of turning to profit the talents which God
has

<P>committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day

<P>demand a strict account. Jane, I shall watch you closely and

<P>anxiously- I warn you of that. And try to restrain the

<P>disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into

<P>commonplace home pleasures. Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of

<P>the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause;

<P>forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have
adequate

<P>cause to be happy, and I will be happy. Good-bye!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did
Hannah:

<P>she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a

<P>house turned topsy-turvy- how I could brush, and dust, and clean,

<P>and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse

<P>confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the

<P>to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me carte

<P>blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been

<P>set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I

<P>left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more

<P>pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and

<P>beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still

<P>some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy

<P>with which I wished it to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and

<P>curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique

<P>ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and

<P>dressing-cases, for the toilet-tables, answered the end: they looked

<P>fresh without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished

<P>entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on

<P>the passage, and carpets on the stairs. When all was finished, I

<P>thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness

<P>within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and

<P>desert dreariness without.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected
about

<P>dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen

<P>was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in

<P>readiness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite
clear

<P>of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare

<P>idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its

<P>walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the

<P>kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then

<P>baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, 'If I was at last

<P>satisfied with housemaid's work?' I answered by inviting him to

<P>accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours. With

<P>some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the house. He just

<P>looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and

<P>downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue

<P>and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a

<P>time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the

<P>improved aspect of his abode.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations
had

<P>disturbed some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was

<P>the case: no doubt in a somewhat crestfallen tone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had

<P>scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must

<P>have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many

<P>minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of

<P>this very room?- By the bye, could I tell him where such a book was?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down,
and

<P>withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man;
but I

<P>began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was

<P>hard and cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no

<P>attraction for him- its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he

<P>lived only to aspire- after what was good and great, certainly; but

<P>still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting round him.
As

<P>I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone- at

<P>his fine lineaments fixed in study- I comprehended all at once that
he

<P>would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to

<P>be his wife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love

<P>for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him that it was but a love of the

<P>senses. I comprehended how he should despise himself for the

<P>feverish influence it exercised over him; how he should wish to stifle

<P>and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever conducing

<P>permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material

<P>from which nature hews her heroes- Christian and Pagan- her lawgivers,

<P>her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests

<P>to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous

<P>column, gloomy and out of place.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This parlour is not his sphere,' I reflected: 'the Himalayan
ridge

<P>or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit

<P>him better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not

<P>his element: there his faculties stagnate- they cannot develop or

<P>appear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger- where

<P>courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked- that
he

<P>will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have

<P>the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a

<P>missionary's career- I see it now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are coming! they are coming!' cried Hannah, throwing
open the

<P>parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran.

<P>It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had

<P>a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver

<P>opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.

<P>In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with

<P>Mary's soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls. They laughed-

<P>kissed me- then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with

<P>delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the

<P>affirmative, hastened into the house.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from
Whitcross,

<P>and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances

<P>expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah

<P>brought in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he

<P>advanced from the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck

<P>at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words

<P>of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that

<P>he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew

<P>there as to a place of refuge.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first
to give

<P>hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed

<P>me. They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their

<P>rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted

<P>china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had

<P>the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly,

<P>and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return

<P>home.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration,
were so

<P>eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St.

<P>John's taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in

<P>their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The

<P>event of the day- that is, the return of Diana and Mary- pleased

<P>him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the

<P>garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer

<P>morrow was come. In the very meridian of the night's enjoyment,

<P>about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered

<P>with the intimation that 'a poor lad was come, at that unlikely

<P>time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where does she live, Hannah?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and
moor and

<P>moss all the way.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell him I will go.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm sure, sir, you had better not. It's the worst road
to travel

<P>after dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog. And then

<P>it is such a bitter night- the keenest wind you ever felt. You had

<P>better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak;
and

<P>without one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine

<P>o'clock: he did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough

<P>he was: but he looked happier than when he set out. He had performed

<P>an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and

<P>deny, and was on better terms with himself.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.
It

<P>was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it

<P>in a sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the

<P>freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's

<P>spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning

<P>till noon, and from noon till night. They could always talk; and their

<P>discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I

<P>preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St.

<P>John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was

<P>seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered,

<P>and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its

<P>different districts.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little
pensive for

<P>some minutes, asked him, 'If his plans were yet unchanged.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Unchanged and unchangeable,' was the reply. And he proceeded
to

<P>inform us that his departure from England was now definitely fixed for

<P>the ensuing year.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Rosamond Oliver?' suggested Mary, the words seeming
to

<P>escape her lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them,

<P>than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a

<P>book in his hand- it was his unsocial custom to read at meals- he

<P>closed it, and looked up.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rosamond Oliver,' said he, 'is about to be married to
Mr.

<P>Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in

<P>from her father yesterday.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three
looked

<P>at him: he was serene as glass.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The match must have been got up hastily,' said Diana:
'they cannot

<P>have known each other long.'

<P>But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case,

<P>where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are

<P>Frederic gives up to them, can be refitted for their reception.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time I found St. John alone after this communication,
I

<P>felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed

<P>so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him

<P>more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had

<P>already hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him:

<P>his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed

<P>beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his

<P>sisters; he continually made little, chilling differences between

<P>us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in

<P>short, now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under

<P>the same roof with him, I felt the distance between us to be far

<P>greater than when he had known me only as the village

<P>schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted

<P>to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when
he raised

<P>his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately
reply:

<P>after a moment's hesitation I answered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But are you sure you are not in the position of those
conquerors

<P>whose triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin

<P>you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify;
I shall

<P>never be called upon to contend for such another. The event of the

<P>conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!' So

<P>saying, he returned to his papers and his silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana's, Mary's, and mine)
settled

<P>into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and

<P>regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the

<P>same room, sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana

<P>pursued a course of encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and

<P>amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he pondered a

<P>mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition

<P>of which he thought necessary to his plans.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet
and

<P>absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the

<P>outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing

<P>upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:

<P>if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it

<P>returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I

<P>wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit

<P>on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly

<P>visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the

<P>day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and

<P>his sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of

<P>their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without

<P>regard to the elements.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,' he
would

<P>say: 'she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of

<P>snow, as well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and

<P>elastic;- better calculated to endure variations of climate than

<P>many more robust.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not
a

<P>little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to

<P>murmur would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him;

<P>the reverse was a special annoyance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because
I

<P>really had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I

<P>sat reading Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.
As

<P>I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way:

<P>there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue

<P>eye. How long it had been searching me through and through, and over

<P>and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for

<P>the moment superstitious- as if I were sitting in the room with

<P>something uncanny.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, what are you doing?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Learning German.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are not in earnest?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell
you why.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language
he was

<P>himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to

<P>forget the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a

<P>pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements, and

<P>so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for

<P>some time between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me

<P>because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would
I

<P>do him this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the

<P>sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt
that every

<P>impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved

<P>and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former

<P>found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed,

<P>and both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded

<P>them to such a step. He answered quietly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an
exacting

<P>master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his

<P>expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.

<P>By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away

<P>my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than

<P>his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was

<P>by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that

<P>vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware

<P>that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his

<P>presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I

<P>fell under a freezing spell. When he said 'go,' I went; 'come,' I

<P>came; 'do this,' I did it. But I did not love my servitude: I

<P>wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round
him,

<P>bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom;

<P>and, as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who

<P>chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (she was not painfully controlled

<P>by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but
you don't

<P>treat her as such: you should kiss her too.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking,
and felt

<P>uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.

<P>John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine,

<P>his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly- he kissed me. There are no

<P>such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my

<P>ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but

<P>there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When

<P>given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am

<P>sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for
I

<P>felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never

<P>omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with

<P>which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain

<P>charm.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do
so, I

<P>felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle

<P>half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force

<P>myself to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural

<P>vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach;

<P>it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing

<P>was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and

<P>classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint

<P>and solemn lustre of his own.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at
present. Of

<P>late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil

<P>sat in my heart and drained my happiness at its source- the evil of

<P>suspense.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader,
amidst

<P>these changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was

<P>still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse,

<P>nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name

<P>graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it

<P>inscribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me

<P>everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every

<P>evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom

<P>each night to brood over it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs

<P>about the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr.

<P>Rochester's present residence and state of health; but, as St. John

<P>had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then

<P>wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject. I had

<P>calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt sure

<P>it would elicit an early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight

<P>passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day

<P>the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the

<P>keenest anxiety.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having
missed.

<P>Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for

<P>some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word

<P>reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died

<P>out, and then I felt dark indeed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.
Summer

<P>approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished

<P>to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I

<P>did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too

<P>purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying

<P>deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee,

<P>and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like

<P>a fool, never thought of resisting him- I could not resist him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than
usual; the

<P>ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had

<P>told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down

<P>to take it, almost certain that the long-looked-for tidings were

<P>vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr.

<P>Briggs on business. The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and

<P>now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing

<P>tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to
do this my

<P>voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only

<P>occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the

<P>drawing-room, Mary was gardening- it was a very fine May day, clear,

<P>sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,

<P>nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.'
And

<P>while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and

<P>patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching

<P>with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a

<P>patient's malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and

<P>muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed

<P>my task, and succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books

<P>and his, locked his desk, and said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will call Diana and Mary.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must
be

<P>you. Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road

<P>towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium
in my

<P>dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own,

<P>between absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always

<P>faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting,

<P>sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither

<P>present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to

<P>mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and

<P>in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side

<P>with him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet
with

<P>scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream

<P>descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along

<P>plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire

<P>tints from the firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod
a

<P>soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a

<P>tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the

<P>hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head,

<P>wound to their very core.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let us rest here,' said St. John, as we reached the first

<P>stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond

<P>which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little

<P>farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for

<P>raiment and crag for gem- where it exaggerated the wild to the savage,

<P>and exchanged the fresh for the frowning- where it guarded the forlorn

<P>hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the
pass and

<P>down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and

<P>returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he

<P>removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He

<P>seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade

<P>farewell to something.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I shall see it again,' he said aloud, 'in dreams when
I

<P>sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour- when another

<P>slumber overcomes me- on the shore of a darker stream!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot's passion
for

<P>his fatherland! He sat down; for half an hour we never spoke;

<P>neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East
Indiaman

<P>which sails on the 20th of June.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,'
I

<P>answered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' said he, 'there is my glory and joy. I am the servant
of

<P>an infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject

<P>to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms:
my

<P>king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange
to

<P>me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,-

<P>to join in the same enterprise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All have not Your powers, and it would be folly for the
feeble

<P>to wish to march with the strong.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address
only

<P>such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them
up- to

<P>urge and exhort them to the effort- to show them what their gifts are,

<P>and why they were given- to speak Heaven's message in their ear,- to

<P>offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If they are really qualified for the task, will not their
own

<P>hearts be the first to inform them of it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering
over

<P>me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once

<P>declare and rivet the spell.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what does your heart say?' demanded St. John.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My heart is mute- my heart is mute,' I answered, struck
and

<P>thrilled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I must speak for it,' continued the deep, relentless
voice.

<P>'Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and

<P>fellow-labourer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as
if I had

<P>heard a summons from Heaven- as if a visionary messenger, like him

<P>of Macedonia, had enounced, 'Come over and help us!' But I was no

<P>apostle,- I could not behold the herald,- I could not receive his

<P>call.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, St. John!' I cried, 'have some mercy!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed
his

<P>duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. It
is not

<P>personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed

<P>for labour, not for love. A missionary's wife you must- shall be.

<P>You shall be mine: I claim you- not for my pleasure, but for my

<P>Sovereign's service.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,' I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had calculated on these first objections: he was not
irritated

<P>by them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded

<P>his arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was

<P>prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock
of

<P>patience to last him to its close- resolved, however, that that

<P>close should be conquest for him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humility, Jane,' said he, 'is the groundwork of Christian
virtues:

<P>you say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it?
Or

<P>who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the

<P>summons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I

<P>acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this

<P>sense of my personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He

<P>is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument

<P>to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His

<P>providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think

<P>like me, Jane- trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean

<P>on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied

<P>missionary labours.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want:
I can

<P>set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you

<P>from moment to moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I

<P>know your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and

<P>would not require my help.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But my powers- where are they for this undertaking? I
do not

<P>feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible

<P>of no light kindling- no life quickening- no voice counselling or

<P>cheering. Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at

<P>this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered

<P>in its depths- the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I

<P>cannot accomplish!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have an answer for you- hear it. I have watched you
ever since

<P>we first met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved

<P>you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?

<P>In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually,

<P>uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw

<P>you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you

<P>controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had become

<P>suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:- lucre had
no

<P>undue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut

<P>your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and

<P>relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I

<P>recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of

<P>sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a

<P>study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it

<P>interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since

<P>persevered in it- in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with

<P>which you have met its difficulties- I acknowledge the complement of

<P>the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,

<P>faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic:

<P>cease to mistrust yourself- I can trust you unreservedly. As a

<P>conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your

<P>assistance will be to me invaluable.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced
with

<P>slow, sure step. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his

<P>succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up,

<P>comparatively clear. My work, which had appeared so vague, so

<P>hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed a

<P>definite form under his shaping hand. He waited for an answer. I

<P>demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a

<P>reply.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very willingly,' he rejoined; and rising, he strode a
little

<P>distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and

<P>there lay still.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and

<P>acknowledge that,' I meditated,- 'that is, if life be spared me. But
I

<P>feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian

<P>sun. What then? He does not care for that: when my time came to die,

<P>he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who

<P>gave me. The case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I

<P>should leave a loved but empty land- Mr. Rochester is not there; and

<P>if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? My business is to

<P>live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from

<P>day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in

<P>circumstances, which might reunite me to him. Of course (as St. John

<P>once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one

<P>lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious

<P>man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime

<P>results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn

<P>affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes- and yet

<P>I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
to

<P>India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval between

<P>leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I

<P>know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to

<P>satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him- to the

<P>finest central point and farthest outward circle of his

<P>expectations. If I do go with him- if I do make the sacrifice he

<P>urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar-

<P>heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will never love me; but he

<P>shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen,

<P>resources he has never suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can,

<P>and with as little grudging.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one
item- one

<P>dreadful item. It is- that he asks me to be his wife, and has no

<P>more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock,

<P>down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a

<P>soldier would a good weapon, and that is all. Unmarried to him, this

<P>would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations-

<P>coolly put into practice his plans- go through the wedding ceremony?

<P>Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love

<P>(which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the

<P>spirit was quite absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every

<P>endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a

<P>martyrdom would be monstrous. I will never undergo it. As his

<P>sister, I might accompany him- not as his wife: I will tell him so.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate

<P>column; his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He

<P>started to his feet and approached me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your answer requires a commentary,' he said; 'it is not
clear.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have hitherto been my adopted brother- I, your adopted
sister:

<P>let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head. 'Adopted fraternity will not do in this
case. If

<P>you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you,

<P>and seek no wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated

<P>and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose

<P>themselves to any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a

<P>moment- your strong sense will guide you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed
me

<P>only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife

<P>should: and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so.

<P>'St. John,' I returned, 'I regard you as a brother- you, me as a

<P>sister: so let us continue.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We cannot- we cannot,' he answered, with short, sharp

<P>determination: 'it would not do. You have said you will go with me

<P>to India: remember- you have said that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Conditionally.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well- well. To the main point- the departure with me from
England,

<P>the co-operation with me in my future labours- you do not object.

<P>You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too

<P>consistent to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view- how

<P>the work you have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your

<P>complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all

<P>considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect- with

<P>power- the mission of your great Master. To do so, you must have a

<P>coadjutor: not a brother- that is a loose tie- but a husband. I,

<P>too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me.

<P>I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in

<P>life, and retain absolutely till death.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow-
his

<P>hold on my limbs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted
to you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One fitted to my purpose, you mean- fitted to my vocation.
Again I

<P>tell you it is not the insignificant private individual- the mere man,

<P>with the man's selfish senses- I wish to mate: it is the missionary.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I will give the missionary my energies- it is all
he wants-

<P>but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the

<P>kernel. For them he has no use: I retain them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You cannot- you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied
with

<P>half an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the

<P>cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I

<P>cannot accept on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I will give my heart to God,' I said. 'You do not
want it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not swear, reader, that there was not something
of repressed

<P>sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in

<P>the feeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till

<P>now, because I had not understood him. He had held me in awe,

<P>because he had held me in doubt. How much of him was saint, how much

<P>mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made

<P>in this conference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before

<P>my eyes. I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I understood

<P>that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that

<P>handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I.

<P>The veil fell from his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him

<P>the presence of these qualities, I felt his imperfection and took

<P>courage. I was with an equal- one with whom I might argue- one whom,

<P>if I saw good, I might resist.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and
I

<P>presently risked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent
on

<P>me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. 'Is she

<P>sarcastic, and sarcastic to me!' it seemed to say. 'What does this

<P>signify?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,' he
said ere

<P>long; 'one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.

<P>I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will give your

<P>heart to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and

<P>fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual

<P>kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will
be

<P>ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what

<P>impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and

<P>mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of

<P>permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings;

<P>and, passing over all minor caprices- all trivial difficulties and

<P>delicacies of feeling- all scruple about the degree, kind, strength
or

<P>tenderness of mere personal inclination- you will hasten to enter into

<P>that union at once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I?' I said briefly; and I looked at his features,

<P>beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still

<P>severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright

<P>and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure;

<P>and fancied myself in idea his wife. Oh! it would never do! As his

<P>curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him

<P>in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him

<P>in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and

<P>vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at

<P>his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:

<P>profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should

<P>suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body

<P>would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would
be

<P>free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural

<P>unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of

<P>loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which would be only

<P>mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and

<P>sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured

<P>warrior-march trample down: but as his wife- at his side always, and

<P>always restrained, and always checked- forced to keep the fire of my

<P>nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never

<P>utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital-

<P>this would be unendurable.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John!' I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?' he answered icily.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your

<P>fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become

<P>part of you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A part of me you must become,' he answered steadily: 'otherwise

<P>the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out

<P>with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?

<P>How can we be for ever together- sometimes in solitudes, sometimes

<P>amidst savage tribes- and unwed?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well,' I said shortly; 'under the circumstances,
quite as

<P>well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman

<P>like yourself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce
you

<P>as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us

<P>both. And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you

<P>have a woman's heart and- it would not do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would do,' I affirmed with some disdain, 'perfectly
well. I

<P>have a woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I

<P>have only a comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness,

<P>fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission

<P>to his hierophant: nothing more- don't fear.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is what I want,' he said, speaking to himself; 'it
is just what

<P>I want. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.

<P>Jane, you would not repent marrying me- be certain of that; we must
be

<P>married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough
of

<P>love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your

<P>eyes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I scorn your idea of love,' I could not help saying, as
I rose

<P>up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. 'I scorn

<P>the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you

<P>when you offer it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips
while he did

<P>so. Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy

<P>to tell: he could command his countenance thoroughly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,'
he said: 'I

<P>think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high,
calm

<P>mien.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault
that I

<P>have been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a

<P>topic on which our natures are at variance- a topic we should never

<P>discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If

<P>the reality were required, what should we do? How should we feel? My

<P>dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage- forget it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' said he; 'it is a long-cherished scheme, and the
only one

<P>which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at

<P>present. To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends

<P>there to whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a

<P>fortnight- take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not

<P>forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God.

<P>Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only

<P>can you enter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself

<P>for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest

<P>in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the

<P>faith, and are worse than infidels!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had done. Turning from me, he once more
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'Looked to river, looked to hill.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not

<P>worthy to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I

<P>read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me: the

<P>disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met

<P>resistance where it expected submission- the disapprobation of a cool,

<P>inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and

<P>views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he

<P>would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a

<P>sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed

<P>so long a space for reflection and repentance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought
proper to

<P>forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I-

<P>who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him- was hurt by

<P>the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,' said
Diana,

<P>'during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering

<P>in the passage expecting you- he will make it up.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would
always

<P>rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him- he stood at the

<P>foot of the stairs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, St. John,' said I.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, Jane,' he replied calmly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then shake hands,' I added.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What a cold, loose touch he impressed on my fingers! He
was

<P>deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would

<P>not warm, nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had

<P>with him- no cheering smile or generous word: but still the

<P>Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave

<P>me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the

<P>remembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having

<P>been offended.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that answer he left me. I would much rather he
had knocked

<P>me down.
