<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. ROCHESTER did, on a future occasion, explain it. It
was one

<P>afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and

<P>while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk

<P>up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer,

<P>Celine Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a

<P>'grande passion.' This passion Celine had professed to return with

<P>even superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was:

<P>he believed, as he said, that she preferred his 'taille d'athlete'

<P>to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference
of

<P>the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an

<P>hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage,

<P>cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, etc. In short, I began the process

<P>of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I

<P>had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame

<P>and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not

<P>to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had- as I deserved to

<P>have- the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening

<P>when Celine did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm

<P>night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down

<P>in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by

<P>her presence. No,- I exaggerate; I never thought there was any

<P>consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille

<P>perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of

<P>sanctity. I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of

<P>conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself

<P>to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight

<P>and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The balcony was

<P>furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,- I

<P>will take one now, if you will excuse me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting
of a

<P>cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah

<P>incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was

<P>croquant- (overlook the barbarism)- croquant chocolate comfits, and

<P>smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along

<P>the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when

<P>in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English

<P>horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I

<P>recognised the "voiture" I had given Celine. She was returning: of

<P>course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant

<P>upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my

<P>flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted:

<P>though muffled in a cloak- an unnecessary encumbrance, by the bye,

<P>on so warm a June evening- I knew her instantly by her little foot,

<P>seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the

<P>carriage step. Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur "Mon

<P>ange"- in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of

<P>love alone- when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;

<P>cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the

<P>pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched

<P>porte cochere of the hotel.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course
not: I need

<P>not ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet

<P>to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which

<P>shall waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as

<P>that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with

<P>closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling

<P>not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at

<P>their base. But I tell you- and you may mark my words- you will come

<P>some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's

<P>stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either

<P>you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne

<P>on by some master-wave into a calmer current- as I am now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the
sterness and

<P>stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its

<P>antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its

<P>grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin:

<P>and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it

<P>like a great plague-house? How I do still abhor-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step
and struck

<P>his boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have

<P>him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall
was

<P>before us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a

<P>glare such as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire,

<P>impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a

<P>quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.

<P>Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling

<P>rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and

<P>resolute: it settled his passion and petrified his countenance: he

<P>went on-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging
a point

<P>with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk- a hag like

<P>one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. "You like

<P>Thornfield?" she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the

<P>air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the

<P>house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, "Like it if

<P>you can? Like it if you dare!"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"I will like it" said I; "I dare like it;" and' (he subjoined

<P>moodily) 'I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness,
to

<P>goodness- yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been,

<P>than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the

<P>habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will

<P>esteem but straw and rotten wood.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock. 'Away!'
he cried

<P>harshly; 'keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!' Continuing

<P>then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the

<P>point whence he had abruptly diverged-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you leave the balcony, sir,' I asked, 'when Mdlle.
Varens

<P>entered?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question,

<P>but, on the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he

<P>turned his eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his

<P>brow. 'Oh, I had forgotten Celine! Well, to resume. When I saw my

<P>charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a

<P>hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from

<P>the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in

<P>two minutes to my heart's core. Strange!' he exclaimed, suddenly

<P>starting again from the point. 'Strange that I should choose you for

<P>the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should

<P>listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the

<P>world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a

<P>quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last singularity explains

<P>the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity,

<P>considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.

<P>Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication

<P>with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a

<P>peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it:

<P>but, if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I

<P>converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh

<P>me.' After this digression he proceeded-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I remained in the balcony. "They will come to her boudoir,
no

<P>doubt," thought I: "Let me prepare an ambush." So putting my hand in

<P>through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an

<P>opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the

<P>casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to

<P>lovers' whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I

<P>resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture.

<P>Celine's chambermaid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and

<P>withdrew. The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed

<P>their cloaks, and there was "the Varens," shining in satin and

<P>jewels,- my gifts of course,- and there was her companion in an

<P>officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte- a

<P>brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and

<P>had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On

<P>recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly

<P>broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an

<P>extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not

<P>worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than

<P>I, who had been her dupe.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely:

<P>frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather

<P>calculated to weary than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on

<P>the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion.

<P>Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but

<P>they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way:

<P>especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal

<P>defects- deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to

<P>launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my "beaute

<P>male": wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me

<P>point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me

<P>handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele here came running up again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has
called and

<P>wishes to see you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I
walked in

<P>upon them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to

<P>vacate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies;

<P>disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions;

<P>made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de

<P>Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left

<P>a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a

<P>chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.

<P>But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette

<P>Adele, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be,

<P>though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her

<P>countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had

<P>broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy

<P>with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no natural claim on

<P>Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any,

<P>for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I

<P>e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and

<P>transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an

<P>English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now

<P>you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl,

<P>you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will

<P>be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another

<P>place- that you beg me to look out for a new governess, etc.- Eh?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults
or

<P>yours: I have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a

<P>sense, parentless- forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir-

<P>I shall cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer

<P>the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as

<P>a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a

<P>friend?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must
go in

<P>now; and you too: it darkens.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot-
ran a

<P>race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When

<P>we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my

<P>knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked:

<P>not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she

<P>was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a

<P>superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother,

<P>hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I

<P>was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I

<P>sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester,

<P>but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced

<P>relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to

<P>resemble him, he would have thought more of her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber
for the

<P>night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.
As

<P>he had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the

<P>substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion

<P>for a French dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day

<P>matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something

<P>decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized

<P>him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of

<P>his mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its

<P>environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually

<P>quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to

<P>the consideration of my master's manner to myself. The confidence he

<P>had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I

<P>regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for some

<P>weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed

<P>in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me

<P>unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and

<P>sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his

<P>presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me

<P>feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening

<P>conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him
talk with

<P>relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a

<P>mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I
do

<P>not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their

<P>interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange

<P>novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight
in

<P>receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he

<P>portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he

<P>disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint:
the

<P>friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me,

<P>drew me to him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather

<P>than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not

<P>mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become

<P>with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after

<P>kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of

<P>existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered

<P>flesh and strength.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader:
gratitude,

<P>and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the

<P>object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering

<P>than the brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed,
I

<P>could not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud,

<P>sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul

<P>I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity

<P>to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once,

<P>when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library

<P>alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked

<P>up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But

<P>I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults
of

<P>morality (I say former, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their

<P>source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a

<P>man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than

<P>such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny

<P>encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though

<P>for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I

<P>cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would

<P>have given much to assuage it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down
in bed, I

<P>could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,

<P>and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to

<P>be happy at Thornfield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why not?' I asked myself. 'What alienates him from the
house? Will

<P>he leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer

<P>than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight

<P>weeks. If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should
be

<P>absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine

<P>days will seem!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing;
at

<P>any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and

<P>lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had

<P>kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were

<P>depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my
inward

<P>tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck

<P>two. Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers

<P>had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery

<P>outside. I said, 'Who is there?' Nothing answered. I was chilled

<P>with fear.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when
the

<P>kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way

<P>up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying

<P>there myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.

<P>Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again

<P>through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But
it

<P>was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely

<P>approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a

<P>marrow-freezing incident enough.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a demoniac laugh- low, suppressed, and deep- uttered,
as

<P>it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my

<P>bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood

<P>at my bedside- or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked

<P>round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural

<P>sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My

<P>first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry

<P>out, 'Who is there?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated
up the

<P>gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been

<P>made to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was

<P>still.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?'

<P>thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to

<P>Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt

<P>and opened the door with a trembling hand. There was a candle

<P>burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery. I was

<P>surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to

<P>perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while

<P>looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue

<P>wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was
Mr.

<P>Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought
no

<P>more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the

<P>laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame

<P>darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze

<P>and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wake! wake!' I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured
and

<P>turned: the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the

<P>very sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer;

<P>fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled

<P>with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew

<P>back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch

<P>afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which

<P>were devouring it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher
which I

<P>flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash

<P>of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at

<P>last. Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him

<P>fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of

<P>water.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there a flood?' he cried.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir,' I answered; 'but there has been a fire: get up,
do; you

<P>are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane
Eyre?'

<P>he demanded. 'What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is

<P>in the room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name,
get up.

<P>Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and

<P>what it is.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle
yet: wait

<P>two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be-

<P>yes, here is my dressing-gown. Now run!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in
the

<P>gallery. He took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed,

<P>all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round

<P>swimming in water.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is it? and who did it?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange
laugh I

<P>had heard in the gallery; the step ascending to the third storey;

<P>the smoke,- the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in

<P>what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with

<P>all the water I could lay hands on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed
more

<P>concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had

<P>concluded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for?
What

<P>can she do? Let her sleep unmolested.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you
are not

<P>warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and

<P>sit down in the arm-chair: there,- I will put it on. Now place your

<P>feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave

<P>you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are

<P>till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the

<P>second storey. Don't move, remember, or call any one.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the
gallery

<P>very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as

<P>possible, shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left

<P>in total darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A

<P>very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the

<P>cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to

<P>rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's

<P>displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed

<P>dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the

<P>matting. 'I hope it is he,' thought I, 'and not something worse.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. 'I have found it all
out,'

<P>said he, setting his candle down on the washstand; 'it is as I

<P>thought.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking
on the

<P>ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar

<P>tone-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened
your

<P>chamber door.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh
before, I

<P>should think, or something like it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace
Poole,- she

<P>laughs in that way. She is a singular person.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just so. Grace Poole- you have guessed it. She is, as
you say,

<P>singular- very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am

<P>glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the

<P>precise details of to-night's incident. You are no talking fool: say

<P>nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs'

<P>(pointing to the bed): 'and now return to your own room. I shall do

<P>very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It

<P>is near four:- in two hours the servants will be up.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, then, sir,' said I, departing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He seemed surprised- very inconsistently so, as he had
just told me

<P>to go.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What!' he exclaimed, 'are you quitting me already, and
in that

<P>way?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said I might go, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But not without taking leave; not without a word or two
of

<P>acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry

<P>fashion. Why, you have saved my life!- snatched me from a horrible and

<P>excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual

<P>strangers! At least shake hands.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first
in one,

<P>then in both his own.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you
so

<P>immense a debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would

<P>have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an

<P>obligation: but you: it is different;- I feel your benefits no burden,

<P>Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on
his lips,-

<P>but his voice was checked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden,

<P>obligation, in the case.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I knew,' he continued, you would do me good in some way,
at some

<P>time;- I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression

<P>and smile did not'- (again he stopped)- 'did not' (he proceeded

<P>hastily) 'strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.

<P>People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there

<P>are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver,

<P>good-night!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am glad I happened to be awake,' I said: and then I
was going.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! you will go?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am cold, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cold? Yes,- and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!'
But he

<P>still retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself
of

<P>an expedient.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,' said I.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, leave me': he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning

<P>dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of

<P>trouble rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond

<P>its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and

<P>then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly

<P>towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy- a

<P>counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.

<P>Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish

<P>to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
