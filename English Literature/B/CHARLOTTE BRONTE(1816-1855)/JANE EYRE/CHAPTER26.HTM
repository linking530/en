<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; SOPHIE came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed
in

<P>accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I

<P>suppose, impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She

<P>was just fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to
my

<P>hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Stop!' she cried in French. 'Look at yourself in the mirror:
you

<P>have not taken one peep.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure,
so unlike

<P>my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. 'Jane!'

<P>called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the

<P>stairs by Mr. Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Lingerer!' he said, 'my brain is on fire with impatience,
and

<P>you tarry so long!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all
over,

<P>pronounced me 'fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but

<P>the desire of his eyes,' and then telling me he would give me but

<P>ten minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately

<P>hired servants, a footman, answered it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is John getting the carriage ready?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is the luggage brought down?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are bringing it down, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman)
and the

<P>clerk are there: return and tell me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the
gates; the

<P>footman soon returned.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the carriage?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The horses are harnessing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready
the

<P>moment we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped

<P>on, and the coachman in his seat.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, are you ready?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives
to

<P>wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax

<P>stood in the hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but

<P>my hand was held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride
I

<P>could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel

<P>that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I

<P>wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did- so bent up to a

<P>purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows,

<P>ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending
the

<P>drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes;

<P>and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. I wanted to see

<P>the invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to

<P>fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose

<P>force he seemed breasting and resisting.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was
quite

<P>out of breath. 'Am I cruel in my love?' he said. 'Delay an instant:

<P>lean on me, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house
of God

<P>rising calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a

<P>ruddy morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green

<P>grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of

<P>strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the

<P>mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them,

<P>because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of the

<P>church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle

<P>door and witness the ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not

<P>observed; he was earnestly looking at my face, from which the blood

<P>had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and

<P>my cheeks and lips cold. When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked

<P>gently with me up the path to the porch.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited
in his

<P>white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was

<P>still: two shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had

<P>been correct: the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now

<P>stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs towards us,

<P>viewing through the rails the old times-stained marble tomb, where a

<P>kneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at

<P>Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his

<P>wife.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious
step

<P>behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers- a

<P>gentleman, evidently- was advancing up the chancel. The service began.

<P>The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and

<P>then the clergyman came a step farther forward, and, bending

<P>slightly towards Mr. Rochester, went on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the
dreadful

<P>day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed),

<P>that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be

<P>joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well

<P>assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word

<P>doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony

<P>lawful.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that

<P>sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred

<P>years. And the clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book,

<P>and had held his breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was

<P>already stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to

<P>ask, 'Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?-' when a distinct

<P>and near voice said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of
an

<P>impediment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute;
the clerk

<P>did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had

<P>rolled under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his

<P>head or eyes, he said, 'Proceed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with
deep

<P>but low intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot proceed without some investigation into what
has been

<P>asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The ceremony is quite broken off,' subjoined the voice
behind

<P>us. 'I am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable

<P>impediment to this marriage exists.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn
and rigid,

<P>making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and

<P>strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale,

<P>firm, massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful,

<P>and yet wild beneath!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. 'What is the nature of the

<P>impediment?' he asked. 'Perhaps it may be got over- explained away?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hardly,' was the answer. 'I have called it insuperable,
and I

<P>speak advisedly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,

<P>uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.
Mr.

<P>Rochester has a wife now living.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had
never

<P>vibrated to thunder- my blood felt their subtle violence as it had

<P>never felt frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of

<P>swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His

<P>whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He

<P>disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without

<P>speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a

<P>human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to

<P>his side.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who are you?' he asked of the intruder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you would thrust on me a wife?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which
the law

<P>recognises, if you do not.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Favour me with an account of her- with her name, her parentage,

<P>her place of abode.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly.' Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket,
and

<P>read out in a sort of official, nasal voice:-

<P>date of fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield

<P>England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter

<P>of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at-

<P>church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage will be

<P>found in the register of that church- a copy of it is now in my

<P>possession. Signed, Richard Mason."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That- if a genuine document- may prove I have been married,
but it

<P>does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still

<P>living.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was living three months ago,' returned the lawyer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you know?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you,
sir,

<P>will scarcely controvert.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Produce him- or go to hell.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will produce him first- he is on the spot. Mr. Mason,
have the

<P>goodness to step forward.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he

<P>experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as
I

<P>was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through

<P>his frame. The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the

<P>background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the solicitor's

<P>shoulder- yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared

<P>at him. His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a

<P>tawny, nay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face flushed- olive

<P>cheek and hueless forehead received a glow as from spreading,

<P>ascending heart-fire: and he stirred, lifted his strong arm- he

<P>could have struck Mason, dashed him on the church-floor, shocked by

<P>ruthless blow the breath from his body- but Mason shrank away and

<P>cried faintly, 'Good God!' Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester- his

<P>passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only asked- 'What

<P>have you to say?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I
again

<P>demand, what have you to say?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir- sir,' interrupted the clergyman, 'do not forget you
are in

<P>a sacred place.' Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, 'Are you

<P>aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Courage,' urged the lawyer,- 'speak out.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is now living at Thornfield Hall,' said Mason, in
more

<P>articulate tones: 'I saw her there last April. I am her brother.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At Thornfield Hall!' ejaculated the clergyman. 'Impossible!
I am

<P>an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a

<P>Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he
muttered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it- or
of her

<P>under that name.' He mused- for ten minutes he held counsel with

<P>himself: he formed his resolve, and announced it-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from
the

<P>barrel. Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green

<P>(to the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.'

<P>The man obeyed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: 'Bigamy
is an ugly

<P>word!- I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred

<P>me, or Providence has checked me,- perhaps the last. I am little

<P>better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell

<P>me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the

<P>quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken

<P>up:- what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married,

<P>and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard

<P>of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you

<P>have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious

<P>lunatic kept there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you

<P>that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I

<P>now inform you that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,-

<P>Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now,

<P>with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout

<P>heart men may bear. Cheer up, Dick!- never fear me!- I'd almost as

<P>soon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad

<P>family; idiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother,

<P>the Creole, was both a mad-woman and a drunkard!- as I found out after

<P>I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before.

<P>Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points. I

<P>had a charming partner- pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a

<P>happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been

<P>heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation.

<P>Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and

<P>visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and my wife! You shall see what sort of

<P>a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had
a

<P>right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at

<P>least human. This girl,' he continued, looking at me, 'knew no more

<P>than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and

<P>legal, and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned

<P>union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and

<P>embruted partner! Come all of you- follow!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen
came

<P>after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take it back to the coach-house, John,' said Mr. Rochester
coolly:

<P>'it will not be wanted to-day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced
to

<P>meet and greet us.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To the right-about- every soul!' cried the master; 'away
with your

<P>congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!- they are fifteen years too

<P>late!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my
hand, and

<P>still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We

<P>mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the

<P>third storey: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's

<P>master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and

<P>its pictorial cabinet.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know this place, Mason,' said our guide; 'she bit
and

<P>stabbed you here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second
door:

<P>this, too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire

<P>guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the

<P>ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking

<P>something in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of

<P>the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether

<P>beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it

<P>grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like

<P>some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a

<P>quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and

<P>face.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!' said Mr. Rochester. 'How are
you? and

<P>how is your charge to-day?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We're tolerable, sir, I thank you,' replied Grace, lifting
the

<P>boiling mess carefully on to the hob: 'rather snappish, but not

<P>'rageous.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report:
the

<P>clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! sir, she sees you!' exclaimed Grace: 'you'd better
not stay.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take care then, sir!- for God's sake, take care!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her
visage,

<P>and gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,-

<P>those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Keep out of the way,' said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her
aside:

<P>'she has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning:
it is not in

<P>mortal discretion to fathom her craft.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We had better leave her,' whispered Mason.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go to the devil!' was his brother-in-law's recommendation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Ware!' cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.

<P>Mr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his

<P>throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She

<P>was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and

<P>corpulent besides: she showed virile force in the contest- more than

<P>once she almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have

<P>settled her with a well-planted blow: but he would not strike: he

<P>would only wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him

<P>a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was

<P>at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst

<P>the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then

<P>turned to the spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid

<P>and desolate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is my wife,' said he. 'Such is the sole conjugal
embrace I am

<P>ever to know- such are the endearments which are to solace my

<P>leisure hours! And this is what I wished to have' (laying his hand

<P>on my shoulder): 'this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at

<P>the mouth of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon. I

<P>wanted her just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs,

<P>look at the difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls

<P>yonder- this face with that mask- this form with that bulk; then judge

<P>me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what

<P>judgment ye judge ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut
up

<P>my prize.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us,
to give

<P>some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he

<P>descended the stair.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You, madam,' said he, 'are cleared from all blame: your
uncle will

<P>be glad to hear it- if, indeed, he should be still living- when Mr.

<P>Mason returns to Madeira.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent
of his

<P>house for some years. When your uncle received your letter

<P>intimating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr.

<P>Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his

<P>health, on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr.

<P>Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was

<P>acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason,

<P>astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real

<P>state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick-bed;

<P>from which, considering the nature of his disease- decline- and the

<P>stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise. He could not

<P>then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into

<P>which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in

<P>taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He referred him to me

<P>for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too

<P>late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally certain that

<P>your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to

<P>accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better

<P>remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr.

<P>Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?' he inquired of Mr. Mason.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no- let us be gone,' was the anxious reply; and without

<P>waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the

<P>hall door. The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either
of

<P>admonition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done,

<P>he too departed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own
room,

<P>to which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,

<P>fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded- not to weep,

<P>not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but- mechanically to take

<P>off the wedding-dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn

<P>yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt

<P>weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on

<P>them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved-

<P>followed up and down where I was led or dragged- watched event rush
on

<P>event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning had been a quiet morning enough- all except
the brief

<P>scene with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been

<P>noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no

<P>dispute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words

<P>had been spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made;

<P>some stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers,

<P>explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of the truth

<P>had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen;

<P>the intruders were gone, and all was over.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in my own room as usual- just myself, without obvious
change:

<P>nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was

<P>the Jane Eyre of yesterday?- where was her life?- where were her

<P>prospects?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman- almost
a bride,

<P>was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were

<P>desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December

<P>storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts

<P>crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen

<P>shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were

<P>pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours

<P>since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now

<P>spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My

<P>hopes were all dead- struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night,

<P>fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my

<P>cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark,

<P>chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at my love:

<P>that feeling which was my master's- which he had created; it

<P>shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle;

<P>sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr.

<P>Rochester's arms- it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh,

<P>never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted- confidence

<P>destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was

<P>not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I would

<P>not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was

<P>gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I

<P>perceived well. When- how- whither, I could not yet discern; but he

<P>himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real

<P>affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only

<P>fitful passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should

<P>fear even to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh,

<P>how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed
to swim

<P>round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.

<P>Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down

<P>in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in

<P>remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will,
to

<P>flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only

<P>still throbbed life-like within me- a remembrance of God: it begot

<P>an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my

<P>rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was

<P>found to express them-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none
to help.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven
to avert it-

<P>as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my

<P>lips- it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The

<P>whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched,

<P>my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen

<P>mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, 'the waters came

<P>into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing: I came into

<P>deep waters; the floods overflowed me.'
