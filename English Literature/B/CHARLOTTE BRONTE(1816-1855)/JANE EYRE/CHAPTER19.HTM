<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and
the

<P>Sibyl- if Sibyl she were- was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair
at

<P>the chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or

<P>rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped

<P>handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the

<P>table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little

<P>black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she

<P>muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she read;

<P>she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she

<P>wished to finish a paragraph.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather
cold with

<P>sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as

<P>composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the

<P>gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm. She shut her book and slowly

<P>looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see,
as

<P>she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and

<P>black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed

<P>under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye

<P>confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, and you want your fortune told?' she said, in a
voice as

<P>decided as her glance, as harsh as her features.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself:
but I

<P>ought to warn you, I have no faith.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you;
I

<P>heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you? You've a quick ear.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need them all in your trade.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal
with. Why

<P>don't you tremble?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm not cold.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why don't you turn pale?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not sick.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why don't you consult my art?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm not silly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The old crone 'nichered' a laugh under her bonnet and bandage;

<P>she then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to

<P>smoke. Having indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent

<P>body, took the pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the

<P>fire, said very deliberately-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Prove it,' I rejoined.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone:
no

<P>contact strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick;

<P>because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to

<P>man, keeps far away from you. You are silly, because, suffer as you

<P>may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step
to

<P>meet it where it waits you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed
her

<P>smoking with vigour.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You might say all that to almost any one who you knew
lived as a

<P>solitary dependant in a great house.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true
of almost

<P>any one?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In my circumstances.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another
precisely

<P>placed as you are.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would be easy to find you thousands.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are
peculiarly

<P>situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The

<P>materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine

<P>them. Chance laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and

<P>bliss results.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle
in my

<P>life.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be sure.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot
which

<P>she took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned

<P>it, she told me to hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face
to

<P>the palm, and pored over it without touching it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is too fine,' said she. 'I can make nothing of such
a hand as

<P>that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not

<P>written there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you,' said I.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' she continued, 'it is in the face: on the forehead,
about the

<P>eyes, in the eyes themselves, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and

<P>lift up your head.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! now you are coming to reality,' I said, as I obeyed
her. 'I

<P>shall begin to put some faith in you presently.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire,
so that

<P>a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however,

<P>as she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it

<P>illumined.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,'
she said,

<P>when she had examined me a while. 'I wonder what thoughts are busy

<P>in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the

<P>fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just

<P>as little sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if

<P>they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual

<P>substance.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please
you

<P>with whispers of the future?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out
of my

<P>earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by

<P>myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting
in that

<P>window-seat (you see I know your habits)-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have learned them from the servants.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to
speak

<P>truth, I have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I started to my feet when I heard the name.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have- have you?' thought I; 'there is diablerie in
the

<P>business after all, then!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't be alarmed,' continued the strange being; 'she's
a safe hand

<P>&nbsp;is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence
in her.

<P>But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of

<P>nothing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any
of

<P>the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not

<P>one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at

<P>least curiosity?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But do you never single one from the rest-or it may be,
two?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair
seem telling

<P>a tale: it amuses me to watch them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What tale do you like best to hear?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the
same

<P>theme- courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe-

<P>marriage.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And do you like that monotonous theme?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and
health,

<P>charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,

<P>sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I what?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know- and perhaps think well of.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged
a

<P>syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider

<P>some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,

<P>dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty

<P>to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling

<P>disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged
a

<P>syllable with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the

<P>house!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is not at home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to
Millcote

<P>this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that

<P>circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance- blot him,

<P>as it were, out of existence?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do
with the

<P>theme you had introduced.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen;
and of

<P>late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they

<P>overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never

<P>remarked that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his
guests.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No question about his right: but have you never observed
that,

<P>of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been

<P>favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.'

<P>I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk,

<P>voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One

<P>unexpected sentence came from her lips after another, till I got

<P>involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit

<P>had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings and

<P>taking record of every pulse.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eagerness of a listener!' repeated she: 'yes; Mr. Rochester
has

<P>sat by the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took

<P>such delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was

<P>so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given

<P>him; you have noticed this?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his
face.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect,
if

<P>not gratitude?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said nothing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have seen love: have you not?- and, looking forward,
you

<P>have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph! Not exactly. Your witch's skill is rather at fault

<P>sometimes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What the devil have you seen, then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is
it known

<P>that Mr. Rochester is to be married?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shortly?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt

<P>(though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem

<P>to question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love

<P>such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she

<P>loves him, or, if not his person, at least his purse. I know she

<P>considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though

<P>(God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an hour

<P>ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth

<P>fell half an inch. I would advise her black-aviced suitor to look out:

<P>if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,- he's dished-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune:
I

<P>came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face,
one trait

<P>contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness:

<P>that I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid

<P>it carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on

<P>yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you

<P>will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed,
leaning back

<P>in her chair. She began muttering,-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew;
it looks

<P>soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon; it is susceptible;

<P>impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it

<P>ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the

<P>lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns

<P>from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a

<P>mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,-

<P>to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and

<P>reserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it
is

<P>disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it

<P>would be silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible,
it

<P>was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of

<P>solitude; it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and

<P>have human affection for its interlocutor. That feature too is

<P>propitious.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and
that brow

<P>professes to say,- "I can live alone, if self-respect and

<P>circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy

<P>bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive

<P>if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a

<P>price I cannot afford to give." The forehead declares, "Reason sits

<P>firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away

<P>and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like

<P>true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of

<P>vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every

<P>argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind,

<P>earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding

<P>of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of

<P>conscience."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.
I have

<P>formed my plans- right plans I deem them- and in them I have

<P>attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know

<P>how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss

<P>offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were

<P>detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution- such is

<P>not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight- to earn gratitude,

<P>not to wring tears of blood- no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in

<P>smiles, in endearments, in sweet- That will do. I think I rave in a

<P>kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this

<P>moment ad infinitum; but I dare not. So far I have governed myself

<P>thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but

<P>further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me;

<P>"the play is played out."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming?
Did I

<P>dream still? The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her

<P>gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass- as the

<P>speech of my own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred

<P>the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her

<P>bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The

<P>flame illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert

<P>for discoveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the

<P>withered limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with

<P>smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the

<P>little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I

<P>had seen a hundred times before. Again I looked at the face; which was

<P>no longer turned from me- on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed,

<P>the bandage displaced, the head advanced.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane, do you know me?' asked the familiar voice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But the string is in a knot- help me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Break it, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, then- "Off, ye lendings!"' And Mr. Rochester stepped
out of

<P>his disguise.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, sir, what a strange idea!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But well carried out, eh? Don't you think so?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With the ladies you must have managed well.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But not with you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What character did I act? My own?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have
been

<P>trying to draw me out- or in; you have been talking nonsense to make

<P>me talk nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you forgive me, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on

<P>reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall

<P>try to forgive you; but it was not right.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, you have been very correct- very careful, very sensible.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a
comfort;

<P>but, indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the

<P>interview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and

<P>fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman

<P>had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her

<P>anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace

<P>Poole- that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I

<P>considered her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' said he, 'what are you musing about? What does
that grave

<P>smile signify?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission
to

<P>retire now, I suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the
drawing-room

<P>yonder are doing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit down!- Let me hear what they said about me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven
o'clock.

<P>Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here

<P>since you left this morning?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A stranger!- no; who can it be? I expected no one; is
he gone?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take
the

<P>liberty of installing himself here till you returned.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The devil he did! Did he give his name?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies;
from

<P>Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand,
as if

<P>to lead me to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive

<P>grip; the smile on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his

<P>breath.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mason!- the West Indies!' he said, in the tone one might
fancy a

<P>speaking automaton to enounce its single words; 'Mason!- the West

<P>Indies!' he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,

<P>growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly

<P>seemed to know what he was doing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you feel ill, sir?' I inquired.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!' He staggered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, lean on me, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me
have it

<P>now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand
in both

<P>his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most

<P>troubled and dreary look.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My little friend!' said he, 'I wish I were in a quiet
island

<P>with only you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections

<P>removed from me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can I help you, sir?- I'd give my life to serve you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I
promise

<P>you that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,- I'll try, at least,
to do

<P>it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room:
they

<P>will be at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what

<P>he is doing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper,
as

<P>Mr. Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,- the supper was

<P>arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they

<P>stood about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in

<P>their hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and

<P>conversation were general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire,

<P>talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of

<P>them. I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly

<P>as I did so: she thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I

<P>returned to the library.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he
looked

<P>once more firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!' he said. He

<P>swallowed the contents and returned it to me. 'What are they doing,

<P>Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Laughing and talking, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard

<P>something strange?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Mason?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He was laughing too.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what
would

<P>you do, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He half smiled. 'But if I were to go to them, and they
only

<P>looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other,

<P>and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go

<P>with them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in
staying

<P>with you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To comfort me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and
if I did,

<P>I should care nothing about it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, you could dare censure for my sake?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved
my

<P>adherence; as you, I am sure, do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and
whisper

<P>in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show

<P>him in here and then leave me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed
straight

<P>among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded

<P>him from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went

<P>upstairs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard
the

<P>visitors repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's

<P>voice, and heard him say, 'This way, Mason; this is your room.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.
I was soon

<P>asleep.
