<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; BUT the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood
lessened.

<P>Spring drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter

<P>had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My

<P>wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of

<P>January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of

<P>April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature

<P>froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour

<P>passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be

<P>pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds,

<P>which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed

<P>them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps.

<P>Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snowdrops, crocuses, purple

<P>auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons

<P>(half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers

<P>opening by the wayside, under the hedges.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment
which the

<P>horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls

<P>of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits

<P>girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a

<P>bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different

<P>had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky

<P>of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!- when mists as

<P>chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those

<P>purple peaks, and rolled down 'ing' and holm till they blended with

<P>the frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent,

<P>turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound

<P>through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and

<P>for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; April advanced to May: a bright, serene May it was; days
of blue

<P>sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its

<P>duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose

<P>its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and

<P>oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang

<P>up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled

<P>its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth

<P>of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in

<P>overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this
I

<P>enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this

<P>unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now

<P>becomes my task to advert.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when
I speak

<P>of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a

<P>stream? Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is

<P>another question.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog
and

<P>fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring,

<P>crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded

<P>schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the

<P>seminary into an hospital.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most
of the

<P>pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay

<P>ill at one time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who

<P>continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the

<P>medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to

<P>keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure

<P>to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple's whole attention was

<P>absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting

<P>it except to snatch a few hours' rest at night. The teachers were

<P>fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations

<P>for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have

<P>friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat
of

<P>contagion. Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died

<P>at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of

<P>the malady forbidding delay.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood,
and death

<P>its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;

<P>while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug

<P>and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of

<P>mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and

<P>beautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers:

<P>hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips

<P>and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay

<P>with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out,

<P>morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these

<P>fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood,

<P>except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to

<P>put in a coffin.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the

<P>beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like

<P>gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where

<P>we liked: we lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never

<P>came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the

<P>cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection;

<P>her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused
to

<P>the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.

<P>Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our

<P>breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare

<P>a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large

<P>piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we

<P>carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we

<P>liked best, and dined sumptuously.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising
white and

<P>dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by

<P>wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone

<P>was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and

<P>me, at that time my chosen comrade- one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd,

<P>observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly

<P>because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a

<P>manner which set me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more

<P>of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with

<P>her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample

<P>indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had

<P>a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to

<P>question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much

<P>entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend
these

<P>sweet days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so

<P>worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the

<P>Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first

<P>acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and

<P>reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in;

<P>while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give

<P>those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far

<P>higher things.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am
a defective

<P>being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired
of

<P>Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of

<P>attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever

<P>animated my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times

<P>and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful

<P>friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never

<P>troubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been

<P>removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not,
I

<P>was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever

<P>patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by

<P>consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which

<P>time and care would be sure to alleviate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or
twice

<P>coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by

<P>Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not

<P>allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom

<P>window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and

<P>sat at a distance under the verandah.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out
very late

<P>with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves

<P>from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way,

<P>and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived,

<P>who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the

<P>wood. When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew

<P>to be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann

<P>remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had

<P>been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house;

<P>I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots

<P>I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I

<P>left them till the morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer:

<P>the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant

<P>evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly

<P>another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the

<P>grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child

<P>might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger
of

<P>dying! This world is pleasant- it would be dreary to be called from

<P>it, and to have to go who knows where?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend
what

<P>had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first

<P>time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind,

<P>on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it

<P>felt the one point where it stood- the present; all the rest was

<P>formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of

<P>tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new

<P>idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him

<P>was a nurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she

<P>was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How is Helen Burns?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very poorly,' was the answer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what does he say about her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He says she'll not be here long.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have
only

<P>conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to

<P>Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it

<P>meant she was dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my

<P>comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this

<P>world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits,
if

<P>such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong

<P>thrill of grief, then a desire- a necessity to see her; and I asked
in

<P>what room she lay.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is in Miss Temple's room,' said the nurse.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May I go up and speak to her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for
you to come

<P>in; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side
entrance

<P>which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine

<P>o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when
I- not

<P>having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence

<P>of the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound

<P>repose- rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without

<P>shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's

<P>room. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way;

<P>and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there
at

<P>passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour
of

<P>camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room:

<P>and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all

<P>night should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for

<P>I must see Helen,- I must embrace her before she died,- I must give

<P>her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the
house

<P>below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two

<P>doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then

<P>just opposite to me was Miss Temple's room. A light shone through

<P>the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the

<P>vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to

<P>admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to

<P>hesitate, and full of impatient impulses- soul and senses quivering

<P>with keen throes- I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen,

<P>and feared to find death.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white

<P>curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under

<P>the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had

<P>spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed

<P>candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I

<P>knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the

<P>fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on

<P>the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still

<P>recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen!' I whispered softly, 'are you awake?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her
face,

<P>pale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that
my

<P>fear was instantly dissipated.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can it be you, Jane?' she asked, in her own gentle voice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh!' I thought, 'she is not going to die; they are mistaken:
she

<P>could not speak and look so calmly if she were.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold,
and her

<P>cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she

<P>smiled as of old.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock:
I heard it

<P>strike some minutes since.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and
I could

<P>not sleep till I had spoken to you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time
probably.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; to my long home- my last home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no, Helen!' I stopped, distressed. While I tried to
devour

<P>my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake

<P>the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then

<P>she whispered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself

<P>with my quilt.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close
to her.

<P>After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead,
you

<P>must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We

<P>all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not

<P>painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no

<P>one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married,

<P>and will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.

<P>I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the

<P>world: I should have been continually at fault.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you
know?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is God? What is God?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.
I rely

<P>implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count

<P>the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to

<P>Him, reveal Him to me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place
as heaven,

<P>and that our souls can get to it when we die?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good;
I can

<P>resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my

<P>father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will come to the same region of happiness: be received
by

<P>the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. 'Where
is that

<P>region? Does it exist?' And I clasped my arms closer around Helen; she

<P>seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go;

<P>I lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the

<P>sweetest tone-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired
me a

<P>little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like

<P>to have you near me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you warm, darling?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, Helen.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me;
I looked

<P>up; I was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me

<P>through the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for

<P>leaving my bed; people had something else to think about; no

<P>explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two

<P>afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room
at

<P>dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen

<P>Burns's shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was-

<P>dead.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years
after

<P>her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble

<P>tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word

<P>'Resurgam.'
