<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE recollection of about three days and nights succeeding
this

<P>is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that

<P>interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew

<P>I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to

<P>have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me

<P>from it would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse

<P>of time- of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I

<P>observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell

<P>who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood

<P>near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs

<P>was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent

<P>visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me

<P>away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was

<P>prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once

<P>or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my

<P>bedside-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is very well we took her in.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door
in the

<P>morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone

<P>through?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Strange hardships, I imagine- poor, emaciated, pallid
wanderer?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her
manner

<P>of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took

<P>off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is,
I

<P>rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy

<P>her physiognomy would be agreeable.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of
regret at

<P>the hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or

<P>aversion to, myself. I was comforted.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my
state of

<P>lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted

<P>fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he

<P>was sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve

<P>had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep

<P>torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would
be

<P>rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few

<P>words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone
of

<P>a man little accustomed to expansive comment, 'Rather an unusual

<P>physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far otherwise,' responded Diana. 'To speak truth, St.
John, my

<P>heart rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to

<P>benefit her permanently.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is hardly likely,' was the reply. 'You will find
she is

<P>some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and

<P>has probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in

<P>restoring her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of

<P>force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability.' He

<P>stood considering me some minutes; then added, 'She looks sensible,

<P>but not at all handsome.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is so ill, St. John.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and
harmony of

<P>beauty are quite wanting in those features.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak,

<P>move, rise in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and

<P>dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with

<P>relish: the food was good- void of the feverish flavour which had

<P>hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt

<P>comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and

<P>desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; but what could I put

<P>on? Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the

<P>ground and fallen in the marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my

<P>benefactors so clad. I was spared the humiliation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean
and dry. My

<P>black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were

<P>removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was

<P>quite decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered

<P>presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb

<P>and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting

<P>every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung

<P>loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with

<P>a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking- no speck of the

<P>dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to

<P>degrade me, left- I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the

<P>banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to

<P>the kitchen.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth
of a

<P>generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are

<P>most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been

<P>loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds

<P>among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first:

<P>latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come
in

<P>tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, you have got up!' she said. 'You are better, then.
You may

<P>sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled
about,

<P>examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning
to

<P>me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger
was out of

<P>the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I

<P>answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar;
any

<P>more than yourself or your young ladies.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After a pause she said, 'I dunnut understand that: you've
like no

<P>house, nor no brass, I guess?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean
money)

<P>does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you book-learned?' she inquired presently.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, very.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you've never been to a boarding-school?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was at a boarding-school eight years.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened her eyes wide. 'Whatever cannot ye keep yourself
for,

<P>then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.
What

<P>are you going to do with these gooseberries?' I inquired as she

<P>brought out a basket of the fruit.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mak' 'em into pies.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give them to me and I'll pick them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I must do something. Let me have them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to
spread over

<P>my dress, 'lest,' as she said, 'I should mucky it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands,'
she

<P>remarked. 'Happen ye've been a dressmaker?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been:
don't

<P>trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the

<P>house where we are.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.
When he

<P>is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That village a few miles off?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what is he?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is a parson.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage,

<P>when I had asked to see the clergyman. 'This, then, was his father's

<P>residence?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather,

<P>and gurt (great) grandfather afore him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Their father is dead?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They have no mother?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The mistress has been dead this mony a year.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you lived with the family long?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I've lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That proves you must have been an honest and faithful
servant. I

<P>will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call

<P>me a beggar.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She again regarded me with a surprised stare. 'I believe,'
she

<P>said, 'I was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so

<P>mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And though,' I continued, rather severely, 'you wished
to turn

<P>me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more
o' th'

<P>childer nor of mysel: poor things! They've like nobody to tak' care
on

<P>'em but me. I'm like to look sharpish.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You munnut think too hardly of me,' she again remarked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I do think hardly of you,' I said; 'and I'll tell
you why- not

<P>so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an

<P>impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that
I

<P>had no "brass" and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived

<P>have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you

<P>ought not to consider poverty a crime.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No more I ought,' said she: 'Mr. St. John tells me so
too; and I

<P>see I wor wrang- but I've clear a different notion on you now to

<P>what I had. You look a raight down dacent little crater.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That will do- I forgive you now. Shake hands.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and
heartier

<P>smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the
fruit, and

<P>she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry

<P>details about her deceased master and mistress, and 'the childer,'

<P>as she called the young people.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a

<P>gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had

<P>belonged to the Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she

<P>affirmed, 'aboon two hundred year old- for all it looked but a

<P>small, humble place, naught to compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall

<P>down i' Morton Vale. But she could remember Bill Oliver's father a

<P>journeyman needle-maker; and th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days

<P>o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i'

<P>Morton Church vestry.' Still, she allowed, 'the owd maister was like

<P>other folk- naught mich out o' th' common way: stark mad o'

<P>shooting, and farming, and sich like.' The mistress was different. She

<P>was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the 'bairns' had taken

<P>after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had

<P>been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they

<P>could speak; and they had always been 'of a mak' of their own.' Mr.

<P>St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and

<P>the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as

<P>governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago

<P>lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt;

<P>and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must

<P>provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a

<P>long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of

<P>their father's death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and

<P>all these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many

<P>other grand towns; but they always said there was no place like

<P>home; and then they were so agreeable with each other- never fell

<P>out nor 'threaped.' She did not know where there was such a family for

<P>being united.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked
where the

<P>two ladies and their brother were now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back
in half

<P>an hour to tea.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them:
they

<P>entered by the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely

<P>bowed and passed through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few

<P>words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing

<P>me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: she

<P>shook her head at me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should have waited for my leave to descend,' she said.
'You

<P>still look very pale- and so thin! Poor child!- poor girl!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of
a dove.

<P>She possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face

<P>seemed to me full of charm. Mary's countenance was equally

<P>intelligent- her features equally pretty; but her expression was

<P>more reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana

<P>looked and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will,

<P>evidently. It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an

<P>authority supported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and

<P>self-respect permitted, to an active will.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what business have you here?' she continued. 'It is
not your

<P>place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we

<P>like to be free, even to license- but you are a visitor, and must go

<P>into the parlour.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very well here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you
with

<P>flour.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Besides, the fire is too hot for you,' interposed Mary.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be sure,' added her sister. 'Come, you must be obedient.'
And

<P>still holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner

<P>room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit there,' she said, placing me on the sofa, 'while we
take our

<P>things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we

<P>exercise in our little moorland home- to prepare our own meals when
we

<P>are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or

<P>ironing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John,
who sat

<P>opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first, the

<P>parlour, and then its occupant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished,
yet

<P>comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were

<P>very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few

<P>strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days

<P>decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained

<P>some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous

<P>ornament in the room- not one modern piece of furniture, save a

<P>brace of workboxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a

<P>side-table: everything- including the carpet and curtains- looked at

<P>once well worn and well saved.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. St. John- sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures
on

<P>the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips

<P>mutely sealed- was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue

<P>instead of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young- perhaps

<P>from twenty-eight to thirty- tall, slender; his face riveted the

<P>eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight,

<P>classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom,

<P>indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.

<P>He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my

<P>lineaments, his own being so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue,

<P>with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was

<P>partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he
whom it

<P>describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a

<P>yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as

<P>he now sat, there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his

<P>brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either

<P>restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even

<P>direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she

<P>passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little

<P>cake, baked on the top of the oven.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eat that now,' she said: 'you must be hungry. Hannah says
you have

<P>had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.
Mr.

<P>Rivers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a

<P>seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an

<P>unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his

<P>gaze now, which told that intention and not diffidence, had hitherto

<P>kept it averted from the stranger.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are very hungry,' he said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am, sir.' It is my way- it always was my way, by instinct-

<P>ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to
abstain

<P>for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to

<P>the cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though

<P>still not immoderately.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,' was
my very

<P>clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' he said coolly: 'when you have indicated to us the

<P>residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be

<P>restored to home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do;
being

<P>absolutely without home and friends.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there
was

<P>no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak

<P>particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes, though clear enough

<P>in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He

<P>seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's

<P>thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of

<P>keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass

<P>than to encourage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you mean to say,' he asked, 'that you are completely
isolated

<P>from every connection?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim
do I

<P>possess to admittance under any roof in England.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A most singular position at your age!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were
folded on

<P>the table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon

<P>explained the quest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have never been married? You are a spinster?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana laughed. 'Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen
years

<P>old, St. John,' said she.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and
agitating

<P>recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all

<P>saw the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by

<P>turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the

<P>colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he

<P>had excited forced out tears as well as colour.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where did you last reside?' he now asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are too inquisitive, St. John,' murmured Mary in a
low

<P>voice; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second

<P>firm and piercing look.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The name of the place where, and of the person with whom
I

<P>lived, is my secret,' I replied concisely.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to
keep, both

<P>from St. John and every other questioner,' remarked Diana.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot
help

<P>you,' he said. 'And you need help, do you not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true

<P>philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can

<P>do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the

<P>barest necessaries of life.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am
willing to

<P>aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then,

<P>tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you can do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by
the

<P>beverage; as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my

<P>unstrung nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young

<P>judge steadily.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rivers,' I said, turning to him, and looking at him,
as he

<P>looked at me, openly and without diffidence, 'you and your sisters

<P>have done me a great service- the greatest man can do his

<P>fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from

<P>death. This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my

<P>gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I

<P>will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have

<P>harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind-
my

<P>own security, moral and physical, and that of others.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents
died

<P>before I could know them. I was brought up a dependant; educated in

<P>a charitable institution. I will even tell you the name of the

<P>establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a

<P>Mr. Rivers?- the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the
school.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private
governess. I

<P>obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged

<P>to leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I

<P>cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and

<P>would sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from

<P>culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for
a

<P>time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a

<P>paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two

<P>points in planning my departure- speed, secrecy: to secure these, I

<P>had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel;

<P>which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the

<P>coach that brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I

<P>came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and

<P>wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in

<P>that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by

<P>hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr.

<P>Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under

<P>the shelter of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me

<P>since- for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor- and

<P>I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt

<P>as to your evangelical charity.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't make her talk any more now, St. John,' said Diana,
as I

<P>paused; 'she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa

<P>and sit down now, Miss Elliott.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias:
I had

<P>forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,

<P>noticed it at once.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said your name was Jane Elliott?' he observed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient

<P>to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear

<P>it, it sounds strange to me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your real name you will not give?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure

<P>would lead to it, I avoid.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are quite right, I am sure,' said Diana. 'Now do,
brother, let

<P>her be at peace a while.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced
as

<P>imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality-
you

<P>would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters'

<P>compassion, and, above all, with my charity (I am quite sensible of

<P>the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it- it is just): you desire

<P>to be independent of us?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or
how to

<P>seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to

<P>the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread

<P>another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed you shall stay here,' said Diana, putting her white
hand on

<P>my head. 'You shall,' repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative

<P>sincerity which seemed natural to her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,'
said Mr. St.

<P>John, 'as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a

<P>half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their

<P>casement. I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping

<P>yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is

<P>narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must

<P>be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day
of

<P>small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can

<P>offer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has already said that she is willing to do anything
honest she

<P>can do,' answered Diana for me; 'and you know, St. John, she has no

<P>choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people

<P>as you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I
will be a

<P>servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,' I answered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Right,' said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. 'If such is your

<P>spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied
before tea.

<P>I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my

<P>present strength would permit.
