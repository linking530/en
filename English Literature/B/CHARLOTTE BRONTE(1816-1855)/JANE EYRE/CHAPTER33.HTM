<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEN Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling

<P>storm continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh

<P>and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost

<P>impassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent

<P>the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after

<P>sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury

<P>of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down Marmion, and beginning-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'Day set on Norham's castled steep,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And Cheviot's mountains lone;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The massive towers, the donjon keep,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The flanking walls that round them sweep,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In yellow lustre shone'-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I soon forgot storm in music.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No;
it was

<P>St. John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen

<P>hurricane- the howling darkness- and stood before me: the cloak that

<P>covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in

<P>consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the

<P>blocked-up vale that night.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Any ill news?' I demanded. 'Has anything happened?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. How very easily alarmed you are!' he answered, removing
his

<P>cloak and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again

<P>coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped

<P>the snow from his boots.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall sully the purity of your floor,' said he, 'but
you must

<P>excuse me for once.' Then he approached the fire. 'I have had hard

<P>work to get here, I assure you,' he observed, as he warmed his hands

<P>over the flame. 'One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow

<P>is quite soft yet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But why are you come?' I could not forbear saying.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but
since you

<P>ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired
of

<P>my mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have

<P>experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been

<P>half-told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday,
and

<P>really I began to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane,

<P>however, his was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never

<P>seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled

<P>marble than it did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from

<P>his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and

<P>cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of

<P>care or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say

<P>something I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his

<P>chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his

<P>hand looked wasted like his face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of

<P>pity came over my heart: I was moved to say-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it
is too bad

<P>that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your

<P>own health.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all,' said he: 'I care for myself when necessary.
I am well

<P>now. What do you see amiss in me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference,
which

<P>showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly

<P>superfluous. I was silenced.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and
still

<P>his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say

<P>something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from

<P>the door, which was behind him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no!' he responded shortly and somewhat testily.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' I reflected, 'if you won't talk, you may be still;
I'll let

<P>you alone now, and return to my book.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of Marmion.
He soon

<P>stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out

<P>a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in

<P>silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain

<P>to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could

<P>I, in my impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he

<P>liked, but talk I would.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?

<P>You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall
me.' Baffled

<P>so far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the

<P>school and my scholars.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to
the

<P>school this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from

<P>the Foundry Close- they would have come to-day but for the snow.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Oliver pays for two.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does he?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was it your suggestion?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whose, then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His daughter's, I think.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is like her: she is so good-natured.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight
strokes. It

<P>aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the
fire,' he

<P>said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Half an hour ago,' he pursued, 'I spoke of my impatience
to hear

<P>the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be

<P>better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting

<P>you into a listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you

<P>that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale

<P>details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through

<P>new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twenty years ago, a poor curate- never mind his name at
this

<P>moment- fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with

<P>him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who

<P>consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two

<P>years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by

<P>side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the

<P>pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old

<P>daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap-

<P>cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.

<P>Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal

<P>relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names

<P>now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You start- did you hear a noise? I

<P>daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining

<P>schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and

<P>barns are generally haunted by rats.- To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the

<P>orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot

<P>say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she

<P>transferred it to a place you know- being no other than Lowood School,

<P>where you so long resided yourself. It seems her career there was very

<P>honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like yourself-

<P>really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and

<P>yours- she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were

<P>analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.

<P>Rochester.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rivers!' I interrupted.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can guess your feelings,' he said, 'but restrain them
for a

<P>while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr.

<P>Rochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact that he

<P>professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that
at

<P>the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive, though a

<P>lunatic. What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter
of

<P>pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry

<P>after the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone- no

<P>one could tell when, where, or how. She had left Thornfield Hall in

<P>the night; every research after her course had been vain: the

<P>country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could

<P>be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be found is become a

<P>matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the

<P>papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a

<P>solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is it not

<P>an odd tale?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just tell me this,' said I, 'and since you know so much,
you

<P>surely can tell it me- what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he?

<P>What is he doing? Is he well?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter
never

<P>mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I

<P>have adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess- the

<P>nature of the event which requires her appearance.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see
Mr.

<P>Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose not.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But they wrote to him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what did he say? Who has his letters?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application
was not

<P>from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed "Alice Fairfax."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably
true:

<P>he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless

<P>desperation to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for

<P>his severe sufferings- what object for his strong passions- had he

<P>sought there? I dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master-

<P>once almost my husband- whom I had often called 'my dear Edward!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He must have been a bad man,' observed Mr. Rivers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't know him- don't pronounce an opinion upon him,'
I

<P>said, with warmth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well,' he answered quietly: 'and indeed my head is

<P>otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since

<P>you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.

<P>Stay! I have it here- it is always more satisfactory to see

<P>important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened,
sought

<P>through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of

<P>paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains
of

<P>ultra-marine, and lake, and vermilion, the ravished margin of the

<P>portrait-cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read,

<P>traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words 'JANE EYRE'-

<P>the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:' he said, 'the advertisements

<P>demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.- I confess I had my

<P>suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once

<P>resolved into certainty. You own the name and renounce the alias?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more
of Mr.

<P>Rochester than you do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything
at all

<P>about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.

<P>Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do

<P>not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you- what he wanted with you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, what did he want?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira,
is

<P>dead; that he has left you all his property, and that you are now

<P>rich- merely that- nothing more.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I!- rich?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, you, rich- quite an heiress.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence succeeded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must prove your identity of course,' resumed St. John

<P>presently: 'a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then

<P>enter on immediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English

<P>funds; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader,
to be

<P>lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth- a very fine thing; but

<P>not a matter one can comprehend or consequently enjoy, all at once.

<P>And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and

<P>rapture-giving: this is solid, an affair of the actual world,

<P>nothing ideal about it: all its associations are solid and sober,

<P>and its manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and spring,

<P>and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to

<P>consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady

<P>satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and

<P>brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with
the words,

<P>Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead- my only relative;

<P>ever since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope

<P>of one day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came

<P>only to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.

<P>It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious-

<P>yes, I felt that- that thought swelled my heart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You unbend your forehead at last,' said Mr. Rivers. 'I
thought

<P>Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.

<P>Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How much am I worth?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of- twenty thousand

<P>pounds, I think they say- but what is that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twenty thousand pounds?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was a new stunner- I had been calculating on four
or five

<P>thousand. This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St.

<P>John, whom I had never heard laugh before, laughed now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' said he, 'if you had committed a murder, and I
had told you

<P>your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a large sum- don't you think there is a mistake?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No mistake at all.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you have read the figures wrong- it may be two
thousand!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is written in letters, not figures,- twenty thousand.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical

<P>powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions

<P>for a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If it were not such a very wild night,' he said, 'I would
send

<P>Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable
to

<P>be left alone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts

<P>so well as I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you

<P>to your sorrows. Good-night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to
me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Stop one minute!' I cried.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about
me; or how

<P>he knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way

<P>place, had the power to aid in my discovery.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I am a clergyman,' he said; 'and the clergy are often
appealed

<P>to about odd matters.' Again the latch rattled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; that does not satisfy me!' I exclaimed: and indeed
there was

<P>something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of

<P>allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a very strange piece of business,' I added; 'I must
know

<P>more about it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Another time.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; to-night!- to-night!' and as he turned from the door,
I placed

<P>myself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,'
I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would rather not just now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall!- you must!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax:

<P>gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I apprised you that I was a hard man,' said he, 'difficult

<P>to persuade.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I am a hard woman,- impossible to put off.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And then,' he pursued, 'I am cold: no fervour infects
me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there
has

<P>thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has

<P>streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you

<P>hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and

<P>misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to

<P>know.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, then,' he said, 'I yield; if not to your earnestness,
to

<P>your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides,

<P>you must know some day,- as well now as later. Your name is Jane

<P>Eyre?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: that was all settled before.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?-
that I was

<P>christened St. John Eyre Rivers?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised
in

<P>your initials written in books you have at different times lent me;

<P>but I never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much
less to

<P>express, the thought that rushed upon me- that embodied itself,- that,

<P>in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit

<P>themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had

<P>been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out

<P>straight,- every ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew,
by

<P>instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word;

<P>but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive

<P>perception, so I must repeat his explanation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a

<P>clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John

<P>Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being

<P>Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our

<P>uncle's death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother

<P>the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a

<P>quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a

<P>few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking

<P>if we knew anything of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper

<P>has enabled me to find her out. You know the rest.' Again he was

<P>going, but I set my back against the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do let me speak,' I said; 'let me have one moment to draw
breath

<P>and reflect.' I paused- he stood before me, hat in hand, looking

<P>composed enough. I resumed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your mother was my father's sister?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My aunt, consequently?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He bowed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary
are his

<P>sister's children, as I am his brother's child?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Undeniably.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each
side flows

<P>from the same source?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We are cousins; yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I
could be

<P>proud of,- one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were

<P>such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had

<P>inspired me with genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on

<P>whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low,

<P>latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a

<P>mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young

<P>and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold

<P>was my blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was

<P>wealth indeed!- wealth to the heart!- a mine of pure, genial

<P>affections. This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;- not

<P>like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in its way,

<P>but sobering from its weight. I now clapped my hands in sudden joy-
my

<P>pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I am glad!- I am glad!' I exclaimed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John smiled. 'Did I not say you neglected essential
points to

<P>pursue trifles?' he asked. 'You were serious when I told you you had

<P>got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What can you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you
have sisters

<P>and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three

<P>relations,- or two, if you don't choose to be counted,- are born

<P>into my world full-grown. I say again, I am glad!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated
with the

<P>thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle

<P>them:- thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that

<P>ere long. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with

<P>ascending stars,- every one lit me to a purpose or delight. Those

<P>who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I

<P>could now benefit. They were under a yoke,- I could free them: they

<P>were scattered,- I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence

<P>which was mine, might be theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand

<P>pounds shared equally, would be five thousand each,- enough and to

<P>spare: justice would be done,- mutual happiness secured. Now the

<P>wealth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,-
it

<P>was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by
storm, I

<P>cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair

<P>behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He

<P>also advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of

<P>helplessness and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk

<P>about again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,' I said, 'and tell
them to come

<P>home directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich

<P>with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,' said St.
John; 'you

<P>must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest
have on you?

<P>Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and

<P>settle down like an ordinary mortal?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too
abrupt

<P>in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational

<P>enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to

<P>misunderstand.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully,
I should

<P>comprehend better.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to
see that

<P>twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between

<P>the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to

<P>each? What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell

<P>them of the fortune that has accrued to them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To you, you mean.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of
taking any

<P>other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly

<P>ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.

<P>I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and

<P>Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would

<P>please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment

<P>and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never

<P>be mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then,

<P>what is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition,

<P>and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and

<P>decide the point at once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to
consider

<P>such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see
the

<P>justice of the case?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all
custom.

<P>Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his

<P>own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to

<P>you. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a

<P>clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With me,' said I, 'it is fully as much a matter of feeling
as of

<P>conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an

<P>opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for
a

<P>year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught

<P>a glimpse- that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning

<P>to myself life-long friends.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You think so now,' rejoined St. John, 'because you do
not know

<P>what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot

<P>form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you;

<P>of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the

<P>prospects it would open to you: you cannot-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you,' I interrupted, 'cannot at all imagine the craving
I have

<P>for fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had

<P>brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not

<P>reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I will be your brother- my sisters will be your
sisters-

<P>without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters?
Yes;

<P>slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy- gorged with gold I never earned

<P>and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and

<P>fraternisation! Close union! Intimate attachment!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic

<P>happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate:

<P>you may marry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense, again! Marry! I don't want to marry, and never
shall

<P>marry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are
a proof

<P>of the excitement under which you labour.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how
averse

<P>are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take

<P>me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money

<P>speculation. And I do not want a stranger- unsympathising, alien,

<P>different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full

<P>fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the

<P>words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them

<P>sincerely.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters;
and I

<P>know on what my affection for them is grounded,- respect for their

<P>worth and admiration of their talents. You too have principle and

<P>mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your

<P>presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have

<P>already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and

<P>naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest

<P>sister.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had
better go;

<P>for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some

<P>mistrustful scruple.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had,
and

<P>arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I

<P>wished. My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely

<P>resolved- as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and

<P>immutably fixed on making a just division of the property- as they

<P>must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and

<P>must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place they

<P>would have done precisely what I wished to do- they yielded at

<P>length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration. The

<P>judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
my

<P>opinion: I carried my point. The instruments of transfer were drawn

<P>out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a

<P>competency.
