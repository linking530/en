<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I CONTINUED the labours of the village-school as actively
and

<P>faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time

<P>elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars

<P>and their nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they

<P>seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but

<P>I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as

<P>amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this

<P>difference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my

<P>language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these

<P>heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls

<P>enough. Many showed themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I

<P>discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness,

<P>and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won

<P>both my good-will and my admiration. These soon took a pleasure in

<P>doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning

<P>their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The

<P>rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even surprising;

<P>and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began

<P>personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I had

<P>amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,

<P>almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught

<P>the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of

<P>needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them- characters

<P>desirous of information and disposed for improvement- with whom I

<P>passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their

<P>parents then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.

<P>There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in

<P>repaying it by a consideration- a scrupulous regard to their feelings-

<P>to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which

<P>both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in

<P>their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential

<P>treatment they received.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever
I went

<P>out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with

<P>friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the

<P>regard of working people, is like 'sitting in sunshine, calm and

<P>sweet'; serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this

<P>period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than

<P>sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst
of

<P>this calm, this useful existence- after a day passed in honourable

<P>exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading

<P>contentedly alone- I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams

<P>many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the

<P>stormy- dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure,

<P>with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met

<P>Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of

<P>being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his

<P>hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him- the hope of passing

<P>a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and

<P>fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated.

<P>Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and

<P>then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and

<P>heard the burst of passion. By nine o'clock the next morning I was

<P>punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the

<P>steady duties of the day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her
call at

<P>the school was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She

<P>would canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted

<P>livery servant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her

<P>purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed

<P>gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to

<P>her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would

<P>enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of

<P>the village children. She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers

<P>was engaged in giving his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear,

<P>did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor's heart. A sort

<P>of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance, even when he did not

<P>see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door, if she

<P>appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming features,

<P>though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very

<P>quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than

<P>working muscle or darting glance could indicate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because
he could

<P>not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she

<P>went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even

<P>fondly in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed

<P>to say, with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with

<P>his lips, 'I love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair

<P>of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you

<P>would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the

<P>fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice

<P>consumed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive

<P>cloud would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand

<P>hastily from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect,

<P>at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have

<P>given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him;

<P>but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the

<P>elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.

<P>Besides, he could not bind all that he had in his nature- the rover,

<P>the aspirant, the poet, the priest- in the limits of a single passion.

<P>He could not- he would not- renounce his wild field of mission warfare

<P>for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from

<P>himself in an inroad I once, despite his reserve, had the daring to

<P>make on his confidence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to
my cottage.

<P>I had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or

<P>disguise: she was coquettish, but not heartless; exacting, but not

<P>worthlessly selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not

<P>absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could

<P>not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush
of

<P>loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride

<P>of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and

<P>unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer

<P>of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or

<P>thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from

<P>that, for instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her

<P>almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except that, for a child whom we

<P>have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than
we

<P>can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was
like Mr.

<P>Rivers, only, certainly, she allowed, 'not one-tenth so handsome,

<P>though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.' I

<P>was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a

<P>lusus naturae, she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure

<P>my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity,
and

<P>thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the

<P>cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered

<P>first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and

<P>dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including

<P>a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars,

<P>and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the

<P>surrounding moors. She was first transfixed with surprise, and then

<P>electrified with delight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German?
What a

<P>love- what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With pleasure,' I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight

<P>at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had

<P>then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her

<P>only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders

<P>with all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine

<P>card-board, and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure

<P>of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must

<P>come and sit another day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver
himself

<P>accompanied her next evening- a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged,

<P>and grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a

<P>bright flower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps

<P>a proud personage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of

<P>Rosamond's portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished

<P>picture of it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend

<P>the evening at Vale Hall.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing
abundant

<P>evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and

<P>pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he

<P>entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong

<P>terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said
he

<P>only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,

<P>and would soon quit it for one more suitable.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed,' cried Rosamond, 'she is clever enough to be a
governess

<P>in a high family, papa.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any
high

<P>family in the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers- of the Rivers

<P>family- with great respect. He said it was a very old name in that

<P>neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that

<P>all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he considered

<P>the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an

<P>alliance with the best. He accounted it a pity that so fine and

<P>talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a

<P>missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away. It appeared,

<P>then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond's

<P>union with St. John. Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young

<P>clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as

<P>sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant,
after

<P>helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee
of

<P>a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright- scoured

<P>floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made

<P>myself neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour;
then I

<P>got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because

<P>easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature. The head

<P>was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the

<P>drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe

<P>lips- a soft curl here and there to the tresses- a deeper tinge to the

<P>shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the

<P>execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door

<P>unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,' he
said.

<P>'Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will

<P>not feel lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have

<P>borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening

<P>solace,' and he laid on the table a new publication- a poem: one of

<P>those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate

<P>public of those days- the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the

<P>readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause

<P>either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius

<P>lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they

<P>will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and

<P>strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile

<P>when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their

<P>destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no:
do

<P>not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but

<P>reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread

<P>everywhere, you would be in hell- the hell of your own meanness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of Marmion
(for

<P>Marmion it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall

<P>figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up

<P>at him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read

<P>his heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I

<P>had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an

<P>inclination to do him some good, if I could.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With all his firmness and self-control,' thought I, 'he
tasks

<P>himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within- expresses,

<P>confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a

<P>little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to

<P>marry: I will make him talk.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said first, 'Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.' But he answered,
as he

<P>always did, that he could not stay. 'Very well,' I responded,

<P>mentally, 'stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am

<P>determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.

<P>I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence,

<P>and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed

<P>one drop of the balm of sympathy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is this portrait like?' I asked bluntly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did, Mr. Rivers.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness:
he looked at

<P>me astonished. 'Oh, that is nothing yet,' I muttered within. 'I

<P>don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm

<P>prepared to go to considerable lengths.' I continued, 'You observed
it

<P>closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at

<P>it again,' and I rose and placed it in his hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A well-executed picture,' he said; 'very soft, clear colouring;

<P>very graceful and correct drawing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance?
Who is

<P>it like?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mastering some hesitation, he answered, 'Miss Oliver, I
presume.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate
guess, I

<P>will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this

<P>very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable

<P>to you. I don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an

<P>offering you would deem worthless.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked,
the

<P>firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. 'It is like!' he

<P>murmured; 'the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are

<P>perfect. It smiles!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar

<P>painting? Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape,
or

<P>in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your

<P>possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated
to

<P>enervate and distress?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,

<P>disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would
be

<P>judicious or wise is another question.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred
him, and

<P>that her father was not likely to oppose the match, I- less exalted
in

<P>my views than St. John- had been strongly disposed in my own heart

<P>to advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the

<P>possessor of Mr. Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with

<P>it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength

<P>to waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious
if you

<P>were to take to yourself the original at once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on
the

<P>table before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung

<P>fondly over it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at
my

<P>audacity. I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject
he

<P>had deemed unapproachable- to hear it thus freely handled- was

<P>beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure- an unhoped-for

<P>relief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of

<P>their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The

<P>sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to 'burst' with

<P>boldness and good-will into 'the silent sea' of their souls is often

<P>to confer on them the first of obligations.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She likes you, I am sure,' said I, as I stood behind his
chair,

<P>'and her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl- rather

<P>thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself

<P>and her. You ought to marry her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does she like me?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks
of you

<P>continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon
so

<P>often.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is very pleasant to hear this,' he said- 'very: go
on for

<P>another quarter of an hour.' And he actually took out his watch and

<P>laid it upon the table to measure the time.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But where is the use of going on,' I asked, 'when you
are probably

<P>preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain
to

<P>fetter your heart?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and
melting,

<P>as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in

<P>my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have

<P>so carefully and with such labour prepared- so assiduously sown with

<P>the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is

<P>deluged with a nectarous flood- the young germs swamped- delicious

<P>poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the

<P>drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is

<P>talking to me with her sweet voice- gazing down on me with those

<P>eyes your skilful hand has copied so well- smiling at me with these

<P>coral lips. She is mine- I am hers- this present life and passing

<P>world suffice to me. Hush! say nothing- my heart is full of delight-

<P>my senses are entranced- let the time I marked pass in peace.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and
low: I

<P>stood silent. Amidst this hush the quarter sped; he replaced the

<P>watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' said he, 'that little space was given to delirium
and

<P>delusion. I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put

<P>my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The

<P>pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a

<P>bitter taste: her promises are hollow- her offers false: I see and

<P>know all this.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I gazed at him in wonder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is strange,' pursued he, 'that while I love Rosamond
Oliver

<P>so wildly- with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the

<P>object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, and fascinating-
I

<P>experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she

<P>would not make me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to

<P>me; that I should discover this within a year after marriage; and that

<P>to twelve months' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I

<P>know.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Strange indeed!' I could not help ejaculating.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'While something in me,' he went on, 'is acutely sensible
to her

<P>charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they

<P>are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to- co-operate

<P>in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female

<P>apostle? Rosamond a missionary's wife? No!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish
that

<P>scheme.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation
laid

<P>on earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the

<P>band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering

<P>their race- of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance- of

<P>substituting peace for war- freedom for bondage- religion for

<P>superstition- the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I

<P>relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what
I

<P>have to look forward to, and to live for.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After a considerable pause, I said- 'And Miss Oliver? Are
her

<P>disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers:
in

<P>less than a month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will

<P>forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far

<P>happier than I should do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.
You are

<P>wasting away.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my
prospects,

<P>yet unsettled- my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this

<P>morning, I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I

<P>have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three

<P>months to come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters
the

<P>schoolroom.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had
not

<P>imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I

<P>felt at home in this sort of discourse. I could never rest in

<P>communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male

<P>or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and

<P>crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their

<P>heart's very hearthstone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are original,' said he, 'and not timid. There is something

<P>brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow
me

<P>to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think

<P>them more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger

<P>allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour,

<P>and when I shake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the

<P>weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I

<P>declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed as a

<P>rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I

<P>am- a cold, hard man.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled incredulously.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have taken my confidence by storm,' he continued,
'and now

<P>it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state-

<P>stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers

<P>human deformity- a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection

<P>only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason,

<P>and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to

<P>rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance,

<P>perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which

<P>men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your

<P>career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent,

<P>orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what

<P>you have gone through, or what you still suffer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,'
I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. There is this difference between me and deistic

<P>philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your

<P>epithet. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher- a follower

<P>of the sect of Jesus. As His disciple I adopt His pure, His

<P>merciful, His benignant doctrines. I advocate them: I am sworn to

<P>spread them. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my

<P>original qualities thus:- From the minute germ, natural affection, she

<P>has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild

<P>stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of the

<P>Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power and renown for my

<P>wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's

<P>kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross. So much

<P>has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best

<P>account; pruning and training nature. But she could not eradicate

<P>nature: nor will it be eradicated "till this mortal shall put on

<P>immortality."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table
beside my

<P>palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is lovely,' he murmured. 'She is well named the Rose
of the

<P>World, indeed!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And may I not paint one like it for you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cui bono? No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which
I was

<P>accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the card-board from

<P>being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was

<P>impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took

<P>it up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at

<P>me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance

<P>that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face,

<P>and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips

<P>parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever

<P>it was.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the matter?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing in the world,' was the reply; and, replacing the
paper,

<P>I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It

<P>disappeared in his glove; and, with one hasty nod and

<P>'good-afternoon,' he vanished.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well!' I exclaimed, using an expression of the district,
'that

<P>caps the globe, however!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on
it save

<P>a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.
I

<P>pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and

<P>being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon

<P>forgot it.
