<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable

<P>antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep

<P>buried in a wood. I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often

<P>spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His father had purchased the

<P>estate for the sake of the game covers. He would have let the house,

<P>but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and

<P>insalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished,

<P>with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the

<P>accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked
by the

<P>characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating

<P>rain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise

<P>and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when

<P>within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing

<P>of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about

<P>it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and

<P>passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of

<P>close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the

<P>forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.

<P>I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it

<P>stretched on and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation

<P>or grounds was visible.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.
The

<P>darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I

<P>looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was

<P>interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage- no opening

<P>anywhere.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a
little;

<P>presently I beheld a railing, then the house- scarce, by this dim

<P>light, distinguishable from the trees, so dank and green were its

<P>decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood

<P>amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in
a

<P>semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad

<P>gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame

<P>of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front;

<P>the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too,

<P>one step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the

<P>Rochester Arms had said, 'quite a desolate spot.' It was as still as
a

<P>church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was

<P>the only sound audible in its vicinage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can there be life here?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement-
that

<P>narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue

<P>from the grange.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and
stood

<P>on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if
to

<P>feel whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him- it was

<P>my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch
him- to

<P>examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a

<P>sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by

<P>pain. I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation,
my

<P>step from hasty advance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as
ever: his

<P>port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his

<P>features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow,

<P>could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.

<P>But in his countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and

<P>brooding- that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast

<P>or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle,

<P>whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as

<P>looked that sightless Samson.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?-
if

<P>you do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon

<P>I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips

<P>so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly

<P>towards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he

<P>paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and

<P>opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the

<P>sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was

<P>void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the

<P>mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by

<P>touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy

<P>still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood. He

<P>relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and

<P>mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head. At this

<P>moment John approached him from some quarter.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you take my arm, sir?' he said; 'there is a heavy
shower

<P>coming on: had you not better go in?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let me alone,' was the answer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester
now tried

<P>to walk about: vainly,- all was too uncertain. He groped his way

<P>back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.
'Mary,' I

<P>said, 'how are you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To
her

<P>hurried 'Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely

<P>place?' I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into

<P>the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them,

<P>in a few words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left

<P>Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John

<P>to go down to the turnpike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise,

<P>and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I

<P>removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could

<P>be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that

<P>arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be

<P>impossible, I informed her I should stay. just at this moment the

<P>parlour-bell rang.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When you go in,' said I, 'tell your master that a person
wishes to

<P>speak to him, but do not give my name.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think he will see you,' she answered; 'he refuses

<P>everybody.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When she returned, I inquired what he had said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are to send in your name and your business,' she replied.

<P>She then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray,

<P>together with candles.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that what he rang for?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though
he is

<P>blind.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour
door. The

<P>tray shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart

<P>struck my ribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut
it

<P>behind me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire
burnt low

<P>in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against

<P>the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of

<P>the room. His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way,

<P>and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.

<P>Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a

<P>yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray

<P>from my hands. I set it on the table; then patted him, and said

<P>softly, 'Lie down!' Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to see what

<P>the commotion was: but as he saw nothing, he returned and sighed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give me the water, Mary,' he said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot

<P>followed me, still excited.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the matter?' he inquired.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Down, Pilot!' I again said. He checked the water on its
way to his

<P>lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. 'This
is

<P>you, Mary, is it not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mary is in the kitchen,' I answered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing
where I

<P>stood, he did not touch me. 'Who is this? Who is this?' he demanded,

<P>trying, as it seemed, to see with those sightless eyes- unavailing and

<P>distressing attempt! 'Answer me- speak again!' he ordered, imperiously

<P>and aloud.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of
what was

<P>in the glass,' I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who is it? What is it? Who speaks?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came
only this

<P>evening,' I answered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Great God!- what delusion has come over me? What sweet
madness has

<P>seized me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No delusion- no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong
for

<P>delusion, your health too sound for frenzy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot
see,

<P>but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever-

<P>whoever you are- be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned
it in both

<P>mine.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Her very fingers!' he cried; 'her small, slight fingers!
If so

<P>there must be more of her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized,
my

<P>shoulder- neck- waist- I was entwined and gathered to him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it Jane? What is it? This is her shape- this is her
size-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this her voice,' I added. 'She is all here: her heart,
too.

<P>God bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane Eyre!- Jane Eyre,' was all he said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dear master,' I answered, 'I am Jane Eyre: I have found
you

<P>out- I am come back to you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In truth?- in the flesh? My living Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You touch me, sir,- you hold me, and fast enough: I am
not cold

<P>like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and
these her

<P>features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a

<P>dream; such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once

<P>more to my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus- and felt

<P>that she loved me, and trusted that she would not leave me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which I never will, sir, from this day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found
it an

<P>empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned- my life dark, lonely,

<P>hopeless- my soul athirst and forbidden to drink- my heart famished

<P>and never to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now,

<P>you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but

<P>kiss me before you go- embrace me, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, sir- and there!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless
eyes- I

<P>swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly

<P>seemed to arouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this

<P>seized him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is you- is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?
And you

<P>are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir! I am an independent woman now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Independent! What do you mean, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand
pounds.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! this is practical- this is real!' he cried: 'I should
never

<P>dream that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so

<P>animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart;

<P>it puts life into it.- What, Janet! Are you an independent woman? A

<P>rich woman?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Quite rich, sir. If you won't let me live with you, I
can build

<P>a house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in

<P>my parlour when you want company of an evening.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends
who

<P>will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a

<P>blind lameter like me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am
my own

<P>mistress.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you will stay with me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly- unless you object. I will be your neighbour,
your

<P>nurse, your housekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your

<P>companion- to read to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to

<P>wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy,

<P>my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He replied not: he seemed serious- abstracted; he sighed;
he

<P>half-opened his lips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a

<P>little embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly overleaped

<P>conventionalities; and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my

<P>inconsiderateness. I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that
he

<P>wished and would ask me to be his wife: an expectation, not the less

<P>certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim

<P>me at once as his own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his

<P>countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might

<P>have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and

<P>I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms- but he eagerly

<P>snatched me closer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- no- Jane; you must not go. No- I have touched you,
heard

<P>you, felt the comfort of your presence- the sweetness of your

<P>consolation: I cannot give up these joys. I have little left in

<P>myself- I must have you. The world may laugh- may call me absurd,

<P>selfish- but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will
be

<P>satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- but you understand one thing by staying with me;
and I

<P>understand another. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be

<P>about my hand and chair- to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you

<P>have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you

<P>to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice

<P>for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly

<P>feelings for you: do you think so? Come- tell me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only
your

<P>nurse, if you think it better.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young-
you

<P>must marry one day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't care about being married.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would
try

<P>to make you care- but- a sightless block!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became
more

<P>cheerful, and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an

<P>insight as to where the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty

<P>with me, I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment. I

<P>resumed a livelier vein of conversation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,' said
I,

<P>parting his thick and long uncut locks; 'for I see you are being

<P>metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort. You have a "faux

<P>air" of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain:

<P>your hair reminds me of eagles' feathers; whether your nails are grown

<P>like birds' claws or not, I have not yet noticed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,' he said,
drawing

<P>the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. 'It is a

<P>mere stump- a ghastly sight! Don't you think so, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes- and
the

<P>scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in

<P>danger of loving you too well for all this; and making too much of

<P>you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my
arm, and my

<P>cicatrised visage.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you? Don't tell me so- lest I should say something
disparaging

<P>to your judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better

<P>fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a

<P>good fire?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; with the right eye I see a glow- a ruddy haze.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you see the candles?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very dimly- each is a luminous cloud.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you see me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel
you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When do you take supper?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never take supper.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are
you, I

<P>daresay, only you forget.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order:
I

<P>prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited,

<P>and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a

<P>long time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of

<P>glee and vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease,

<P>because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed either to

<P>console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life

<P>and light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and

<P>he lived in mine. Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy

<P>dawned on his forehead: his lineaments softened and warmed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where
I had

<P>been, what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him

<P>only very partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars

<P>that night. Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord- to

<P>open no fresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was
to

<P>cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits. If

<P>a moment's silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless,

<P>touch me, then say, 'Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are altogether a human being, Janet? You are certain
of that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so
suddenly

<P>rise on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water

<P>from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question,

<P>expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending
with

<P>you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged
on

<P>for months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in

<P>day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out,

<P>of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at

<P>times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her

<P>restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can

<P>it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart

<P>as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his
own

<P>disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him

<P>in this frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and

<P>remarked that they were scorched, and that I would apply something

<P>which would make them grow as broad and black as ever.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent
spirit,

<P>when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me- passing like a

<P>shadow, whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards

<P>undiscoverable?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What for, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather

<P>alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a

<P>fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I hideous, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very, sir: you always were, you know.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever

<P>you have sojourned.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet I have been with good people; far better than you:
a hundred

<P>times better people; possessed of ideas and views you never

<P>entertained in your life: quite more refined and exalted.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who the deuce have you been with?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair
out of

<P>your head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my

<P>substantiality.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who have you been with, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must
wait till

<P>to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of

<P>security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.

<P>By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass

<P>of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of

<P>fried ham.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You mocking changeling- fairy-born and human-bred! You
make me

<P>feel as I have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had

<P>you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without

<P>the aid of the harp.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I'll
leave you: I

<P>have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am

<P>tired. Good night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house
where you

<P>have been?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.

<P>'A good idea!' I thought with glee. 'I see I have the means of

<P>fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering

<P>from one room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the

<P>question: 'Is Miss Eyre here?' Then: 'Which room did you put her into?

<P>Was it dry? Is she up? Go and ask if she wants anything; and when

<P>she will come down.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of
breakfast.

<P>Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he

<P>discovered my presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the

<P>subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat

<P>in his chair- still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines

<P>of now habitual sadness marking his strong features. His countenance

<P>reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit- and alas! it

<P>was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated

<P>expression: he was dependent on another for that office! I had meant

<P>to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man

<P>touched my heart to the quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity

<P>I could.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,' I said. 'The rain
is over and

<P>gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk

<P>soon.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You
are not

<P>gone: not vanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high

<P>over the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the

<P>rising sun had rays. All the melody on earth is concentrated in my

<P>Jane's tongue to my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent

<P>one): all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence;

<P>just as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to

<P>entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be

<P>lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with

<P>preparing breakfast.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him
out of the

<P>wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how

<P>brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked

<P>refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him

<P>in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse

<P>to let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should I, when both

<P>he and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was

<P>quiet. He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when
I discovered

<P>you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you;

<P>and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken
no

<P>money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl

<P>necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your

<P>trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the

<P>bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and

<P>penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for
the last

<P>year. I softened considerably what related to the three days of

<P>wandering and starvation, because to have told him all would have been

<P>to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his

<P>faithful heart deeper than I wished.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means
of

<P>making my way: I should have told him my intention. I should have

<P>confided in him: he would never have forced me to be his mistress.

<P>Violent as he had seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far

<P>too well and too tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would

<P>have given me half his fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss
in

<P>return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless on the

<P>wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed

<P>to him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very
short,' I

<P>answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received

<P>at Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, etc.

<P>The accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in

<P>due order. Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in

<P>the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately

<P>taken up.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This St. John, then, is your cousin?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have spoken of him often: do you like him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted
man of

<P>fifty? Or what does it mean?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John was only twenty-nine, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Jeune encore," as the French say. Is he a person of low

<P>stature, phlegmatic, and plain? A person whose goodness consists

<P>rather in his guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what
he lives

<P>to perform.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means
well: but

<P>you shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the
point. His

<P>brain is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is he an able man, then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Truly able.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A thoroughly educated man?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?-
priggish

<P>and parsonic?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very
bad taste,

<P>they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His appearance,- I forget what description you gave of
his

<P>appearance;- a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white

<P>neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair,
with blue

<P>eyes, and a Grecian profile.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Aside.) 'Damn him!'- (To me.) 'Did you like him, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that
before.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy

<P>had got hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it

<P>gave him respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I would not,

<P>therefore, immediately charm the snake.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee,
Miss

<P>Eyre?' was the next somewhat unexpected observation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why not, Mr. Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather
too

<P>overwhelming contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a

<P>graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,- tall, fair,

<P>blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,-
a

<P>real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into

<P>the bargain.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather
like

<P>Vulcan, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go' (and
he

<P>retained me by a firmer grasp than ever), 'you will be pleased just
to

<P>answer me a question or two.' He paused.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What questions, Mr. Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then followed this cross-examination.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew
you were

<P>his cousin?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Daily.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would
be clever,

<P>for you are a talented creature!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He approved of them- yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He would discover many things in you he could not have
expected to

<P>find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know about that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did
he ever

<P>come there to see you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now and then.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of an evening?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once or twice.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pause.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long did you reside with him and his sisters after
the

<P>cousinship was discovered?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Five months.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he
sat near the

<P>window, and we by the table.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did he study much?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A good deal.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hindostanee.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what did you do meantime?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I learnt German, at first.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did he teach you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He did not understand German.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did he teach you nothing?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little Hindostanee.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rivers taught you Hindostanee?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And his sisters also?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you ask to learn?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He wished to teach you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A second pause.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to
you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He intended me to go with him to India.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you
to marry

<P>him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He asked me to marry him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is a fiction- an impudent invention to vex me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me
more

<P>than once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could

<P>be.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am
I to say

<P>the same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee,

<P>when I have given you notice to quit?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I am comfortable there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your
heart is not

<P>with me: it is with this cousin- this St. John. Oh, till this

<P>moment, I thought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she

<P>loved me even when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much

<P>bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our

<P>separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her, she was

<P>loving another! But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and

<P>marry Rivers.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shake me off, then, sir,- push me away, for I'll not leave
you

<P>of my own accord.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews
hope, it

<P>sounds so truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I

<P>forget that you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where must I go, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your own way- with the husband you have chosen.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who is that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know- this St. John Rivers.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love
me: I

<P>do not love him. He loves (as he can love, and that is not as you

<P>love) a beautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me

<P>only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife,

<P>which she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe;

<P>and, for me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not

<P>happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence

<P>for me- no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth-

<P>only a few useful mental points- Then I must leave you, sir, to go

<P>to him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer
to my

<P>blind but beloved master. He smiled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of
matters

<P>between you and Rivers?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted
to tease

<P>you a little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better

<P>than grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much

<P>I do love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is

<P>yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate

<P>to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My seared vision! My crippled strength!' he murmured regretfully.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was
thinking,

<P>and wanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his

<P>face a minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and

<P>trickle down the manly cheek. My heart swelled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree
in

<P>Thornfield orchard,' he remarked ere long. 'And what right would

<P>that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with

<P>freshness?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are no ruin, sir- no lightning-struck tree: you are
green

<P>and vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask

<P>them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and

<P>as they grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because

<P>your strength offers them so safe a prop.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You speak of friends, Jane?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, of friends,' I answered rather hesitatingly: for
I knew I

<P>meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.

<P>He helped me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes: is it news to you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: you said nothing about it before.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it unwelcome news?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That depends on circumstances, sir- on your choice.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your
decision.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Choose then, sir- her who loves you best.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will at least choose- her I love best. Jane, will you
marry me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by
the hand?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you
will have to

<P>wait on?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Truly, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Most truly, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life- if
ever I

<P>thought a good thought- if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless

<P>prayer- if ever I wished a righteous wish,- I am rewarded now. To be

<P>your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you delight in sacrifice.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation
for

<P>content. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value- to

<P>press my lips to what I love- to repose on what I trust: is that to

<P>make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my

<P>deficiencies.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when
I can

<P>really be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud

<P>independence, when you disdained every part but that of the giver

<P>and protector.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hitherto I have hated to be helped- to be led: henceforth,
I

<P>feel I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a

<P>hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little

<P>fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of

<P>servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits

<P>me: do I suit her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait
for: we

<P>must be married instantly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity
was rising.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there
is but the

<P>licence to get- then we marry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined
from

<P>its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me

<P>look at your watch.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward:
I

<P>have no use for it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir. Don't
you feel

<P>hungry?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.
Never

<P>mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze
is still:

<P>it is quite hot.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at
this

<P>moment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn

<P>it since the day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest
way.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but
my heart

<P>swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.
He

<P>sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but

<P>far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower-

<P>breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I,

<P>in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation:

<P>instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice

<P>pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass

<P>through the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are

<P>mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was

<P>proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over

<P>to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane-

<P>only- only of late- I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God

<P>in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for

<P>reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief

<P>prayers they were, but very sincere.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some days since: nay, I can number them- four; it was
last

<P>Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief

<P>replaced frenzy- sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression

<P>that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that

<P>night- perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock- ere I

<P>retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed

<P>good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to

<P>that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which
was open:

<P>it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no

<P>stars, and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a

<P>moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul

<P>and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had

<P>not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not

<P>soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured,

<P>I acknowledged- that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and

<P>the alpha and omega of my heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my

<P>lips in the words- "Jane! Jane! Jane!"'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you speak these words aloud?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have
thought

<P>me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed
is the

<P>strange point. You will think me superstitious- some superstition I

<P>have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true- true

<P>at least it is that I heard what I now relate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As I exclaimed "Jane! Jane! Jane!" a voice- I cannot tell
whence

<P>the voice came, but I know whose voice it was- replied, "I am

<P>coming: wait for me;" and a moment after, went whispering on the

<P>wind the words- "Where are you?"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words

<P>opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to

<P>express. Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where

<P>sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating. "Where are you?" seemed

<P>spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the

<P>words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my

<P>brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane

<P>were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt

<P>were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul

<P>wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents-

<P>as certain as I live- they were yours!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, it was on Monday night- near midnight- that I too
had

<P>received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which

<P>I replied to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made

<P>no disclosure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and

<P>inexplicable to be communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my

<P>tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on

<P>the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too

<P>prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. I

<P>kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You cannot now wonder,' continued my master, 'that when
you rose

<P>upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing

<P>you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would

<P>melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain

<P>echo had melted before. Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise.

<P>Yes, I thank God!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his
hat from

<P>his brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in

<P>mute devotion. Only the last words of the worship were audible.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has

<P>remembered mercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength

<P>to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear
hand,

<P>held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being

<P>so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and

<P>guide. We entered the wood, and wended homeward.
