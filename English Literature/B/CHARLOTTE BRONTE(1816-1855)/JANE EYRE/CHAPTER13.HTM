<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. ROCHESTER, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went
to bed early

<P>that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come

<P>down, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his

<P>tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be
in daily

<P>requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an

<P>apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for

<P>the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that

<P>Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church,

<P>it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of

<P>the bell: steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke

<P>in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing

<P>through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply:
she kept

<P>running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could

<P>get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go

<P>downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,

<P>where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry,

<P>and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her 'ami,

<P>Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,' as she dubbed him (I had not

<P>before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had

<P>brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that

<P>when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it
a

<P>little box in whose contents she had an interest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Et cela doit signifier,' said she, 'qu'il y aura la dedans
un

<P>cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.

<P>Monsieur a parle de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante,

<P>et si elle n'etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu

<P>pale. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour;
the

<P>afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At

<P>dark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run

<P>downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the

<P>cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr.

<P>Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window;

<P>but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together

<P>thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the

<P>curtain and went back to the fireside.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a
picture I

<P>remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine,

<P>when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery

<P>mosaic I had been piecing together, and scattering too some heavy

<P>unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would
take tea

<P>with him in the drawing-room this evening,' said she: 'he has been

<P>so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When is his tea-time?' I inquired.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.
You had

<P>better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here

<P>is a candle.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it necessary to change my frock?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when
Mr.

<P>Rochester is here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however,
I

<P>repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black

<P>stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one

<P>I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the

<P>toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate

<P>occasions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You want a brooch,' said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single
little pearl

<P>ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,

<P>and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was

<P>rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's

<P>presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept

<P>in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch,

<P>whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on
the

<P>mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay

<P>Pilot- Adele knelt near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr.

<P>Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at

<P>Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my

<P>traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made

<P>squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his

<P>decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full

<P>nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and

<P>jaw- yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. His shape, now

<P>divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his

<P>physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of

<P>the term- broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor

<P>graceful.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs.

<P>Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice

<P>us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here is Miss Eyre, sir,' said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet
way. He

<P>bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let Miss Eyre be seated,' said he: and there was something
in

<P>the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed

<P>further to express, 'What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be

<P>there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished
politeness

<P>would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid

<P>it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice

<P>laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence,

<P>under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the

<P>eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see

<P>how he would go on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke
nor

<P>moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one

<P>should be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual- and, as

<P>usual, rather trite- she condoled with him on the pressure of business

<P>he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with

<P>that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and

<P>perseverance in going through with it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, I should like some tea,' was the sole rejoinder
she got.

<P>She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded

<P>to arrange the cups, spoons, etc., with assiduous celerity. I and

<P>Adele went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?' said Mrs. Fairfax
to me;

<P>'Adele might perhaps spill it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adele,

<P>thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour,

<P>cried out-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle
Eyre

<P>dans votre petit coffre?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who talks of cadeaux?' said he gruffly. 'Did you expect
a present,

<P>Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?' and he searched my face with

<P>eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them:
they are

<P>generally thought pleasant things.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Generally thought? But what do you think?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could
give you

<P>an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it,

<P>has it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion

<P>as to its nature.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she
demands

<P>a "cadeau," clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the

<P>bush.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele
has: she

<P>can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom;

<P>for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her

<P>playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since

<P>I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an

<P>acknowledgment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adele,
and

<P>find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has

<P>no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, you have now given me my "cadeau"; I am obliged to
you: it is

<P>the meed teachers most covet-praise of their pupils' progress.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph!' said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come to the fire,' said the master, when the tray was
taken

<P>away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting;

<P>while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me

<P>the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.

<P>We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee,

<P>but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have been resident in my house three months?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you came from-?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eight years.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought
half the

<P>time in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder

<P>you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had

<P>got that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I

<P>thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand

<P>whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your

<P>parents?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have none.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people
when you

<P>sat on that stile?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For whom, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening
for

<P>them. Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that

<P>damned ice on the causeway?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head. 'The men in green all forsook England
a hundred

<P>years ago,' said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. 'And not

<P>even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of

<P>them. I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will

<P>ever shine on their revels more.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised
eyebrows,

<P>seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' resumed Mr. Rochester, 'if you disown parents,
you must

<P>have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; none that I ever saw.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And your home?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have none.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where do your brothers and sisters live?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have no brothers or sisters.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who recommended you to come here?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' said the good lady, who now knew what ground we
were upon,

<P>'and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.

<P>Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and

<P>careful teacher to Adele.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,' returned
Mr.

<P>Rochester: 'eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.

<P>She began by felling my horse.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?' said Mrs. Fairfax.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have to thank her for this sprain.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The widow looked bewildered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you seen much society?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the
inmates of

<P>Thornfield.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you read much?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been
numerous

<P>or very learned.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well
drilled in

<P>religious forms;- Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is

<P>a parson, is he not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full
of

<P>religieuses would worship their director.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her
priest! That

<P>sounds blasphemous.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the
feeling.

<P>He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our

<P>hair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with

<P>which we could hardly sew.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That was very false economy,' remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who
now again

<P>caught the drift of the dialogue.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And was that the head and front of his offending?' demanded
Mr.

<P>Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of
the

<P>provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored

<P>us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from

<P>books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which

<P>made us afraid to go to bed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What age were you when you went to Lowood?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'About ten.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assented.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should
hardly

<P>have been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where

<P>the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your

<P>case. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the
library-

<P>I mean, if you please.- (Excuse my tone of command; I am used to

<P>say, "Do this," and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for

<P>one new inmate.)- Go, then, into the library; take a candle with

<P>you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I departed, obeying his directions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enough!' he called out in a few minutes. 'You play a little,
I

<P>see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than

<P>some, but not well.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she
said were

<P>yours. I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably

<P>a master aided you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed!' I interjected.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio,
if you can

<P>vouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless

<P>you are certain: I can recognise patchwork.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself,
sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought the portfolio from the library.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Approach the table,' said he; and I wheeled it to his
couch. Adele

<P>and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No crowding,' said Mr. Rochester: 'take the drawings from
my

<P>hand as I finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three
he laid

<P>aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,' said
he, 'and

<P>look at them with Adele;- you' (glancing at me) 'resume your seat, and

<P>answer my questions. I perceive those pictures were done by one

<P>hand: was that hand yours?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when did you find time to do them? They have taken
much

<P>time, and some thought.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood,
when I had

<P>no other occupation.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where did you get your copies?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Out of my head.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That head I see now on your shoulders?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Has it other furniture of the same kind within?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should think it may have: I should hope- better.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them

<P>alternately.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what
they are:

<P>and first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The

<P>subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the

<P>spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were

<P>striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it

<P>had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented

<P>clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was

<P>in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest

<P>billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into

<P>relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and

<P>large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set

<P>with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette

<P>could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.

<P>Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through

<P>the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible,

<P>whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second picture contained for foreground only the dim
peak of

<P>a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.

<P>Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight:

<P>rising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in

<P>tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was

<P>crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the

<P>suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed

<P>shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.

<P>On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint

<P>lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this

<P>vision of the Evening Star.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a
polar winter

<P>sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close

<P>serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the

<P>foreground, a head,- a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg,

<P>and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and

<P>supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a

<P>brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed,

<P>blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were

<P>visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black

<P>drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a

<P>ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.

<P>This pale crescent was 'the likeness of a kingly crown'; what it

<P>diademed was 'the shape which shape had none.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Were you happy when you painted these pictures?' asked
Mr.

<P>Rochester presently.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them,
in

<P>short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account,
have

<P>been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's

<P>dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you

<P>sit at them long each day?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation,
and I sat

<P>at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length

<P>of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent

<P>labours?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my
idea and

<P>my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was

<P>quite powerless to realise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought;
but no

<P>more, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science

<P>to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl,

<P>peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the

<P>Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them

<P>look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above

<P>quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And

<P>who taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and
on

<P>this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There!

<P>put the drawings away!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking
at

<P>his watch, he said abruptly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to
let Adele

<P>sit up so long? Take her to bed!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured
the

<P>caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have

<P>done, nor so much.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish you all good-night, now,' said he, making a movement
of the

<P>hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company,

<P>and wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I

<P>took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in

<P>return, and so withdrew.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs.
Fairfax,'

<P>I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to

<P>bed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, is he?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am
so

<P>accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has

<P>peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Partly because it is his nature- and we can none of us
help our

<P>nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to

<P>harass him, and make his spirits unequal.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What about?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Family troubles, for one thing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But he has no family.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not now, but he has had- or, at least, relatives. He lost
his

<P>elder brother a few years since.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His elder brother?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long
in

<P>possession of the property; only about nine years.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of
his brother

<P>as to be still inconsolable for his loss?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, no- perhaps not. I believe there were some

<P>misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite

<P>just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against

<P>him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the

<P>family estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by

<P>division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth,

<P>too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was
of

<P>age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a

<P>great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined

<P>to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for

<P>the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that

<P>position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what

<P>he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his

<P>family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life.
I

<P>don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight

<P>together, since the death of his brother without a will left him

<P>master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why should he shun it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer;

<P>but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit

<P>information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. She

<P>averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was

<P>chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me
to

<P>drop the subject, which I did accordingly.
