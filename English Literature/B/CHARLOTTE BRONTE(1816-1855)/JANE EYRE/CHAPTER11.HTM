CHAPTER XI</FONT></B>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A NEW chapter in a novel is something like a new scene
in a play;

<P>and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you

<P>see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured

<P>papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such

<P>furniture, such ornaments on the mantel-piece, such prints,

<P>including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince
of

<P>Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible

<P>to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by

<P>that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet;
my

<P>muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness

<P>and chill contracted by sixteen hours' exposure to the rawness of an

<P>October day: I left Lowton at four o'clock A.M., and the Millcote town

<P>clock is now just striking eight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not
very

<P>tranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would

<P>be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the

<P>wooden steps the 'boots' placed for my convenience, expecting to

<P>hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage

<P>waiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible;

<P>and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a

<P>Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but
to

<P>request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting,

<P>while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to
feel

<P>itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection,

<P>uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and

<P>prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.

<P>The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride

<P>warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me

<P>became predominant when half an hour elapsed and still I was alone.

<P>I bethought myself to ring the bell.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?'
I asked

<P>of the waiter who answered the summons.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thornfield? I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar.'
He

<P>vanished, but reappeared instantly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is your name Eyre, Miss?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Person here waiting for you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into
the

<P>inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the

<P>lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This will be your luggage, I suppose?' said the man rather

<P>abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.' He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort
of car,

<P>and then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was
to

<P>Thornfield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A matter of six miles.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long shall we be before we get there?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Happen an hour and a half.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside,
and we

<P>set off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to

<P>reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my

<P>journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant

<P>conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose,' thought I, 'judging from the plainness of
the

<P>servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so

<P>much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was

<P>very miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this

<P>little girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall

<P>surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity

<P>that doing one's best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I

<P>took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with

<P>Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray

<P>God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does,

<P>I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I

<P>can advertise again. How far are we on our road now, I wonder?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind
us;

<P>judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable

<P>magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could

<P>see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the

<P>district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more

<P>populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let
his horse

<P>walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily

<P>believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its
low broad

<P>tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a

<P>narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or

<P>hamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair

<P>of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now

<P>slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house:

<P>candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were

<P>dark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a

<P>maid-servant; I alighted and went in.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you walk this way, ma'am?' said the girl; and I followed

<P>her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me

<P>into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first

<P>dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes

<P>had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and

<P>agreeable picture presented itself to my view.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an
arm-chair

<P>high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable

<P>little elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin

<P>apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately

<P>and milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat

<P>demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the

<P>beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a

<P>new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to

<P>overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the

<P>old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious
ride;

<P>John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?' said I.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, you are right: do sit down.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove
my

<P>shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself

<P>so much trouble.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, it is no trouble; I daresay your own hands are almost
numbed

<P>with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two:

<P>here are the keys of the storeroom.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch
of

<P>keys, and delivered them to the servant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,' she continued. 'You've

<P>brought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, ma'am.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll see it carried into your room,' she said, and bustled
out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She treats me like a visitor,' thought I. 'I little expected

<P>such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is

<P>not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must

<P>not exult too soon.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus
and

<P>a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now

<P>brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather

<P>confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever

<P>before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but

<P>as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out

<P>of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?'
I

<P>asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,' returned
the

<P>good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I repeated the question more distinctly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the
name of your

<P>future pupil.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,- I have no family.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in
what way

<P>Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not

<P>polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am so glad,' she continued, as she sat down opposite
to me,

<P>and took the cat on her knee; 'I am so glad you are come; it will be

<P>quite pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is

<P>pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather

<P>neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable

<P>place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the

<P>best quarters. I say alone- Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John

<P>and his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only

<P>servants, and one can't converse with them on terms of equality: one

<P>must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one's authority.

<P>I'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect,

<P>and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but

<P>the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till

<P>February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after

<P>night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't

<P>think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In

<P>spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make

<P>such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this

<P>autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a

<P>house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her
talk;

<P>and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere

<P>wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,' said
she; 'it

<P>is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all

<P>day: you must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed,

<P>I'll show you your bedroom. I've had the room next to mine prepared

<P>for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like
it

<P>better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have

<P>finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep
in

<P>them myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really
felt

<P>fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She

<P>took her candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to

<P>see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock,

<P>she led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the

<P>staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery

<P>into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a

<P>church rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded

<P>the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and

<P>solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to

<P>find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and
I had

<P>fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced

<P>the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious

<P>staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my

<P>little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and

<P>mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of

<P>gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and

<P>offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose,

<P>to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the

<P>kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned. My

<P>couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears. At

<P>once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it

<P>was broad day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as
the sun

<P>shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing

<P>papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and

<P>stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals

<P>have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of

<P>life was beginning for me- one that was to have its flowers and

<P>pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by

<P>the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all

<P>astir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was

<P>something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an

<P>indefinite future period.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain-
for I

<P>had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity-

<P>I was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to
be

<P>disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on

<P>the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to

<P>please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes

<P>regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy

<P>cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall,

<P>stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that
I

<P>was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked.

<P>And why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be

<P>difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet

<P>I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when I had

<P>brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock- which,

<P>Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety-

<P>and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do

<P>respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new

<P>pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having

<P>opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and

<P>neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the
slippery

<P>steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I

<P>looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a

<P>grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl

<P>necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock

<P>whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and

<P>rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then

<P>I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was

<P>half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine

<P>autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and

<P>still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed

<P>the front of the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions

<P>not vast, though considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a

<P>nobleman's seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.

<P>Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery,

<P>whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and

<P>grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated

<P>by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong,

<P>knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the

<P>mansion's designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those

<P>round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from

<P>the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming

<P>to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find

<P>existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet,

<P>whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of

<P>these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its

<P>old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh
air, yet

<P>listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the

<P>wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it

<P>was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that

<P>lady appeared at the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! out already?' said she. 'I see you are an early
riser.' I

<P>went up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the

<P>hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you like Thornfield?' she asked. I told her I liked
it very

<P>much.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' she said, 'it is a pretty place; but I fear it will
be

<P>getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his

<P>head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it

<P>rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence

<P>of the proprietor.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester!' I exclaimed. 'Who is he?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The owner of Thornfield,' she responded quietly. 'Did
you not know

<P>he was called Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I did not- I had never heard of him before; but
the old

<P>lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood

<P>fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought,' I continued, 'Thornfield belonged to you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only
the

<P>housekeeper- the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the

<P>Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was

<P>a clergyman, incumbent of Hay- that little village yonder on the hill-

<P>and that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester's

<P>mother was a Fairfax, second cousin to my husband: but I never presume

<P>on the connection- in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself

<P>quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always

<P>civil, and I expect nothing more.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the little girl- my pupil!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find
a

<P>believe. Here she comes, with her "bonne," as she calls her nurse.'

<P>The enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow

<P>was no great dame; but a dependant like myself. I did not like her the

<P>worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.

<P>The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of

<P>condescension on her part: so much the better- my position was all the

<P>freer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed
by

<P>her attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did

<P>not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven

<P>or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured

<P>face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good morning, Miss Adela,' said Mrs. Fairfax. 'Come and
speak to

<P>the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some

<P>day.' She approached.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'C'est la ma gouvernante!' said she, pointing to me, and
addressing

<P>her nurse; who answered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mais oui, certainement.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are they foreigners?' I inquired, amazed at hearing the
French

<P>language.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent;

<P>and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she

<P>first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift

<P>to talk it a little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with

<P>French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I daresay.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French
by a

<P>French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with

<P>Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last

<P>seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily- applying

<P>myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as

<P>possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain

<P>degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not

<P>likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and

<P>shook hands with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as

<P>I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her

<P>own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated

<P>at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her

<P>large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah!' cried she, in French, 'you speak my language as well
as Mr.

<P>Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can

<P>Sophie. She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame

<P>Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over

<P>the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked- how it did smoke!-

<P>and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr.

<P>Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and

<P>Sophie and I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of

<P>mine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle- what is your name?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eyre- Jane Eyre.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in
the morning,

<P>before it was quite daylight, at a great city- a huge city, with

<P>very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean

<P>town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a

<P>plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach,

<P>which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and

<P>finer, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie

<P>used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called

<P>the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond

<P>with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?' asked
Mrs.

<P>Fairfax.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to
the fluent

<P>tongue of Madame Pierrot.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish,' continued the good lady, 'you would ask her a
question or

<P>two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele,' I inquired, 'with whom did you live when you were
in

<P>that pretty clean town you spoke of?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy
Virgin.

<P>Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great

<P>many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before

<P>them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I

<P>let you hear me sing now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give
a

<P>specimen of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came

<P>and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely

<P>before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the

<P>ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the

<P>strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her

<P>lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in

<P>her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false

<P>one that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her

<P>demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer;
but I

<P>suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love

<P>and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste

<P>that point was: at least I thought so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the
naivete of

<P>her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, 'Now,

<P>Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming an attitude, she began 'La Ligue des Rats: fable
de La

<P>Fontaine.' She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to

<P>punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an

<P>appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and

<P>which proved she had been carefully trained.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was it your mama who taught you that piece?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: "Qu'avez
vous

<P>donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!" She made me lift my hand- so-

<P>to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance

<P>for you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy
Virgin,

<P>as you say, with whom did you live then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of
me, but she

<P>is nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine

<P>a house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I

<P>would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I

<P>knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always

<P>kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not

<P>kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone

<P>back again himself, and I never see him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which
room,

<P>it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the

<P>schoolroom. Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but

<P>there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be

<P>needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light

<P>literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, etc. I suppose

<P>he had considered that these were all the governess would require

<P>for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for

<P>the present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been

<P>able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of

<P>entertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a

<P>cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for

<P>painting and a pair of globes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined
to

<P>apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt

<P>it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I

<P>had talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and

<P>when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to

<P>her nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in

<P>drawing some little sketches for her use.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils,
Mrs.

<P>Fairfax called to me: 'Your morning school-hours are over now, I

<P>suppose,' said she. She was in a room the folding doors of which stood

<P>open: I went in when she addressed me. It was a large, stately

<P>apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet,

<P>walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass, and a

<P>lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of

<P>fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a beautiful room!' I exclaimed, as I looked round;
for I

<P>had never before seen any half so imposing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window,
to

<P>let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in

<P>apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels

<P>like a vault.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window,
and hung

<P>like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by

<P>two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse

<P>of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view

<P>beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it

<P>a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid

<P>brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of

<P>white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast

<P>crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian

<P>mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between

<P>the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and

<P>fire.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!' said
I. 'No

<P>dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would

<P>think they were inhabited daily.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are
rare,

<P>they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put

<P>him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of

<P>arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in

<P>readiness.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and
habits,

<P>and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like him? Is he generally liked?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost
all

<P>the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged
to

<P>the Rochesters time out of mind.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you
like

<P>him? Is he liked for himself?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe
he is

<P>considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has

<P>never lived much amongst them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather

<P>peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great

<P>deal of the world, I should think. I daresay he is clever, but I never

<P>had much conversation with him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In what way is he peculiar?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know- it is not easy to describe- nothing striking,
but

<P>you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether

<P>he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you

<P>don't thoroughly understand him, in short- at least, I don't: but it

<P>is of no consequence, he is a very good master.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her
employer

<P>and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a

<P>character, or observing and describing salient points, either in

<P>persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class;

<P>my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr.

<P>Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor- nothing more:

<P>she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my

<P>wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When we left the dining-room she proposed to show me over
the

<P>rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs,

<P>admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The

<P>large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the

<P>third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their

<P>air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower

<P>apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions

<P>changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement

<P>showed bed-steads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut,

<P>looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs'

<P>heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,

<P>high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose

<P>cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced

<P>embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been

<P>coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield

<P>Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the

<P>hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I
by

<P>no means coveted a night's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:

<P>shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought

<P>old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of

<P>strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,-

<P>all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of

<P>moonlight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do the servants sleep in these rooms?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back;
no

<P>one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost

<P>at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So I think: you have no ghost, then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None that I ever heard of,' returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have
been

<P>rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though,

<P>that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- "after life's fitful fever they sleep well,"' I muttered.

<P>'Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?' for she was moving away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?'
I

<P>followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence

<P>by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now

<P>on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.

<P>Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the

<P>grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely

<P>girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park,

<P>dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a

<P>path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with

<P>foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all

<P>reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon bounded by a

<P>propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the

<P>scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from it

<P>and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the

<P>ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of

<P>blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of

<P>grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre,

<P>and over which I had been gazing with delight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door;
I,

<P>by dint of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded

<P>to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage

<P>to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third

<P>storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far

<P>end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut,

<P>like a corridor in some Bluebeard's castle.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear
in so

<P>still a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh;

<P>distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for

<P>an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct,

<P>it was very low. It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake

<P>an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one,

<P>and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax!' I called out: for I now heard her descending
the

<P>great stairs. 'Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some of the servants, very likely,' she answered: 'perhaps
Grace

<P>Poole.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you hear it?' I again inquired.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these
rooms.

<P>Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated
in

<P>an odd murmur.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Grace!' exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh
was as

<P>tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that
it

<P>was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the

<P>curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear,

<P>I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed

<P>me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,- a
woman of

<P>between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and

<P>with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less

<P>ghostly could scarcely be conceived.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Too much noise, Grace,' said Mrs. Fairfax. 'Remember

<P>directions!' Grace curtseyed silently and went in.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her

<P>housemaid's work,' continued the widow; 'not altogether

<P>unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough. By the

<P>bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till
we reached

<P>the light and cheerful region below. Adele came running to meet us

<P>in the hall, exclaiming-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mesdames, vous etes servies!' adding, 'J'ai bien faim,
moi!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's
room.
