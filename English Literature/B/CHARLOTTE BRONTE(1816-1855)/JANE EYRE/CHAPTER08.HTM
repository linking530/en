<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ERE the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was
dismissed,

<P>and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to

<P>descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the

<P>floor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to

<P>dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief

<P>that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I

<P>wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself
I

<P>abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be

<P>so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn

<P>respect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress; that

<P>very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had

<P>praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had

<P>promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I

<P>continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I

<P>was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those
of

<P>my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and

<P>trodden on; and could I ever rise more?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never,' I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While
sobbing out

<P>this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up-

<P>again Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming

<P>up the long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, eat something,' she said; but I put both away from
me,

<P>feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present

<P>condition. Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not

<P>now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep

<P>aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her

<P>arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained

<P>silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes
to be a

<P>liar?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who
have

<P>heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know,
despise

<P>me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school
either

<P>despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great
and

<P>admired man; he is little liked here; he never took steps to make

<P>himself liked. Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you

<P>would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it

<P>is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared.

<P>Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but

<P>friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you

<P>persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much

<P>the more evidently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane'-

<P>she paused.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Helen?' said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed
my

<P>fingers gently to warm them, and went on-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while
your

<P>own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would

<P>not be without friends.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is
not

<P>enough: if others don't love me I would rather die than live- I cannot

<P>bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real

<P>affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love,

<P>I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to

<P>let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it

<P>dash its hoof at my chest-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings;
you

<P>are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created

<P>your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other

<P>resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.

<P>Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible

<P>world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is

<P>everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to

<P>guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us
on

<P>all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise

<P>our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge

<P>which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at secondhand

<P>from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and
on

<P>your clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from

<P>flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink

<P>overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is

<P>so certain an entrance to happiness- to glory?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity
she

<P>imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the

<P>impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came;

<P>and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed

<P>a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague

<P>concern for her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round
her waist;

<P>she drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long

<P>thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the

<P>sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming

<P>in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching

<P>figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,' said she; 'I
want you

<P>in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had
to

<P>thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we

<P>reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked

<P>cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair

<P>on one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she called me

<P>to her side.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it all over?' she asked, looking down at my face. 'Have
you

<P>cried your grief away?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am afraid I never shall do that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and
everybody

<P>else, will now think me wicked.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.

<P>Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I, Miss Temple?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will,' said she, passing her arm round me. 'And now
tell me

<P>who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and he left
me to

<P>her care.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle,
as I have

<P>often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that

<P>she would always keep me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you,
that when a

<P>criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.

<P>You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well
as

<P>you can. Say whatever your memory suggests as true; but add nothing

<P>and exaggerate nothing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most

<P>moderate- most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order

<P>to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of

<P>my sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued

<P>than it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful
of

<P>Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused

<P>into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus

<P>restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I

<P>went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as
having

<P>come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful

<P>episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure,

<P>in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my

<P>recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed

<P>spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time

<P>in the dark and haunted chamber.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in
silence;

<P>she then said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if
his

<P>reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from

<P>every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where
I was well

<P>contented to stand for I derived a child's pleasure from the

<P>contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her

<P>white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark

<P>eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the pain in your chest?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a little better.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse;
then

<P>she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.

<P>She was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said

<P>cheerfully-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you
as such.'

<P>She rang her bell.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Barbara,' she said to the servant who answered it, 'I
have not yet

<P>had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did
the

<P>china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table

<P>near the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the

<P>scent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was

<P>beginning to be hungry), discerned only a very small portion: Miss

<P>Temple discerned it too.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Barbara,' said she, 'can you not bring a little more bread
and

<P>butter? There is not enough for three.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbara went out: she returned soon-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman
after Mr.

<P>Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and

<P>iron.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, very well!' returned Miss Temple; 'we must make it
do,

<P>Barbara, I suppose.' And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling,

<P>'Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this

<P>once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and
placed

<P>before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of

<P>toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel

<P>wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized

<P>seed-cake.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I meant to give each of you some of this to take with
you,' said

<P>she, 'but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,' and

<P>she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and
not the

<P>least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with

<P>which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished

<P>appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to
the fire;

<P>we sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed

<P>between her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be

<P>admitted to hear.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air,
of state

<P>in her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded

<P>deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which

<P>chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,

<P>by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as

<P>to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and

<P>kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all

<P>these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers

<P>within her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the

<P>bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but

<P>pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her

<P>eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that

<P>of Miss Temple's- a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash,

<P>nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her

<P>soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot

<P>tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough,
to

<P>hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the

<P>characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening;

<P>her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much

<P>as many live during a protracted existence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations
and times

<P>past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or

<P>guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores

<P>of knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with

<P>French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax

<P>when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to

<P>recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a

<P>shelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen

<P>obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line. She

<P>had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could

<P>be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to

<P>her heart-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God bless you, my children!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go
more

<P>reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her

<P>she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from

<P>her cheek.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd:

<P>she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's,

<P>and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told

<P>that to-morrow she should have half a dozen of untidily folded

<P>articles pinned to her shoulder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My things were indeed in shameful disorder,' murmured
Helen to me,

<P>in a low voice: 'I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters
on a

<P>piece of pasteboard the word 'Slattern,' and bound it like a

<P>phylactery round Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and

<P>benign-looking forehead. She wore it till evening, patient,

<P>unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The moment Miss

<P>Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it

<P>off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was

<P>incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and

<P>large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of

<P>her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated,
Miss

<P>Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared

<P>that what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple,

<P>having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been

<P>made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most

<P>happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every

<P>imputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and
a

<P>murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set
to work

<P>afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I

<P>toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my

<P>memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise

<P>sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class;
in

<P>less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I

<P>learned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first

<P>cottage (whose walls, by the bye, outrivalled in slope those of the

<P>leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to

<P>bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot

<P>roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont

<P>to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of

<P>ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands:

<P>freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins,

<P>Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering

<P>over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wrens' nests

<P>enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I

<P>examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to

<P>translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot

<P>had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my

<P>satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well has Solomon said- 'Better is a dinner of herbs where
love

<P>is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations
for

<P>Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
