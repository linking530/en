CHAPTER XXXVIII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</FONT></B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I,
the parson

<P>and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went

<P>into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner

<P>and John cleaning the knives, and I said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.'
The

<P>housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic

<P>order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a

<P>remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having

<P>one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently

<P>stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she

<P>did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of

<P>chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang

<P>suspended in air; and for the same space of time John's knives also

<P>had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over

<P>the roast, said only-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you, Miss? Well, for sure!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time after she pursued- 'I seed you go out with
the master,

<P>but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;' and she basted

<P>away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what
Mr.

<P>Edward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was

<P>the cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian

<P>name)- 'I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would

<P>not wait long neither: and he's done right, for aught I know. I wish

<P>you joy, Miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and
Mary this.'

<P>I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more,
I

<P>left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after,

<P>I caught the words-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.'
And

<P>again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and

<P>varry good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may

<P>see that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to
say what I

<P>had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary

<P>approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just

<P>give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and

<P>see me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr. Rochester,
when

<P>I read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for

<P>our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade

<P>over your grave or mine.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never
answered the

<P>letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to

<P>me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to

<P>my marriage. His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.

<P>He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence

<P>ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live

<P>without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?
I

<P>had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and

<P>see her at the school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at

<P>beholding me again moved me much. She looked pale and thin: she said

<P>she was not happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too

<P>strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her age: I

<P>took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more,

<P>but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now

<P>required by another- my husband needed them all. So I sought out a

<P>school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit

<P>of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes. I took care

<P>she should never want for anything that could contribute to her

<P>comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became very happy there,

<P>and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a sound English

<P>education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and when

<P>she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion:

<P>docile, good-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful

<P>attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any little

<P>kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience
of

<P>married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose

<P>names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have

<P>done.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to
live

<P>entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself

<P>supremely blest- blest beyond what language can express; because I

<P>am my husband's life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever

<P>nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone

<P>and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society:
he

<P>knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the

<P>heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever

<P>together. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in

<P>solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to

<P>talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All

<P>my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me;

<P>we are precisely suited in character-perfect concord is the result.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our
union:

<P>perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near- that

<P>knit us so very close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his

<P>right hand. Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of

<P>his eye. He saw nature- he saw books through me; and never did I weary

<P>of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of

<P>field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam- of the landscape before

<P>us; of the weather round us- and impressing by sound on his ear what

<P>light could no longer stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading

<P>to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go:

<P>of doing for him what he wished to be done. And there was a pleasure

<P>in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad- because
he

<P>claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation.

<P>He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my

<P>attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that

<P>attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing
a

<P>letter to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a gold watch-chain: I answered 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And have you a pale-blue dress on?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied
the

<P>obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he

<P>was sure of it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent

<P>oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He

<P>cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he

<P>can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer
a

<P>blank to him- the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was

<P>put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own

<P>eyes, as they once were- large, brilliant, and black. On that

<P>occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had

<P>tempered judgment with mercy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because
those we

<P>most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both

<P>married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we

<P>go to see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant

<P>officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her

<P>brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the

<P>connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives,

<P>and are loved by them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.
He

<P>entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.

<P>A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks

<P>and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal,

<P>and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to

<P>improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and

<P>caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may
be

<P>ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who

<P>guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the

<P>exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says-

<P>'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his

<P>cross and follow me.' His is the ambition of the high master-spirit,

<P>which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed

<P>from the earth- who stand without fault before the throne of God,

<P>who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and

<P>chosen, and faithful.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself
has

<P>hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close:

<P>his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received

<P>from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with

<P>divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.
I

<P>know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the

<P>good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of

<P>his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St.

<P>John's last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be

<P>undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words

<P>are a pledge of this-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My Master,' he says, 'has forewarned me. Daily He announces
more

<P>distinctly,- "Surely I come quickly!" and hourly I more eagerly

<P>respond,- "Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!"'
