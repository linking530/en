<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; HITHERTO I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant

<P>existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as

<P>many chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am

<P>only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess

<P>some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years

<P>almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links

<P>of connection.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation
at

<P>Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its

<P>virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention

<P>on the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and
by

<P>degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a

<P>high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and

<P>quality of the children's food; the brackish, fetid water used in

<P>its preparation; the pupils' wretched clothing and accommodations- all

<P>these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result

<P>mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county
subscribed

<P>largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better

<P>situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and

<P>clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the

<P>management of a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth

<P>and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the

<P>post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties

<P>by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his

<P>office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to

<P>combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion

<P>with uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly

<P>useful and noble institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after

<P>its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher;

<P>and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and

<P>importance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy,

<P>because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education

<P>placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a

<P>desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my

<P>teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself

<P>fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first

<P>girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of

<P>teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end
of

<P>that time I altered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued

<P>superintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best

<P>part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my

<P>continual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother,

<P>governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married,

<P>removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy

<P>of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her
was gone

<P>every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in

<P>some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her

<P>nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed

<P>better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had

<P>given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was

<P>content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a

<P>disciplined and subdued character.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came
between

<P>me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a

<P>post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise

<P>mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my

<P>own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the

<P>half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined
myself only

<P>to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my

<P>reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the

<P>afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned

<P>on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming

<P>process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss

<P>Temple- or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere

<P>I had been breathing in her vicinity- and that now I was left in my

<P>natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.

<P>It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive

<P>were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me,

<P>but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some

<P>years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems;

<P>now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field

<P>of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who

<P>had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of

<P>life amidst its perils.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were
the

<P>two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts

<P>of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other

<P>objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I

<P>longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed

<P>prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the

<P>base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I

<P>longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had

<P>travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill

<P>at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought

<P>me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had

<P>all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to

<P>Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit

<P>me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer

<P>world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and

<P>voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and

<P>antipathies- such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that
it

<P>was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one

<P>afternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I

<P>uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly

<P>blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change,

<P>stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space:

<P>'Then,' I cried, half desperate, 'grant me at least a new servitude!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections

<P>till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me

<P>kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged

<P>effusion of small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It

<P>seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered

<P>my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise

<P>for my relief.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welsh-woman,
and till

<P>now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any

<P>other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes

<P>with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my

<P>half-effaced thought instantly revived.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A new servitude! There is something in that,' I soliloquised

<P>(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). 'I know there

<P>is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words

<P>as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no

<P>more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere

<P>waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter
of

<P>fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I

<P>want is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is

<P>not the thing feasible? Yes- yes- the end is not so difficult; if I

<P>had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining

<P>it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it
was a chilly

<P>night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to

<P>think again with all my might.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new
faces,

<P>under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting

<P>anything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to

<P>friends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who

<P>have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own

<P>helpers; and what is their resource?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my
brain to

<P>find a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt

<P>the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it

<P>worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain

<P>labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain,

<P>noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required

<P>suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and

<P>naturally to my mind:- 'Those who want situations advertise; you

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How? I know nothing about advertising.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Replies rose smooth and prompt now:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay
for it

<P>under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it,

<P>the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers

<P>must be addressed to J. E., at the post-office there; you can go and

<P>inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come,

<P>and act accordingly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested
in my

<P>mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell

<P>asleep.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written,

<P>enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it

<P>ran thus:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A young lady accustomed to tuition' (had I not been a
teacher

<P>two years?) 'is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private

<P>family where the children are under fourteen' (I thought that as I was

<P>barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils

<P>nearer my own age). 'She is qualified to teach the usual branches of
a

<P>good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music'

<P>(in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of

<P>accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after
tea, I

<P>asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to

<P>perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my

<P>fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk

<P>of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long;
I

<P>visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and

<P>came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a

<P>relieved heart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last,

<P>however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close

<P>of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to

<P>Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side

<P>of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that

<P>day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting

<P>me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of

<P>lea and water.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured
for a

<P>pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was

<P>done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the

<P>shoemaker's to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore

<P>horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are there any letters for J. E.?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened
a

<P>drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that
my

<P>hopes began to falter. At last, having held a document before her

<P>glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the

<P>counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful

<P>glance- it was for J. E.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there only one?' I demanded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There are no more,' said she; and I put it in my pocket
and turned

<P>my face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be

<P>back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Various duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with
the

<P>girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers;

<P>to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.

<P>Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss

<P>Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our

<P>candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all

<P>burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten

<P>produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had

<P>finished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now

<P>took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the

<P>contents were brief.

<P>Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a

<P>position to give satisfactory references as to character and

<P>competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one

<P>pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary

<P>is thirty pounds per annum. J. E. is requested to send references,

<P>name, address, and all particulars to the direction:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned
and

<P>rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance

<P>was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting

<P>for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into

<P>some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my

<P>endeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle. I now felt that an

<P>elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs.

<P>Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps,

<P>but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.

<P>Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly

<P>spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a

<P>recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it; both the shire and

<P>county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I

<P>longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large

<P>doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least.

<P>Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and

<P>clouds of smoke- 'but,' I argued, 'Thornfield will, probably, be a

<P>good way from the town.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went
out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no
longer be

<P>confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve

<P>their success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the

<P>superintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a

<P>prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double

<P>what I now received (for at Lowood I only got L15 per annum); and

<P>requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or

<P>some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to

<P>mention them as references. She obligingly consented to act as

<P>mediatrix in the matter. The next day she laid the affair before Mr.

<P>Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was

<P>my natural guardian. A note was accordingly addressed to that lady,

<P>who returned for answer, that 'I might do as I pleased: she had long

<P>relinquished all interference in my affairs.' This note went the round

<P>of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most

<P>tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I

<P>could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself

<P>well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character

<P>and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should

<P>forthwith be furnished me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month,
forwarded

<P>a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating

<P>that she was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period

<P>for my assuming the post of governess in her house.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed

<P>rapidly. I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to
my

<P>wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,- the same I had

<P>brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half an hour
the carrier

<P>was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to

<P>repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had

<P>brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves,

<P>and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left

<P>behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to

<P>rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not

<P>now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life

<P>was closing tonight, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to

<P>slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change

<P>was being accomplished.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss,' said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I
was

<P>wandering like a troubled spirit, 'a person below wishes to see you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The carrier, no doubt,' I thought, and ran downstairs
without

<P>inquiry. I was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the

<P>door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran

<P>out-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's her, I am sure!- I could have told her anywhere!'
cried the

<P>individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant,

<P>matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and

<P>eyes, and lively complexion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, who is it?' she asked, in a voice and with a smile
I half

<P>recognised; 'you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously:

<P>'Bessie! Bessie! Bessie!' that was all I said; whereat she half

<P>laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire

<P>stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is my little boy,' said Bessie directly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are married, Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman;
and

<P>I've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you don't live at Gateshead?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about
them,

<P>Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee,

<P>will you?' but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very
stout,'

<P>continued Mrs. Leaven. 'I daresay they've not kept you too well at

<P>school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and

<P>Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama,
and there

<P>everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his

<P>relations were against the match; and- what do you think?- he and Miss

<P>Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.

<P>It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and

<P>now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are

<P>always quarrelling.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, and what of John Reed?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He
went to

<P>college, and he got- plucked, I think they call it: and then his

<P>uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such

<P>a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does he look like?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young
man;

<P>but he has such thick lips.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Mrs. Reed?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I
think

<P>she's not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please

<P>her- he spends a deal of money.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did she send you here, Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when
I heard

<P>that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to

<P>another part of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a

<P>look at you before you were quite out of my reach.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.' I said
this

<P>laughing: I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed

<P>regard, did in no shape denote admiration.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you
look

<P>like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were

<P>no beauty as a child.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct,

<P>but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen

<P>most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an

<P>exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but

<P>gratification.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I daresay you are clever, though,' continued Bessie, by
way of

<P>solace. 'What can you do? Can you play on the piano?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and
then

<P>asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and

<P>she was charmed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The Miss Reeds could not play as well!' said she exultingly.
'I

<P>always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.' It
was a

<P>landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the

<P>superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the

<P>committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture
as any

<P>Miss Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies

<P>themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you can work on muslin and canvas?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would
be: you will

<P>get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something
I

<P>wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father's

<P>kinsfolk, the Eyres?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never in my life.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you know, Missis always said they were poor and
quite

<P>despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much

<P>gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr.

<P>Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were

<P>at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he

<P>could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the

<P>ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite a

<P>gentleman, and I believe he was your father's brother.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine-
the butler

<P>did tell me-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madeira?' I suggested.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, that is it- that is the very word.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So he went?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis
was very

<P>high with him; she called him afterwards a "sneaking tradesman." My

<P>Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very likely,' I returned; 'or perhaps clerk or agent to
a

<P>wine-merchant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer,
and then she

<P>was obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next

<P>morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted

<P>finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there, each went her

<P>separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the

<P>conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the

<P>vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the

<P>unknown environs of Millcote.
