<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MY first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden
age

<P>either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in

<P>habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of

<P>failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical

<P>hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows,
and,

<P>after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our

<P>stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within

<P>these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our

<P>clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had

<P>no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved

<P>hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I

<P>remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause

<P>every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the

<P>swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the

<P>scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of

<P>growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a

<P>delicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an

<P>abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the

<P>famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the

<P>little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between

<P>two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at

<P>teatime; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my

<P>mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment
of

<P>secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had
to walk

<P>two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set

<P>out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we

<P>became almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an

<P>allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion

<P>observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an
exposed and

<P>hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of

<P>snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly
along our

<P>drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,

<P>gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and

<P>example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, 'like

<P>stalwart soldiers.' The other teachers, poor things, were generally

<P>themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire
when we

<P>got back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each

<P>hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row
of

<P>great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in

<P>groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double
ration

<P>of bread- a whole, instead of a half, slice- with the delicious

<P>addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to

<P>which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally

<P>contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but

<P>the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the
Church

<P>Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St.

<P>Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose

<P>irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of

<P>these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some

<P>half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall

<P>down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be

<P>taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the

<P>centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the

<P>sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank

<P>together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors'

<P>high stools.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst;
and

<P>indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the

<P>first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his

<P>friend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not

<P>say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did

<P>at last.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood),
as I was

<P>sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division,

<P>my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure

<P>just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline;

<P>and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose

<P>en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain

<P>whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the

<P>schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,

<P>stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously

<P>from the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this

<P>piece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst,

<P>buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid

<P>than ever.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition;
too

<P>well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my

<P>disposition, etc.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to

<P>apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along
I

<P>had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,- I had been

<P>looking out daily for the 'Coming Man,' whose information respecting

<P>my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever:

<P>now there he was.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in
her ear: I

<P>did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I

<P>watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see

<P>its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I

<P>listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the

<P>room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from

<P>immediate apprehension.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton
will do;

<P>it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico

<P>chemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith

<P>that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she

<P>shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any

<P>account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they

<P>have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma'am!

<P>I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!- when I was here

<P>last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying

<P>on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state
of

<P>repair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not

<P>been well mended from time to time.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your directions shall be attended to, sir,' said Miss
Temple.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And, ma'am,' he continued, 'the laundress tells me some
of the

<P>girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules

<P>limit them to one.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and

<P>Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at

<P>Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers

<P>for the occasion.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the
circumstance

<P>occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I

<P>find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch,

<P>consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls

<P>during the past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations,

<P>and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this

<P>innovation? and by what authority?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,' replied
Miss

<P>Temple: 'the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not

<P>possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till

<P>dinner-time.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan
in bringing

<P>up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and

<P>indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should

<P>any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as

<P>the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish,

<P>the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something

<P>more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and

<P>obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to

<P>the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince

<P>fortitude under the temporary privation. A brief address on those

<P>occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor

<P>would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the

<P>primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the

<P>exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples

<P>to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man

<P>shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out

<P>of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, "If ye suffer

<P>hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye." Oh, madam, when you put

<P>bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's

<P>mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think

<P>how you starve their immortal souls!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst again paused- perhaps overcome by his
feelings.

<P>Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but

<P>she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as

<P>marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that

<P>material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required

<P>a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into

<P>petrified severity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with
his hands

<P>behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly

<P>his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled

<P>or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he

<P>had hitherto used-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what- what is that girl with
curled

<P>hair? Red hair, ma'am, curled- curled all over?' And extending his

<P>cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is Julia Severn,' replied Miss Temple, very quietly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Julia Severn, ma'am! And why has she, or any other, curled
hair?

<P>Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does

<P>she conform to the world so openly- here in an evangelical, charitable

<P>establishment- as to wear her hair one mass of curls?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Julia's hair curls naturally,' returned Miss Temple, still
more

<P>quietly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I
wish

<P>these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I

<P>have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged

<P>closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be

<P>cut off entirely; I will send a barber tomorrow: and I see others

<P>who have far too much of the excrescence- that tall girl, tell her

<P>to turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their

<P>faces to the wall.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if
to

<P>smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the

<P>order, however, and when the first class could take in what was

<P>required of them, they obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I

<P>could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this

<P>manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he

<P>would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside
of

<P>the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference

<P>than he imagined.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some
five

<P>minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell

<P>of doom-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All those top-knots must be cut off.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam,' he pursued, 'I have a Master to serve whose kingdom
is not

<P>of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of

<P>the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and

<P>sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the

<P>young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which

<P>vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off;

<P>think of the time wasted, of-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors,

<P>ladies, now entered the room. They ought to have come a little

<P>sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly

<P>attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine

<P>girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion,

<P>shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful

<P>head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled;

<P>the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with

<P>ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple,
as Mrs.

<P>and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the

<P>top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their

<P>reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the

<P>room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper,

<P>questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now

<P>proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who

<P>was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the

<P>dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other

<P>matters called off and enchained my attention.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst

<P>and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions
to

<P>secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I

<P>could only elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on

<P>the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my

<P>slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped

<P>notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from

<P>my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye

<P>upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up

<P>the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It

<P>came.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A careless girl!' said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately
after-

<P>'It is the new pupil, I perceive.' And before I could draw breath,

<P>'I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.' Then aloud:

<P>how loud it seemed to me! 'Let the child who broke her slate come

<P>forward!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed:
but the

<P>two great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and

<P>pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently

<P>assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall
not

<P>be punished.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,'

<P>thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and

<P>Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fetch that stool,' said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to
a very

<P>high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Place the child upon it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in
no condition

<P>to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to

<P>the height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of

<P>me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a

<P>cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ladies,' said he, turning to his family, 'Miss Temple,
teachers,

<P>and children, you all see this girl?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like

<P>burning-glasses against my scorched skin.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the
ordinary

<P>form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He

<P>has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked

<P>character. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a

<P>servant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pause- in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves,
and

<P>to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer

<P>to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dear children,' pursued the black marble clergyman,
with

<P>pathos, 'this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my

<P>duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs,

<P>is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently
an

<P>interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you

<P>must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her

<P>from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you

<P>must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words,

<P>scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if,

<P>indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I

<P>tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land,

<P>worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and

<P>kneels before Juggernaut- this girl is- a liar!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this
time in

<P>perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts

<P>produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics,

<P>while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two

<P>younger ones whispered, 'How shocking!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and

<P>charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her

<P>own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl

<P>repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her

<P>excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young

<P>ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their

<P>purity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old

<P>sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers,

<P>superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round

<P>her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted
the top

<P>button of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose,

<P>bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state

<P>from the room. Turning at the door, my judge said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her stand half an hour longer on that stool, and let
no one

<P>speak to her during the remainder of the day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could
not

<P>bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the

<P>room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What
my

<P>sensations were, no language can describe; but just as they all

<P>rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up

<P>and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light

<P>inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through

<P>me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had

<P>passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I

<P>mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand

<P>on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight questions about her work

<P>of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned

<P>to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I

<P>remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine

<P>intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her

<P>thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of

<P>an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm 'the untidy

<P>badge;' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss

<P>Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had

<P>blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature
of

<P>man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes

<P>like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind

<P>to the full brightness of the orb.
