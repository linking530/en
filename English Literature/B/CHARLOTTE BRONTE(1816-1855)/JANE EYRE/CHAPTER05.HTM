<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FIVE o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th
of

<P>January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me

<P>already up and nearly dressed. I had risen half an hour before her

<P>entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light

<P>of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow

<P>window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach

<P>which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie was the only person

<P>yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now

<P>proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with

<P>the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in

<P>vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had

<P>prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into

<P>my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping

<P>herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs.

<P>Reed's bedroom, she said, 'Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were
gone down

<P>to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my

<P>cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been

<P>my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her

<P>accordingly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did you say, Miss?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned
from

<P>her to the wall.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That was wrong, Miss Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my
friend:

<P>she has been my foe.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O Miss Jane! don't say so!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-bye to Gateshead!' cried I, as we passed through
the hall and

<P>went out at the front door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried
a lantern,

<P>whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent

<P>thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I

<P>hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter's lodge: when

<P>we reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my

<P>trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded
at

<P>the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that

<P>hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming

<P>coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly

<P>through the gloom.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is she going by herself?' asked the porter's wife.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how far is it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fifty miles.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust
her

<P>so far alone.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four
horses

<P>and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged

<P>haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to

<P>which I clung with kisses.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Be sure and take good care of her,' cried she to the guard,
as

<P>he lifted me into the inside.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ay, ay!' was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice

<P>exclaimed 'All right,' and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie

<P>and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed,

<P>remote and mysterious regions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember but little of the journey; I only know that
the day

<P>seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel

<P>over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and

<P>in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken

<P>out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn,

<P>where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no

<P>appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each

<P>end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery

<P>high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I

<P>walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally

<P>apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed

<P>in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's

<P>fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was

<P>stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned
into

<P>dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from

<P>Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great

<P>grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we

<P>descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had

<P>overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not
long

<P>slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door

<P>was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her

<P>face and dress by the light of the lamps.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?' she asked.
I

<P>answered 'Yes', and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and

<P>the coach instantly drove away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the
noise and

<P>motion of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me.

<P>Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly

<P>discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door

<P>I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There

<P>was now visible a house or houses- for the building spread far- with

<P>many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly

<P>path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led

<P>me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then
I

<P>looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the

<P>hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains,

<P>shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or

<P>splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I

<P>was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when

<P>the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another

<P>followed close behind.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and
a pale and

<P>large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her

<P>countenance was grave, her bearing erect.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The child is very young to be sent alone,' said she, putting
her

<P>candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute

<P>or two, then further added-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are
you

<P>tired?' she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little, ma'am.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before
she goes

<P>to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents

<P>to come to school, my little girl?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired
how long

<P>they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I

<P>could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek

<P>gently with her forefinger, and saying, 'She hoped I should be a

<P>good child,' dismissed me along with Miss Miller.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one
who went

<P>with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her

<P>voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in

<P>complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and

<P>action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she

<P>looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an

<P>under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment,

<P>from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till,

<P>emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that

<P>portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many

<P>voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal

<P>tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and

<P>seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age,

<P>from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their

<P>number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding

<P>eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint

<P>fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they

<P>were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I had

<P>heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door,
then

<P>walking up to the top of the long room she cried out-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going
round,

<P>gathered the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word

<P>of command-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing
a

<P>tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon,

<P>and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The

<P>portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the

<P>water, the mug being common to all. When it came to my turn, I

<P>drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and

<P>fatigue rendering me incapable of eating; I now saw, however, that

<P>it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the
classes

<P>filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with

<P>weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was,

<P>except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I

<P>was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when

<P>laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was

<P>quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was

<P>extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream;
I only

<P>once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall

<P>in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place

<P>by my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing;

<P>the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a

<P>rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was

<P>bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and

<P>washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon,
as

<P>there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle
of

<P>the room. Again the bell rang; all formed in file, two and two, and
in

<P>that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit

<P>schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she

<P>called out-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Form classes!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which
Miss Miller

<P>repeatedly exclaimed, 'Silence!' and 'Order!' When it subsided, I

<P>saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs,

<P>placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a

<P>great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.
A

<P>pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of

<P>numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this

<P>indefinite sound.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered
the

<P>room, each walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed

<P>the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around

<P>which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior

<P>class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Business now began: the day's Collect was repeated, then
certain

<P>texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted

<P>reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time

<P>that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The

<P>indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were

<P>marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I

<P>was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly

<P>sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on
two long

<P>tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay,

<P>sent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation

<P>of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those

<P>destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls

<P>of the first class, rose the whispered words-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Silence!' ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller,
but one

<P>of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed,

<P>but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one

<P>table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain

<P>for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss

<P>Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,

<P>foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards

<P>found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace

<P>was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the

<P>teachers, and the meal began.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or
two of my

<P>portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger

<P>blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge

<P>is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over

<P>it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and

<P>try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.

<P>Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned

<P>for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory

<P>was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and

<P>in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the

<P>porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their

<P>countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one,

<P>whispered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Abominable stuff! How shameful!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began,
during

<P>which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of

<P>time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and

<P>they used their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the

<P>breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the

<P>sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the

<P>room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and

<P>sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by

<P>some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she

<P>made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she

<P>shared in it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left
her circle,

<P>and standing in the middle of the room, cried-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Silence! To your seats!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng
was

<P>resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour

<P>of tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but

<P>still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the

<P>room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage

<P>they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a

<P>curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow

<P>tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped

<P>something like a Highlander's purse) tied in front of their frocks,

<P>and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing

<P>woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles.

<P>Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or

<P>rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even

<P>to the prettiest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining
the

<P>teachers- none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a

<P>little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh

<P>and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,

<P>weather-beaten, and over-worked- when, as my eye wandered from face
to

<P>face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common

<P>spring.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was
puzzled. Ere

<P>I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes

<P>were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and

<P>encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood
at

<P>the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at

<P>each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.

<P>Miss Miller, approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having

<P>received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted
moved

<P>slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of

<P>veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my

<P>eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad day-light, she looked

<P>tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their

<P>irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the

<P>whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a

<P>very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the

<P>fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets

<P>were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple

<P>cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a

<P>gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her

<P>girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features;

<P>a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he

<P>will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea

<P>of the exterior of Miss Temple- Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw

<P>the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having

<P>taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables,

<P>summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on

<P>geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers:

<P>repetitions in history, grammar, etc., went on for an hour; writing

<P>and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss

<P>Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was

<P>measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent

<P>rose-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have a word to address to the pupils,' said she.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking
forth,

<P>but it sank at her voice. She went on-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat;
you must

<P>be hungry:- I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be

<P>served to all.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is to be done on my responsibility,' she added, in
an

<P>explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed,
to

<P>the high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was

<P>now given 'To the garden!' Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with

<P>strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze, I was

<P>similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into

<P>the open air.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden was a wide enclosure, surrounded with walls
so high as

<P>to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down

<P>one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into

<P>scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the

<P>pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers

<P>they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of

<P>January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood

<P>and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not

<P>positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under

<P>foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The

<P>stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but

<P>sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in

<P>the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their

<P>shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to
take

<P>notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of

<P>isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant

<P>against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about

<P>me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the

<P>unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to

<P>the employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too

<P>undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I

<P>was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable

<P>distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could

<P>form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then

<P>up at the house- a large building, half of which seemed grey and

<P>old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom

<P>and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave

<P>it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this

<P>inscription-

<P>Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.' 'Let your light

<P>so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify

<P>your Father which is in heaven.'- St. Matt. v. 16.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I read these words over and over again: I felt that an

<P>explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate

<P>their import. I was still pondering the signification of

<P>'Institution', and endeavouring to make out a connection between the

<P>first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough

<P>close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a

<P>stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which

<P>she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title- it was

<P>Rasselas; a name that struck me as strange, and consequently

<P>attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to

<P>her directly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is your book interesting?' I had already formed the intention
of

<P>asking her to lend it to me some day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like it,' she answered, after a pause of a second or
two, during

<P>which she examined me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is it about?' I continued. I hardly know where I
found the

<P>hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was

<P>contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched
a

<P>chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a

<P>frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the

<P>serious or substantial.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You may look at it,' replied the girl, offering me the
book.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents
were

<P>less taking than the title: Rasselas looked dull to my trifling taste;

<P>I saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety

<P>seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her;

<P>she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about

<P>to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to

<P>disturb her-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the
door

<P>means? What is Lowood Institution?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This house where you are come to live.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way
different

<P>from other schools?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the
rest of

<P>us, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not

<P>either your father or your mother dead?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Both died before I can remember.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both
parents, and

<P>this is called an institution for educating orphans.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for
each.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then why do they call us charity-children?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching,
and

<P>the deficiency is supplied by subscription.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who subscribes?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this

<P>neighbourhood and in London.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The lady who built the new part of this house as that
tablet

<P>records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who
wears a

<P>watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer
to Mr.

<P>Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food

<P>and all our clothes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does he live here?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- two miles off, at a large hall.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is he a good man?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what are the other teachers called?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends
to the

<P>work, and cuts out- for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and

<P>pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss

<P>Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class

<P>repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a

<P>pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is

<P>Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like the teachers?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well enough.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like the little black one, and the Madame-? -I
cannot

<P>pronounce her name as you do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Scatcherd is hasty- you must take care not to offend
her;

<P>Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But Miss Temple is the best- isn't she?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above
the rest,

<P>because she knows far more than they do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you been long here?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Two years.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you an orphan?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My mother is dead.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you happy here?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers
enough

<P>for the present: now I want to read.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all
re-entered

<P>the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely

<P>more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast:

<P>the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a

<P>strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of

<P>indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and

<P>cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was

<P>apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within

<P>myself whether every day's fare would be like this.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom:
lessons

<P>recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw
the girl

<P>with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by

<P>Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle

<P>of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high

<P>degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl- she looked

<P>thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress

<P>and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed:

<P>composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes.

<P>'How can she bear it so quietly- so firmly?' I asked of myself.

<P>'Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open

<P>and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something

<P>beyond her punishment- beyond her situation: of something not round

<P>her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams- is she in a

<P>day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they

<P>do not see it- her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:

<P>she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is

<P>really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is- whether good or

<P>naughty.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of
a small mug

<P>of coffee, and half a slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and

<P>drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much

<P>more- I was still hungry. Half an hour's recreation succeeded, then

<P>study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and

<P>bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.
