<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; HE did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had
said he

<P>would. He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time
he

<P>made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a

<P>conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended

<P>him. Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word he

<P>contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put

<P>beyond the pale of his favour.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness-

<P>not that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully

<P>in his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior

<P>to the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for

<P>saying I scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words;

<P>and as long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his

<P>look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air

<P>between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to

<P>his ear, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called
me as

<P>usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man

<P>within him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure

<P>Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and

<P>speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every

<P>phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly

<P>communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner. To

<P>me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye

<P>was a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument-

<P>nothing more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All this was torture to me- refined, lingering torture.
It kept

<P>up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief,

<P>which harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how- if I were his

<P>wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon

<P>kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or

<P>receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.

<P>Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No

<P>ruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement- no

<P>yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast

<P>falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they

<P>produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a

<P>matter of stone or metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat

<P>kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not

<P>sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned,

<P>he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by

<P>malice, but on principle.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night before he left home, happening to see him walking
in

<P>the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that

<P>this man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that
we

<P>were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain

<P>his friendship. I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over

<P>the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with
me. Let us

<P>be friends.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope we are friends,' was the unmoved reply; while he
still

<P>watched the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I

<P>approached.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know
that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no
ill and

<P>all good.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable
of

<P>wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire

<P>somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy

<P>you extend to mere strangers.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course,' he said. 'Your wish is reasonable, and I am
far from

<P>regarding you as a stranger.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and

<P>baffling enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire,
I

<P>should immediately have left him; but something worked within me

<P>more strongly than those feelings could. I deeply venerated my

<P>cousin's talent and principle. His friendship was of value to me: to

<P>lose it tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the

<P>attempt to reconquer it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to
India, will

<P>you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you
not go to

<P>India?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said I could not unless I married you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people
can put

<P>into the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche

<P>is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their

<P>displeasure?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but
it did

<P>not yet crash down.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once more, why this refusal?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Formerly,' I answered, 'because you did not love me; now,
I reply,

<P>because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me.

<P>You are killing me now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His lips and cheeks turned white- quite white.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should kill you- I am killing you? Your words are such
as

<P>ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray

<P>an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would

<P>seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow

<P>even until seventy-and-seven times.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing
to erase

<P>from his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that

<P>tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it

<P>in.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now you will indeed hate me,' I said. 'It is useless to
attempt to

<P>conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because
they

<P>touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary

<P>spasm. I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You utterly misinterpret my words,' I said, at once seizing
his

<P>hand: 'I have no intention to grieve or pain you- indeed, I have not.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most bitterly he smiled- most decidedly he withdrew his
hand from

<P>mine. 'And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at

<P>all, I presume?' said he, after a considerable pause.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I will, as your assistant,' I answered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was
in him

<P>between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only

<P>singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed

<P>over his face. He spoke at last.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman
of your age

<P>proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you

<P>in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your

<P>ever again alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret-

<P>for your sake.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave
me

<P>courage at once. 'Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on

<P>nonsense. You pretend to be shocked by what I have said. You are not

<P>really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either

<P>so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again,
I

<P>will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled
his

<P>passion perfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit
me. With me,

<P>then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer,
I

<P>will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs
a

<P>coadjutor. Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's

<P>aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your

<P>promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any
formal

<P>promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much

<P>too hard and much too despotic for the occasion. I replied-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion
in the

<P>case. I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India,

<P>especially with strangers. With you I would have ventured much,

<P>because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am

<P>convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live

<P>long in that climate.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! you are afraid of yourself,' he said, curling his
lip.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to
do as

<P>you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to

<P>committing suicide. Moreover, before I definitely resolve on

<P>quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of

<P>greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you mean?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there
is a

<P>point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere

<P>till by some means that doubt is removed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The

<P>interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you

<P>ought to have crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it. You

<P>think of Mr. Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was true. I confessed it by silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must find out what is become of him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It remains for me, then,' he said, 'to remember you in
my prayers,

<P>and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not

<P>indeed become a castaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the

<P>chosen. But God sees not as man sees: His will be done.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away
down the

<P>glen. He was soon out of sight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the
window,

<P>looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I:. she

<P>put her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane,' she said, 'you are always agitated and pale now.
I am

<P>sure there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and

<P>you have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the

<P>window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I

<P>have fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a strange being-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused- I did not speak: soon she resumed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some
sort

<P>respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice

<P>and interest he never showed to any one else- to what end? I wish he

<P>loved you- does he, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; 'No, Die, not one
whit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get
you so

<P>frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?

<P>Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He does- he has asked me to be his wife.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana clapped her hands. 'That is just what we hoped and
thought!

<P>And you will marry him, Jane, won't you? And then he will stay in

<P>England.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me
is to

<P>procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! He wishes you to go to India?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madness!' she exclaimed. 'You would not live three months
there, I

<P>am certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you,

<P>Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have refused to marry him-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And have consequently displeased him?' she suggested.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered
to

<P>accompany him as his sister.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task
you

<P>undertook- one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the

<P>strong, and you are weak. St. John- you know him- would urge you to

<P>impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest

<P>during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he

<P>exacts, you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found

<P>courage to refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not as a husband.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet he is a handsome fellow.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well
as too

<P>good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.' And again she earnestly

<P>conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must indeed,' I said; 'for when just now I repeated
the offer of

<P>serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of

<P>decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in

<P>proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first

<P>hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and
again

<P>explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.
He

<P>has told me I am formed for labour- not for love: which is true, no

<P>doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows

<P>that I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to
be

<P>chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Insupportable- unnatural- out of the question!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And then,' I continued, 'though I have only sisterly affection
for

<P>him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the

<P>possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of

<P>love for him, because he is so talented; and there is often a

<P>certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation. In that

<P>case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me

<P>to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible

<P>that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know

<P>he would.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And yet St. John is a good man,' said Diana.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly,
the

<P>feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.

<P>It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way,

<P>lest, in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I

<P>will leave you, Diana.' And I hastened upstairs as I saw him

<P>entering the garden.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that
meal he

<P>appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly

<P>speak to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his

<P>matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.

<P>He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of

<P>late, been his ordinary manner- one scrupulously polite. No doubt he

<P>had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had

<P>roused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the

<P>twenty-first chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to

<P>listen while from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did

<P>his fine voice sound at once so sweet and full- never did his manner

<P>become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the

<P>oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone-

<P>that manner a more thrilling meaning- as he sat in the midst of his

<P>household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained

<P>window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on

<P>the table): as he sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and

<P>described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new

<P>earth- told how God would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe

<P>away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no

<P>more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because

<P>the former things were passed away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke
them:

<P>especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in

<P>sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will
be his

<P>God, and he shall be my son. But,' was slowly, distinctly read, 'the

<P>fearful, the unbelieving, etc., shall have their part in the lake

<P>which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness,
marked

<P>his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The

<P>reader believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of

<P>life, and he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city

<P>to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which

<P>has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God

<P>lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered-
all

<P>his stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and

<P>resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the

<P>weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even

<P>at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world

<P>and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged,
he

<P>claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness

<P>is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered

<P>at his; then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and

<P>at last awed. He felt the greatness and goodness of his purpose so

<P>sincerely: others who heard him plead for it, could not but feel it

<P>too.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at
a very early

<P>hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the

<P>room- in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I

<P>tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge
in a

<P>fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I

<P>listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage

<P>with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first

<P>aim- to do all things to the glory of God. My Master was

<P>long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a

<P>vessel of wrath: repent- resolve, while there is yet time. Remember,

<P>we are bid to work while it is day- warned that "the night cometh when

<P>no man shall work." Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good

<P>things in this life. God give you strength to choose that better

<P>part which shall not be taken from you!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.
He had

<P>spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover

<P>beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his

<P>wandering sheep- or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul

<P>for which he is responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men
of

<P>feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots-

<P>provided only they be sincere- have their sublime moments, when they

<P>subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John- veneration so

<P>strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long

<P>shunned. I was tempted to cease struggling with him- to rush down

<P>the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose

<P>my own. I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once

<P>before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool both times. To

<P>have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have

<P>yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this

<P>hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time:

<P>I was unconscious of folly at the instant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch. My refusals
were

<P>forgotten- my fears overcome- my wrestlings paralysed. The Impossible-

<P>i.e., my marriage with St. John- was fast becoming the Possible. All

<P>was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion called- Angels

<P>beckoned- God commanded- life rolled together like a scroll- death's

<P>gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety

<P>and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim

<P>room was full of visions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Could you decide now?' asked the missionary. The inquiry
was put

<P>in gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how

<P>far more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John's wrath: I

<P>grew pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time,

<P>if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day,

<P>of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of

<P>solemn prayer: it was only elevated.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could decide if I were but certain,' I answered: 'were
I but

<P>convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to

<P>marry you here and now- come afterwards what would!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My prayers are heard!' ejaculated St. John. He pressed
his hand

<P>firmer on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm,

<P>almost as if he loved me (I say almost- I knew the difference- for I

<P>had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love

<P>out of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my

<P>inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely,

<P>deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. 'Show

<P>me, show me the path!' I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more

<P>than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of

<P>excitement the reader shall judge.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the house was still; for I believe all, except St.
John and

<P>myself, were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the

<P>room was full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard

<P>its throb. Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that

<P>thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.

<P>The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp,

<P>as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost

<P>activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now

<P>summoned and forced to wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited

<P>while the flesh quivered on my bones.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What have you heard? What do you see?' asked St. John.
I saw

<P>nothing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! Jane! Jane!'- nothing more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O God! what is it?' I gasped.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I might have said, 'Where is it?' for it did not seem in
the

<P>room- nor in the house- nor in the garden; it did not come out of

<P>the air- nor from under the earth- nor from overhead. I had heard

<P>it- where, or whence, for ever impossible to know! And it was the

<P>voice of a human being- a known, loved, well-remembered voice- that
of

<P>Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly,

<P>eerily, urgently.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am coming!' I cried. 'Wait for me! Oh, I will come!'
I flew to

<P>the door and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into

<P>the garden: it was void.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you?' I exclaimed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back-
'Where

<P>are you?' I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was

<P>moorland loneliness and midnight hush.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Down superstition!' I commented, as that spectre rose
up black

<P>by the black yew at the gate. 'This is not thy deception, nor thy

<P>witchcraft: it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did- no

<P>miracle- but her best.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have
detained

<P>me. It was my time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and
in

<P>force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to

<P>leave me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there
is

<P>energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to

<P>my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my

<P>way- a different way to St. John's, but effective in its own

<P>fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my

<P>soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the

<P>thanksgiving- took a resolve- and lay down, unscared, enlightened-

<P>eager but for the daylight.
