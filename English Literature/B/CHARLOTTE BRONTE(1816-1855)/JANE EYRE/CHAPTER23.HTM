<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A SPLENDID Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure,
suns so

<P>radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even

<P>singly, our wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had

<P>come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and

<P>lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got

<P>in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads

<P>white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood,

<P>full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of

<P>the cleared meadows between.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries

<P>in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched

<P>her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:- 'Day
its fervid

<P>fires had wasted,' and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched

<P>summit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state- pure of the

<P>pomp of clouds- spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of

<P>red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and

<P>extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.

<P>The east had its own charm of fine deep blue, and its own modest

<P>gem, a rising and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she

<P>was yet beneath the horizon.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known
scent-

<P>that of a cigar- stole from some window; I saw the library casement

<P>open a hand-breadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart

<P>into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more

<P>Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very

<P>high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a

<P>beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk

<P>fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk,

<P>bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut,

<P>circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one could

<P>wander unseen. While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such

<P>gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but

<P>in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the

<P>enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this

<P>more open quarter, my step is stayed-not by sound, not by sight, but

<P>once more by a warning fragrance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have
long

<P>been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is

<P>neither of shrub nor flower; it is- I know it well- it is Mr.

<P>Rochester's cigar. I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with

<P>ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile

<P>off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but that

<P>perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket leading to the

<P>shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy

<P>recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and

<P>if I sit still he will never see me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But no- eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this
antique

<P>garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the

<P>gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with

<P>which they are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now

<P>stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance

<P>or to admire the dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes

<P>humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he

<P>sees it, and bends to examine it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, he has his back towards me,' thought I, 'and he is
occupied

<P>too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly

<P>gravel might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard

<P>or two distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged

<P>him. 'I shall get by very well,' I meditated. As I crossed his shadow,

<P>thrown long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said

<P>quietly, without turning-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, come and look at this fellow.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind- could his
shadow feel?

<P>I started at first, and then I approached him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Look at his wings,' said he, 'he reminds me rather of
a West

<P>Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover

<P>in England; there! he is flown.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also;
but Mr.

<P>Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in
the house;

<P>and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at

<P>meeting with moonrise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes
prompt

<P>enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing

<P>an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile

<P>word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful

<P>embarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.

<P>Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to

<P>allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts

<P>busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself

<P>looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling

<P>any confusion: the evil- if evil existent or prospective there was-

<P>seemed to lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane,' he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk,
and slowly

<P>strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the

<P>horse-chestnut, 'Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must have become in some degree attached to the house,-
you,

<P>who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ

<P>of Adhesiveness?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am attached to it, indeed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you
have

<P>acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele,

<P>too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And would be sorry to part with them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pity!' he said, and sighed and paused. 'It is always the
way of

<P>events in this life,' he continued presently: 'no sooner have you

<P>got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you

<P>to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Must I move on, sir?' I asked. 'Must I leave Thornfield?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe

<P>indeed you must.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is come now- I must give it to-night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are going to be married, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ex-act-ly- pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you
have hit

<P>the nail straight on the head.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Soon, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very soon, my- that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember,
Jane,

<P>the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my

<P>intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to

<P>enter into the holy estate of matrimony- to take Miss Ingram to my

<P>bosom, in short (she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the

<P>point- one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my

<P>beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying- listen to me, Jane!

<P>You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you? That

<P>was only a lady-clock, child, "flying away home." I wish to remind you

<P>that it was you who first said to me, with that discretion I respect

<P>in you- with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your

<P>responsible and dependent position- that in case I married Miss

<P>Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot forthwith. I pass

<P>over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character

<P>of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll try to

<P>forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have

<P>made it my law of action. Adele must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre,

<P>must get a new situation.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime,
I

<P>suppose-' I was going to say, 'I suppose I may stay here, till I

<P>find another shelter to betake myself to': but I stopped, feeling it

<P>would not do to risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under

<P>command.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,' continued
Mr.

<P>Rochester; 'and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment

<P>and an asylum for you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependant
does

<P>her duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim

<P>upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render

<P>her; indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard

<P>of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education
of

<P>the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge,

<P>Connaught, Ireland. You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such

<P>warmhearted people there, they say.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a long way off, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No matter- a girl of your sense will not object to the
voyage or

<P>the distance.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is
a barrier-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From what, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From England and from Thornfield: and-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From you, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction
of

<P>free will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard,

<P>however; I avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and

<P>Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of

<P>all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and

<P>the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the remembrance

<P>of the wider ocean- wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and

<P>what I naturally and inevitably loved.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a long way,' I again said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge,

<P>Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's

<P>morally certain. I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much
of

<P>a fancy for the country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we

<P>not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like
to

<P>spend the little time that remains to them close to each other.

<P>Come! we'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half an

<P>hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven

<P>yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.

<P>Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more

<P>be destined to sit there together.' He seated me and himself.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to
send my

<P>little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how

<P>is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was
still.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because,' he said, 'I sometimes have a queer feeling with
regard

<P>to you- especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a

<P>string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably

<P>knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of

<P>your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel and two hundred

<P>miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of

<P>communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should

<P>take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,- you'd forget me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I never should, sir: you know-' Impossible to proceed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?
Listen!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress
what I

<P>endured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from

<P>head to foot with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to

<P>express an impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come
to

<P>Thornfield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you are sorry to leave it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within
me,

<P>was claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a

<P>right to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last:

<P>yes,- and to speak.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:- I love
it,

<P>because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,- momentarily
at

<P>least. I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I

<P>have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every

<P>glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I

<P>have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I

<P>delight in,- with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have

<P>known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish
to

<P>feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the

<P>necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of

<P>death.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where do you see the necessity?' he asked suddenly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In what shape?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,-
your

<P>bride.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My bride! What bride? I have no bride!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you will have.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes;- I will!'- I will!' He set his teeth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I must go:- you have said it yourself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: you must stay! I swear it- and the oath shall be kept.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I tell you I must go!' I retorted, roused to something
like

<P>passion. 'Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you

<P>think I am an automaton?- a machine without feelings? and can bear

<P>to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of

<P>living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor,

<P>obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think

<P>wrong!- I have as much soul as you,- and full as much heart! And if

<P>God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made

<P>it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I
am

<P>not talking to you now through the medium of custom,

<P>conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;- it is my spirit that

<P>addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave,

<P>and we stood at God's feet, equal,- as we are!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As we are!' repeated Mr. Rochester- 'so,' he added, enclosing
me

<P>in his arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips:

<P>'so, Jane!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, so, sir,' I rejoined: 'and yet not so; for you are
a

<P>married man- or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to

<P>you- to one with whom you have no sympathy- whom I do not believe

<P>you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would

<P>scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you- let me go!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where, Jane? To Ireland?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere
now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic
bird that

<P>is rending its own plumage in its desperation.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human
being with

<P>an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before
him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And your will shall decide your destiny,' he said: 'I
offer you my

<P>hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I ask you to pass through life at my side- to be my second
self,

<P>and best earthly companion.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For that fate you have already made your choice, and must
abide by

<P>it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I
will be

<P>still too.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk and trembled

<P>through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away- away- to an

<P>indefinite distance- it died. The nightingale's song was then the only

<P>voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat

<P>quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before

<P>he spoke; he at last said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand
one

<P>another.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now,
and

<P>cannot return.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend
to

<P>marry.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent: I thought he mocked me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, Jane- come hither.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your bride stands between us.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose, and with a stride reached me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My bride is here,' he said, again drawing me to him, 'because
my

<P>equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from
his

<P>grasp: for I was still incredulous.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you doubt me, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Entirely.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have no faith in me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a whit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I a liar in your eyes?' he asked passionately. 'Little
sceptic,

<P>you shall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and

<P>that you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains

<P>to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a

<P>third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see

<P>the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not-

<P>I could not- marry Miss Ingram. You- you strange, you almost unearthly

<P>thing!- I love as my own flesh. You- poor and obscure, and small and

<P>plain as you are- I entreat to accept me as a husband.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, me!' I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness-
and

<P>especially in his incivility- to credit his sincerity: 'me who have

<P>not a friend in the world but you- if you are my friend: not a

<P>shilling but what you have given me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You, Jane, I must have you for my own- entirely my own.
Will you

<P>be mine? Say yes, quickly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I want to read your countenance- turn!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled,

<P>scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His face was very much agitated and very much flushed,
and there

<P>were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Jane, you torture me!' he exclaimed. 'With that searching

<P>and yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real,
my only

<P>feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion- they cannot torture.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gratitude!' he ejaculated; and added wildly- 'Jane, accept
me

<P>quickly. Say, Edward- give me my name- Edward- I will marry you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely
wish me

<P>to be your wife?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear
it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, sir, I will marry you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Edward- my little wife!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear Edward!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come to me- come to me entirely now,' said he; and added,
in his

<P>deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine,

<P>'Make my happiness- I will make yours.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God pardon me!' he subjoined ere long; 'and man meddle
not with

<P>me: I have her, and will hold her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- that is the best of it,' he said. And if I had loved
him

<P>less I should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage;

<P>but, sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting- called to

<P>the paradise of union- I thought only of the bliss given me to drink

<P>in so abundant a flow. Again and again he said, 'Are you happy, Jane?'

<P>And again and again I answered, 'Yes,' After which he murmured, 'It

<P>will atone- it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and

<P>cold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace

<P>her? Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It

<P>will expiate at God's tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do.

<P>For the world's judgment- I wash my hands thereof. For man's

<P>opinion- I defy it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set,
and we

<P>were all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I

<P>was. And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while

<P>wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We must go in,' said Mr. Rochester: 'the weather changes.
I

<P>could have sat with thee till morning, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so,' thought I, 'could I with you.' I should have
said so,

<P>perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I

<P>was looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling

<P>peal; and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr.

<P>Rochester's shoulder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through
the

<P>grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could

<P>pass the threshold. He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and

<P>shaking the water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged

<P>from her room. I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr.

<P>Rochester. The lamp was lit. The dock was on the stroke of twelve.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hasten to take off your wet things,' said he; 'and before
you

<P>go, good-night- good-night, my darling!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his
arms,

<P>there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at

<P>her, and ran upstairs. 'Explanation will do for another time,' thought

<P>I. Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she

<P>should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen. But joy soon

<P>effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and

<P>deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning

<P>gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours'

<P>duration, I experienced no fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came

<P>thrice to my door in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and

<P>tranquil: and that was comfort, that was strength for anything.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came
running in

<P>to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the

<P>orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it

<P>split away.
