<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction
to

<P>Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer

<P>acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out

<P>to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of

<P>competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively

<P>child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes

<P>wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no

<P>injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for

<P>her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became

<P>obedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits

<P>of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised

<P>her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had

<P>she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made

<P>reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps

<P>not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle,

<P>and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of

<P>attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by
persons

<P>who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children,

<P>and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for

<P>them an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter

<P>parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling

<P>the truth. I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and

<P>progress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I

<P>cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and

<P>a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had

<P>for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that,
now and

<P>then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down
to

<P>the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele

<P>played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,

<P>I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and

<P>having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and

<P>hill, and along dim sky-line- that then I longed for a power of vision

<P>which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,

<P>towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen- that then
I

<P>desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of

<P>intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,

<P>than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,

<P>and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other

<P>and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to

<P>behold.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called

<P>discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my

<P>nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to

<P>walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards,

<P>safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's

<P>eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it- and,

<P>certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by

<P>the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded

<P>it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that

<P>was never ended- a tale my imagination created, and narrated

<P>continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling,

<P>that I desired and had not in my actual existence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied
with

<P>tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they

<P>cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine,

<P>and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows

<P>how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses

<P>of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm

<P>generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for

<P>their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their

<P>brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a

<P>stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded

<P>in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to

<P>confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to

<P>playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to

<P>condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn

<P>more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's
laugh:

<P>the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had

<P>thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her

<P>laugh. There were days when she was quite silent; but there were

<P>others when I could not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I

<P>saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or
a

<P>tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally

<P>(oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing

<P>a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the

<P>curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she

<P>had no point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to

<P>draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a

<P>monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other members of the household, viz., John and his
wife, Leah

<P>the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but
in

<P>no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and

<P>sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she

<P>was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such

<P>vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than

<P>encourage inquiry.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; October, November, December passed away. One afternoon
in

<P>January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she

<P>had a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that

<P>reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my

<P>own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing

<P>pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold;

<P>I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long

<P>morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to

<P>be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry
it

<P>to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter

<P>afternoon walk. Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little

<P>chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her best wax

<P>doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to

<P>play with, and a story-book for a change of amusement; and having

<P>replied to her 'Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.

<P>Jeannette,' with a kiss I set out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely;
I

<P>walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and

<P>analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and

<P>situation. It was three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed

<P>under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching

<P>dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from

<P>Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and

<P>blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral

<P>treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its

<P>utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, it

<P>made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to

<P>rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as

<P>the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. Far

<P>and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now

<P>browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the

<P>hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached
the

<P>middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering

<P>my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel

<P>the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice

<P>covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had

<P>overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could

<P>look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the

<P>principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose

<P>against the, west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the

<P>trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet
as a

<P>cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half

<P>lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was

<P>yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly

<P>its thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in

<P>what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills

<P>beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes. That

<P>evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the

<P>sough of the most remote.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings,
at once

<P>so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,

<P>which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid

<P>mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and

<P>strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill,

<P>sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings
of

<P>the lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the

<P>stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In

<P>those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark

<P>tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst

<P>other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them

<P>a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse

<P>approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I

<P>remembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a

<P>North-of-England spirit called a 'Gytrash,' which, in the form of

<P>horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came

<P>upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition
to the

<P>tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the

<P>hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made

<P>him a distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of

<P>Bessie's Gytrash- a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head:

<P>it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with

<P>strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.

<P>The horse followed,- a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man,

<P>the human being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the

<P>Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though

<P>they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet

<P>shelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this,- only a

<P>traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went

<P>on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of

<P>'What the deuce is to do now?' and a clattering tumble, arrested my

<P>attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of

<P>ice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and

<P>seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan,

<P>barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in

<P>proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate group, and

<P>then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,- there was no other help

<P>at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller,

<P>by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts were
so

<P>vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the

<P>question-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you injured, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he
was

<P>pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me

<P>directly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can I do anything?' I asked again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must just stand on one side,' he answered as he rose,
first to

<P>his knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,

<P>stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying

<P>which removed me effectually some yards' distance; but I would not

<P>be driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate;

<P>the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a 'Down,

<P>Pilot!' The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if

<P>trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for

<P>he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious,
I think,

<P>for I now drew near him again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some
one either

<P>from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,- only a
sprain;'

<P>and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an

<P>involuntary 'Ugh!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was
waxing

<P>bright: I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a

<P>riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not

<P>apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and

<P>considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features

<P>and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and

<P>thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached

<P>middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him,

<P>and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young

<P>gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him

<P>against his will, and offering my services unasked. I had hardly

<P>ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one. I had a

<P>theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,

<P>fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine

<P>shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor

<P>could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned

<P>them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but

<P>antipathetic.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured
to me

<P>when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily

<P>and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any

<P>vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the

<P>traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to

<P>me to go, and announced-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour,
in this

<P>solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned
his eyes

<P>in my direction before.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should think you ought to be at home yourself,' said
he, 'if you

<P>have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out
late when

<P>it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if

<P>you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You live just below- do you mean at that house with the

<P>battlements?' pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a

<P>hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods, that,

<P>by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whose house is it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester's.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you know Mr. Rochester?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, I have never seen him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is not resident, then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you tell me where he is?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are-'
He

<P>stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple:

<P>a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine

<P>enough for a lady's-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I

<P>helped him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am the governess.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah, the governess!' he repeated; 'deuce take me, if I
had not

<P>forgotten! The governess!' and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.
In

<P>two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he

<P>tried to move.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot commission you to fetch help,' he said; 'but
you may help

<P>me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me:
you are

<P>not afraid?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone,
but when

<P>told to do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the

<P>stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the

<P>bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near

<P>its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was

<P>mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet. The traveller waited and

<P>watched for some time, and at last he laughed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I see,' he said, 'the mountain will never be brought to
Mahomet,

<P>so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must

<P>beg of you to come here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I came. 'Excuse me,' he continued: 'necessity compels me
to make

<P>you useful.' He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me

<P>with some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the

<P>bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing

<P>grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite,
'just

<P>hand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought it and found it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and
return as

<P>fast as you can.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and
rear,

<P>and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'Like heath that, in the wilderness,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The wild wind whirls away.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred
and

<P>was gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no

<P>interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a

<P>monotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given

<P>it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though

<P>the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an

<P>existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture

<P>introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all

<P>the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and,

<P>secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still

<P>before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the

<P>post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.

<P>When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and

<P>listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway

<P>again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland

<P>dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard

<P>willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the

<P>moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among

<P>the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down
in

<P>the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught

<P>a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I

<P>hurried on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold
was to

<P>return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome

<P>staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet

<P>tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and

<P>her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my

<P>walk,- to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an

<P>uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges

<P>of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What

<P>good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the

<P>storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by

<P>rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now

<P>repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of

<P>sitting still in a 'too easy chair' to take a long walk: and just as

<P>natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be

<P>under his.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced

<P>backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door

<P>were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and

<P>spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house- from the grey hollow filled

<P>with rayless cells, as it appeared to me- to that sky expanded

<P>before me,- a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon

<P>ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left

<P>the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below

<P>her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless

<P>depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that

<P>followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when

<P>I viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in

<P>the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a

<P>side-door, and went in.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the
high-hung

<P>bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the

<P>oak staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room,

<P>whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the

<P>grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing

<P>purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant

<P>radiance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had

<P>scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling

<P>of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele,

<P>when the door closed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there
too,

<P>but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting

<P>upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a

<P>great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the

<P>lane. It was so like it that I went forward and said- 'Pilot,' and the

<P>thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he

<P>wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone

<P>with, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for

<P>I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this

<P>visitant. Leah entered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What dog is this?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He came with master.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With whom?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With master- Mr. Rochester- he is just arrived.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and
John is gone

<P>for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and

<P>his ankle is sprained.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! Bring me a candle, will you, Leah?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax,
who

<P>repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and

<P>was now with Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders

<P>about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.
