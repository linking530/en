<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. ROCHESTER had given me but one week's leave of absence:
yet a

<P>month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave

<P>immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till

<P>she could get off to London, whither she was now at last invited by

<P>her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister's

<P>interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded

<P>being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in

<P>her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so
I

<P>bore with her feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as

<P>well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her and packing her

<P>dresses. It is true, that while I worked, she would idle; and I

<P>thought to myself, 'If you and I were destined to live always

<P>together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.

<P>I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I

<P>should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish

<P>it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your

<P>keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in

<P>your own breast. It is only because our connection happens to be

<P>very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I

<P>consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn
to request

<P>me to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and

<P>attention, she said; she was about to depart for some unknown

<P>bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted

<P>within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and

<P>holding no communication with any one. She wished me to look after the

<P>house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning she told me I was at liberty. 'And,' she added,
'I am

<P>obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!

<P>There is some difference between living with such an one as you and

<P>with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.

<P>To-morrow,' she continued, 'I set out for the Continent. I shall

<P>take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle- a nunnery you

<P>would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote

<P>myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and

<P>to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to

<P>be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the

<P>doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the

<P>tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted
to

<P>dissuade her from it. 'The vocation will fit you to a hair,' I

<P>thought: 'much good may it do you!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When we parted, she said: 'Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre;
I wish you

<P>well: you have some sense.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I then returned: 'You are not without sense, cousin Eliza;
but what

<P>you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a

<P>French convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you,
I

<P>don't much care.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are in the right,' said she; and with these words
we each went

<P>our separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to

<P>her or her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana

<P>made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and

<P>that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of

<P>the convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which

<P>she endowed with her fortune.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How people feel when they are returning home from an absence,

<P>long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the

<P>sensation. I had known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a

<P>child after a long walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and

<P>later, what it was to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a

<P>plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get either.

<P>Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no

<P>magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of

<P>attraction the nearer I came. The return to Thornfield was yet to be

<P>tried.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My journey seemed tedious- very tedious: fifty miles one
day, a

<P>night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first

<P>twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her

<P>disfigured and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered

<P>voice. I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black

<P>train of tenants and servants- few was the number of relatives- the

<P>gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I thought
of

<P>Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the

<P>other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed

<P>their separate peculiarities of person and character. The evening

<P>gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's bed, I

<P>left reminiscence for anticipation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay
there?

<P>Not long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the

<P>interim of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr.

<P>Rochester had left for London three weeks ago, but he was then

<P>expected to return in a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was

<P>gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of

<P>purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss

<P>Ingram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said,

<P>and from what she had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the

<P>event would shortly take place. 'You would be strangely incredulous
if

<P>you did doubt it,' was my mental comment. 'I don't doubt it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The question followed, 'Where was I to go?' I dreamt of
Miss Ingram

<P>all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates
of

<P>Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.

<P>Rochester looked on with his arms folded- smiling sardonically, as

<P>it seemed, at both her and me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my
return;

<P>for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I

<P>proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly,

<P>after leaving my box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the

<P>George Inn, about six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road

<P>to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now

<P>little frequented.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though
fair and

<P>soft: the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky,

<P>though far from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future:

<P>its blue- where blue was visible- was mild and settled, and its

<P>cloud strata high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam

<P>chilled it- it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning

<P>behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a

<P>golden redness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that
I stopped

<P>once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it

<P>was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or
to

<P>a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.

<P>'Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,' said I; 'and

<P>little Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know

<P>very well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not

<P>thinking of you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as

<P>inexperience? These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the

<P>privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me

<P>or not; and they added- 'Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may:

<P>but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for

<P>ever!' And then I strangled a new-born agony- a deformed thing which
I

<P>could not persuade myself to own and rear- and ran on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather,
the

<P>labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with

<P>their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have

<P>but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and

<P>reach the gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no

<P>time to gather any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall

<P>briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see

<P>the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see- Mr. Rochester sitting

<P>there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung:
for

<P>a moment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not

<P>think I should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice
or

<P>the power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can

<P>stir: I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way

<P>to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has

<P>seen me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hillo!' he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.
'There

<P>you are! Come on, if you please.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not;
being

<P>scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear

<P>calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face- which

<P>I feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express

<P>what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a veil- it is down: I may

<P>make shift yet to behave with decent composure.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and
on

<P>foot? Yes- just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and

<P>come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to

<P>steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if

<P>you were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with

<P>yourself this last month?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard. She comes
from the

<P>other world- from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so

<P>when she meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I'd touch

<P>you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!- but I'd as

<P>soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh.

<P>Truant! truant!' he added, when he had paused an instant. 'Absent from

<P>me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again,
even

<P>though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my

<P>master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there

<P>was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the

<P>power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he

<P>scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast

<P>genially. His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it

<P>imported something to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had

<P>spoken of Thornfield as my home- would that it were my home!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to
go by. I

<P>inquired soon if he had not been to London.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And did she inform you what I went to do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't
think it

<P>will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like

<P>Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish,

<P>Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.

<P>Tell me now, fairy as you are- can't you give me a charm, or a

<P>philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would be past the power of magic, sir'; and, in thought,
I

<P>added, 'A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome

<P>enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with
an

<P>acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no

<P>notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain

<P>smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He

<P>seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real

<P>sunshine of feeling- he shed it over me now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pass, Janet,' said he, making room for me to cross the
stile:

<P>'go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's

<P>threshold.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need
for me to

<P>colloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant

<P>to leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast- a force turned me round.

<P>I said- or something in me said for me, and in spite of me-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am

<P>strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my

<P>home- my only home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken
me had

<P>he tried. Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.

<P>Mrs. Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah

<P>smiled, and even Sophie bid me 'bon soir' with glee. This was very

<P>pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your

<P>fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to

<P>their comfort.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future:
I

<P>stopped my ears against the voice that kept warning me of near

<P>separation and coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had

<P>taken her knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and

<P>Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense

<P>of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace,

<P>I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but

<P>when, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and

<P>looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group

<P>so amicable- when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now

<P>that she had got her adopted daughter back again, and added that he

<P>saw Adele was 'prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise'- I half

<P>ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep us

<P>together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not

<P>quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield
Hall.

<P>Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation

<P>going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if

<P>she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the

<P>negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.

<P>Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he

<P>had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she

<P>could not tell what to make of him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were
no

<P>journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure

<P>it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what

<P>was that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and

<P>indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning's

<P>ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the

<P>match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or

<P>both parties had changed their minds. I used to look at my master's

<P>face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the

<P>time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings.

<P>If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and

<P>sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had he

<P>called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me

<P>when there- and, alas! never had I loved him so well.
