<B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE&nbsp; TO THE SECOND EDITION</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A PREFACE to the first edition of Jane Eyre being unnecessary,
I

<P>gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of

<P>acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My thanks are due in three quarters.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to
a plain

<P>tale with few pretensions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has
opened

<P>to an obscure aspirant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy,
their

<P>practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and

<P>unrecommended Author.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Press and the Public are but vague personifications
for me, and

<P>I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so

<P>are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only

<P>large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling

<P>stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers,

<P>I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided
and

<P>approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know,

<P>but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping

<P>few who doubt the tendency of such books as Jane Eyre: in whose eyes

<P>whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest

<P>against bigotry- that parent of crime- an insult to piety, that regent

<P>of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious

<P>distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is
not

<P>religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck

<P>the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand

<P>to the Crown of Thorns.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they
are as

<P>distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they

<P>should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth;

<P>narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few,

<P>should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.

<P>There is- I repeat it- a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad

<P>action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between

<P>them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for
it has

<P>been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make

<P>external show pass for sterling worth- to let white-washed walls vouch

<P>for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose-

<P>to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it- to penetrate the

<P>sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is

<P>indebted to him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied
good

<P>concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of

<P>Chenaanah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he

<P>but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed
to tickle

<P>delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of

<P>society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of

<P>Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as

<P>prophet-like and as vital- a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the

<P>satirist of Vanity Fair admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I

<P>think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his

<P>sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation,

<P>were to take his warnings in time- they or their seed might yet escape

<P>a fatal Ramoth-Gilead.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him,
Reader,

<P>because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique

<P>than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as

<P>the first social regenerator of the day- as the very master of that

<P>working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of

<P>things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found

<P>the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise

<P>his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit,

<P>humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a

<P>vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.

<P>His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same

<P>relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning

<P>playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric

<P>death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray,

<P>because to him- if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger- I

<P>have dedicated this second edition of Jane Eyre.
