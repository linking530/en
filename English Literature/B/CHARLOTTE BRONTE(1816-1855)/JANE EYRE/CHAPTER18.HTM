<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MERRY days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days
too: how

<P>different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and

<P>solitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now

<P>driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was

<P>life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the

<P>gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so

<P>tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the

<P>entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void

<P>and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial

<P>spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds. Even

<P>when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some

<P>days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only

<P>became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to

<P>outdoor gaiety.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wondered what they were going to do the first evening
a change of

<P>entertainment was proposed: they spoke of 'playing charades,' but in

<P>my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called

<P>in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise

<P>disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While

<P>Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations,

<P>the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids.

<P>Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources

<P>of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain

<P>wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in

<P>the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black

<P>modes, lace lappets, etc., were brought down in armfuls by the

<P>abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen

<P>were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round
him,

<P>and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. 'Miss

<P>Ingram is mine, of course,' said he: afterwards he named the two

<P>Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near

<P>him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet,

<P>which had got loose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you play?' he asked. I shook my head. He did not
insist,

<P>which I rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return

<P>quietly to my usual seat.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other
party,

<P>which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of

<P>chairs. One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to

<P>propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly

<P>negatived the notion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' I heard her say: 'she looks too stupid for any game
of the

<P>sort.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within
the

<P>arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had

<P>likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on
a

<P>table, lay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped

<P>in Mr. Rochester's cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody,

<P>unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being

<P>one of her guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering round her

<P>the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then

<P>appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a

<P>long veil on her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her

<P>side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They

<P>knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white,

<P>took up their stations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show,

<P>in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At

<P>its termination, Colonel Dent, and his party consulted in whispers for

<P>two minutes, then the Colonel called out-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bride!' Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its
second

<P>rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.

<P>The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps

<P>above the dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard

<P>or two back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I

<P>recognised as an ornament of the conservatory- where it usually stood,

<P>surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish- and whence it must

<P>have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and

<P>weight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen
Mr.

<P>Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark

<P>eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume

<P>exactly: he looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a

<P>victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.

<P>She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied

<P>sash-like round the waist; an embroidered handkerchief knotted about

<P>her temples; her beautifully moulded arms bare, one of them upraised

<P>in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.

<P>Both her cast of form and feature, her complexion and her general air,

<P>suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal

<P>days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill
her

<P>pitcher; she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the

<P>well-brink now seemed to accost her; to make some request:- 'She

<P>hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.' From

<P>the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket, opened it and

<P>showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment

<P>and admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet;

<P>incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures;

<P>the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her

<P>ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently
they

<P>could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.

<P>Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded 'the tableau of the whole';

<P>whereupon the curtain again descended.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room
was

<P>disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort

<P>of dark and coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place

<P>stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible

<P>by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles

<P>being all extinguished.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands
resting

<P>on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;

<P>though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose

<P>from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a

<P>scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance the rough,

<P>bristling hair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain

<P>clanked; to his wrists were attached fetters.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bridewell!' exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was
solved.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers
to resume

<P>their ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester

<P>led in Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you know,' said she, 'that, of the three characters,
I liked

<P>you in the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier,

<P>what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is all the soot washed from my face?' he asked, turning
it towards

<P>her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Alas! yes: the more's the pity! Nothing could be more
becoming

<P>to your complexion than that ruffian's rouge.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would like a hero of the road then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'An English hero of the road would be the next best thing
to an

<P>Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine

<P>pirate.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were
married

<P>an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.' She giggled,

<P>and her colour rose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Dent,' continued Mr. Rochester, 'it is your turn.'
And as the

<P>other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss

<P>Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners

<P>filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the

<P>actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my

<P>attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on

<P>the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.

<P>What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they

<P>chose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I

<P>still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr.

<P>Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her

<P>incline her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his

<P>shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear their mutual

<P>whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something even

<P>of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this

<P>moment.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr.
Rochester: I

<P>could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased
to

<P>notice me- because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would

<P>never once turn his eyes in my direction- because I saw all his

<P>attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me

<P>with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and

<P>imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as

<P>from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove

<P>him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady- because
I

<P>read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-

<P>because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if

<P>careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in

<P>its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride,

<P>irresistible.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances,

<P>though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to

<P>engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be

<P>jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very

<P>rarely;- the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by

<P>that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too

<P>inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean

<P>what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a

<P>fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her

<P>heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil;
no

<P>unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good;

<P>she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from

<P>books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She

<P>advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the

<P>sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.

<P>Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a

<P>spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her

<P>away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;

<P>sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with

<P>coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these

<P>manifestations of character- watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.

<P>Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over

<P>his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this

<P>sagacity- this guardedness of his- this perfect, clear consciousness

<P>of his fair one's defects- this obvious absence of passion in his

<P>sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain arose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political

<P>reasons, because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had

<P>not given her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted

<P>to win from him that treasure. This was the point- this was where

<P>the nerve was touched and teased- this was where the fever was

<P>sustained and fed: she could not charm him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded
and

<P>sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face,

<P>turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss

<P>Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour,

<P>kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers-

<P>jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should

<P>have admired her- acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for

<P>the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper

<P>would have been my admiration- the more truly tranquil my

<P>quiescence. But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's

<P>efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated

<P>failure- herself unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying

<P>that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming

<P>herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled

<P>further and further what she wished to allure- to witness this, was
to

<P>be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.

<P>Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and

<P>fell harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand,

<P>have quivered keen in his proud heart- have called love into his stern

<P>eye, and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without

<P>weapons a silent conquest might have been won.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged
to draw

<P>so near to him?' I asked myself. 'Surely she cannot truly like him,
or

<P>not like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her

<P>smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture

<P>airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she

<P>might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and

<P>looking less, get nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far

<P>different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so

<P>vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not

<P>elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had

<P>but to accept it- to answer what he asked without pretension, to

<P>address him when needful without grimace- and it increased and grew

<P>kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam. How

<P>will she manage to please him when they are married? I do not think

<P>she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife might,
I

<P>verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's

<P>project of marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when

<P>I first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a

<P>man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his

<P>choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education,

<P>etc., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming

<P>either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and

<P>principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All

<P>their class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had

<P>reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me

<P>that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take to my bosom only

<P>such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the

<P>advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan

<P>convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption

<P>of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world

<P>would act as I wished to act.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very
lenient to

<P>my master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once

<P>kept a sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study

<P>all sides of his character: to take the bad with the good; and from

<P>the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw
no

<P>bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled
me

<P>once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their

<P>presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively

<P>insipid. And as for the vague something- was it a sinister or a

<P>sorrowful, a designing or a desponding expression?- that opened upon
a

<P>careful observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before

<P>one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something

<P>which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering

<P>amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground

<P>quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld

<P>still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves.

<P>Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare- to divine it; and
I

<P>thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might look into the

<P>abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their nature.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future
bride-

<P>saw only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their

<P>movements of importance- the rest of the party were occupied with

<P>their own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram

<P>continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their

<P>two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting

<P>gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme
on

<P>which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs.

<P>Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes

<P>bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel

<P>Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice

<P>business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and

<P>sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened

<P>languidly to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with

<P>one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the

<P>principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and- because closely

<P>connected with him- Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party.

<P>If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed

<P>to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was

<P>sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly

<P>felt one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and

<P>was not likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk

<P>the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched

<P>on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the

<P>gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with

<P>the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The

<P>dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards.

<P>Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity,

<P>some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into

<P>conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and

<P>airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the

<P>library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and

<P>prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of

<P>absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then the

<P>merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was verging on dusk, and the dock had already given
warning of

<P>the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in

<P>the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Voila Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa:
the

<P>others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same

<P>time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became

<P>audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What can possess him to come home in that style?' said
Miss

<P>Ingram. 'He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went

<P>out? and Pilot was with him:- what has he done with the animals?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample
garments

<P>so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the

<P>breaking of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at

<P>first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another

<P>casement. The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell,

<P>and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not

<P>Mr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How provoking!' exclaimed Miss Ingram: 'you tiresome monkey!'

<P>(apostrophising Adele), 'who perched you up in the window to give

<P>false intelligence?' and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I

<P>were in fault.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the newcomer

<P>entered. He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady

<P>present.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,' said
he, 'when

<P>my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very

<P>long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate

<P>acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck
me as

<P>being somewhat unusual,- not precisely foreign, but still not

<P>altogether English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,- between

<P>thirty and forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he

<P>was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer

<P>examination, you detected something in his face that displeased, or

<P>rather that failed to please. His features were regular, but too

<P>relaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of

<P>it was a tame, vacant life- at least so I thought.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It
was not till

<P>after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.

<P>But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as

<P>being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered,

<P>and had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such

<P>as I never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an

<P>unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no

<P>power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness
in

<P>that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the

<P>low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light
of

<P>the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him- for he

<P>occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire and kept shrinking still

<P>nearer, as if he were cold- I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think

<P>(with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater

<P>between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and

<P>the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious

<P>friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of

<P>the old adage that 'extremes meet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught
at times

<P>scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not

<P>make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton

<P>and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary

<P>sentences that reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the

<P>stranger; they both called him 'a beautiful man.' Louisa said he was

<P>'a love of a creature,' and she 'adored him'; and Mary instanced his

<P>'pretty little mouth, and nice nose,' as her ideal of the charming.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what a sweet-tempered forehead he hast' cried Louisa,-
'so

<P>smooth- none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and

<P>such a placid eye and smile!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them
to the

<P>other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred

<P>excursion to Hay Common.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group
by the

<P>fire, and I presently gathered that the newcomer was called Mr. Mason;

<P>then I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he

<P>came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his

<P>face was so sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a

<P>surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish

<P>Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no

<P>little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and

<P>become acquainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend's dislike

<P>of the burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that

<P>region. I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had

<P>said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his

<P>wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to

<P>more distant shores.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat

<P>unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering

<P>as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put
on

<P>the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder

<P>still shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going

<P>out, stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a

<P>low voice, of which I heard only the words, 'old woman,'- 'quite

<P>troublesome.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not
take

<P>herself off,' replied the magistrate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- stop!' interrupted Colonel Dent. 'Don't send her away,
Eshton;

<P>we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.' And

<P>speaking aloud, he continued- 'Ladies, you talked of going to Hay

<P>Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old

<P>Mother Bunches is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists

<P>upon being brought in before "the quality," to tell them their

<P>fortunes. Would you like to see her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Surely, colonel,' cried Lady Ingram, 'you would not encourage
such

<P>a low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,' said the

<P>footman; 'nor can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just

<P>now, entreating her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the

<P>chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir her from it till she

<P>gets leave to come in here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does she want?' asked Mrs. Eshton.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"To tell the gentry their fortunes," she says, ma'am;
and she

<P>swears she must and will do it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is she like?' inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black
as a crock.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, she's a real sorceress!' cried Frederick Lynn. 'Let
us have

<P>her in, of course.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be sure,' rejoined his brother; 'it would be a thousand

<P>pities to throw away such a chance of fun.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dear boys, what are you thinking about?' exclaimed
Mrs. Lynn.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,'

<P>chimed in the Dowager Ingram.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed, mama, but you can- and will,' pronounced the haughty
voice

<P>of Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she

<P>had sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. 'I have
a

<P>curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame

<P>forward.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My darling Blanche! recollect-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do- I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have
my will-

<P>quick, Sam!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- yes- yes!' cried all the juveniles, both ladies and

<P>gentlemen. 'Let her come- it will be excellent sport!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The footman still lingered. 'She looks such a rough one,'
said he.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go!' ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running
fire of

<P>raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She won't come now,' said he. 'She says it's not her mission
to

<P>appear before the "vulgar herd" (them's her words). I must show her

<P>into a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must
go

<P>to her one by one.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see now, my queenly Blanche,' began Lady Ingram, 'she

<P>encroaches. Be advised, my angel girl- and-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Show her into the library, of course,' cut in the 'angel
girl,'

<P>'It is not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd

<P>either: I mean to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the

<P>library?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, ma'am- but she looks such a tinkler.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation
rose to

<P>full flow once more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She's ready now,' said the footman, as he reappeared.
'She

<P>wishes to know who will be her first visitor.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I had better just look in upon her before any
of the

<P>ladies go,' said Colonel Dent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam went and returned.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need
not

<P>trouble themselves to come near her; nor,' he added, with difficulty

<P>suppressing a titter, 'any ladies either, except the young and

<P>single.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'By Jove, she has taste!' exclaimed Henry Lynn.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Ingram rose solemnly: 'I go first,' she said, in a
tone

<P>which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a

<P>breach in the van of his men.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause- reflect!' was her
mama's

<P>cry; but she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the

<P>door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it 'le
cas' to

<P>wring her hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she

<P>felt, for her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton

<P>tittered under their breath, and looked a little frightened.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before
the

<P>library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the

<P>arch.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Would she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes
met her with

<P>a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff

<P>and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked

<P>stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Blanche?' said Lord Ingram.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did she say, sister?' asked Mary.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real

<P>fortune-teller?' demanded the Misses Eshton.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, now, good people,' returned Miss Ingram, 'don't press
upon

<P>me. Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you

<P>seem, by the importance you all- my good mama included- ascribe to

<P>this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the

<P>house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen

<P>a gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science

<P>of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is

<P>gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in

<P>the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so
declined

<P>further conversation. I watched her for nearly half an hour: during

<P>all that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently

<P>darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of

<P>disappointment. She had obviously not heard anything to her advantage:

<P>and it seemed to me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and

<P>taciturnity, that she herself, notwithstanding her professed

<P>indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had

<P>been made her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared
they dared

<P>not go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was

<P>opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much

<P>pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have

<P>ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great

<P>difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait

<P>upon her in a body.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been:
we heard

<P>hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library;

<P>and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and

<P>came running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their

<P>wits.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure she is something not right!' they cried, one
and all.

<P>'She told us such things! She knows all about us!' and they sank

<P>breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring

<P>them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had
told them of

<P>things they had said and done when they were mere children;

<P>described books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home:

<P>keepsakes that different relations had presented to them. They

<P>affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered

<P>in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the world,

<P>and informed them of what they most wished for.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to
be

<P>further enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got

<P>only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for

<P>their importunity. The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and

<P>wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of their

<P>concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and the elder

<P>gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the

<P>agitated fair ones.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears
were fully

<P>engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I

<P>turned, and saw Sam.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is
another

<P>young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she

<P>swears she will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be

<P>you: there is no one else for it. What shall I tell her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I will go by all means,' I answered: and I was glad
of the

<P>unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped

<P>out of the room, unobserved by any eye- for the company were

<P>gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned- and I

<P>closed the door quietly behind me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you like, miss,' said Sam, 'I'll wait in the hall for
you;

<P>and if she frightens you, just call and I'll come in.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least
afraid.' Nor

<P>was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
