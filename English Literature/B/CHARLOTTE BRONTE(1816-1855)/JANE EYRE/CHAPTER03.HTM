<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling
as if I

<P>had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red

<P>glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking

<P>with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water:

<P>agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror

<P>confused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was

<P>handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and

<P>that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I

<P>rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved:
I knew

<P>quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the

<P>nursery fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie

<P>stood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat
in

<P>a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of
protection

<P>and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an

<P>individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.

<P>Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to

<P>me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised

<P>the face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an

<P>apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were

<P>ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, who am I?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my
hand: he

<P>took it, smiling and saying, 'We shall do very well by and by.' Then

<P>he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful

<P>that I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further

<P>directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he

<P>departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat

<P>in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him,

<P>all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness

<P>weighed it down.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?' asked Bessie,
rather

<P>softly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence
might

<P>be rough. 'I will try.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, thank you, Bessie.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve
o'clock; but

<P>you may call me if you want anything in the night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying;
you'll be

<P>better soon, no doubt.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.
I heard

<P>her say-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't
for my

<P>life be alone with that poor child tonight: she might die; it's such
a

<P>strange thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw

<P>anything. Missis was rather too hard.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were

<P>whispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep. I caught

<P>scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too

<P>distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished'-
'A

<P>great black dog behind him'- 'Three loud raps on the chamber door'-

<P>'A light in the churchyard just over his grave,' etc., etc.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For
me, the

<P>watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye,

<P>and mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can

<P>feel.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident
of the

<P>red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the

<P>reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful

<P>pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew

<P>not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were

<P>only uprooting my bad propensities.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped
in a shawl

<P>by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but

<P>my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a

<P>wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had

<P>I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I

<P>thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there,

<P>they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too,

<P>was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and

<P>thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me

<P>every now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things

<P>should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a

<P>life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my

<P>racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe,

<P>and no pleasure excite them agreeably.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought
up with

<P>her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of

<P>paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been

<P>wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and

<P>which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand
in

<P>order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been

<P>deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now

<P>placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of

<P>delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other

<P>favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not

<P>eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers,

<P>seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked

<P>if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus,

<P>and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from the library. This

<P>book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a

<P>narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper

<P>than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought

<P>them in vain among fox-glove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and

<P>beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made

<P>up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England
to

<P>some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the

<P>population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdingnag being, in

<P>my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I

<P>might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the

<P>little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny

<P>cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields,

<P>forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men

<P>and women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now

<P>placed in my hand- when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its

<P>marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find-

<P>all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies

<P>malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most

<P>dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no

<P>longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and
having

<P>washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid

<P>shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for

<P>Georgiana's doll. Meantime she sang: her song was-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'In the days when we were gipsying,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A long time ago.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had often heard the song before, and always with lively

<P>delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,- at least, I thought so. But

<P>now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an

<P>indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she

<P>sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; 'A long time ago' came

<P>out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into

<P>another ballad, this time a really doleful one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the path of the poor orphan child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did they send me so far and so lonely,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are
piled?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam
mild,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; God, in His mercy, protection is showing,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a thought that for strength should avail me,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is a friend to the poor orphan child.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, Miss Jane, don't cry,' said Bessie as she finished.
She

<P>might as well have said to the fire, 'don't burn!' but how could she

<P>divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of

<P>the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, already up!' said he, as he entered the nursery.
'Well,

<P>nurse, how is she?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie answered that I was doing very well.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Mis Jane:
your

<P>name is Jane, is it not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell
me what

<P>about? Have you any pain?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out
with

<P>Missis in the carriage,' interposed Bessie.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the
false

<P>charge, I answered promptly, 'I never cried for such a thing in my

<P>life: I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh fie, Miss!' said Bessie.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing

<P>before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small

<P>and grey; not very bright, but I daresay I should think them shrewd

<P>now: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having

<P>considered me at leisure, he said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What made you ill yesterday?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She had a fall,' said Bessie, again putting in her word.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can't she manage
to walk

<P>at her age? She must be eight or nine years old.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was knocked down,' was the blunt explanation, jerked
out of me

<P>by another pang of mortified pride; 'but that did not make me ill,'

<P>I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a
loud bell

<P>rang for the servants' dinner; he knew what it was. 'That's for you,

<P>nurse,' said he; 'you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture

<P>till you come back.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to
go, because

<P>punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gates-head Hall.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?' pursued
Mr.

<P>Lloyd when Bessie was gone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after
dark.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. 'Ghost!
What, you

<P>are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was
laid out

<P>there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if

<P>they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a

<P>candle,- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you
afraid

<P>now in daylight?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: but night will come again before long: and besides,-
I am

<P>unhappy,- very unhappy, for other things.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What other things? Can you tell me some of them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How
difficult it

<P>was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse

<P>their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in

<P>thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in

<P>words. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity

<P>of relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause,

<P>contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or
sisters.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have a kind aunt and cousins.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up
in the

<P>red-room.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?'
asked

<P>he. 'Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right
to be

<P>here than a servant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such
a splendid

<P>place?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave
it; but

<P>I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you may- who knows? Have you any relations besides
Mrs.

<P>Reed?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think not, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None belonging to your father?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly
I

<P>might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew

<P>nothing about them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you had such, would you like to go to them?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still
more so to

<P>children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable

<P>poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,

<P>scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices:

<P>poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I should not like to belong to poor people,' was my
reply.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not even if they were kind to you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the
means of

<P>being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their

<P>manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw

<P>sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the

<P>cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough

<P>to purchase liberty at the price of caste.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working
people?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must
be a

<P>beggarly set: I should not like to go a-begging.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would you like to go to school?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie

<P>sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks,

<P>wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and

<P>precise: John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John

<P>Reed's tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of

<P>school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where

<P>she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her

<P>details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies

<P>were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful

<P>paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they

<P>could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of

<P>French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to

<P>emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change:

<P>it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an

<P>entrance into a new life.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should indeed like to go to school,' was the audible

<P>conclusion of my musings.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, well! who knows what may happen?' said Mr. Lloyd,
as he

<P>got up. 'The child ought to have change of air and scene,' he added,

<P>speaking to himself; 'nerves not in a good state.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was
heard

<P>rolling up the gravel-walk.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that your mistress, nurse?' asked Mr. Lloyd. 'I should
like

<P>to speak to her before I go.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and
led the way

<P>out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I

<P>presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to

<P>recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt

<P>readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject

<P>with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was

<P>in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, 'Missis was, she dared say, glad

<P>enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who

<P>always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots

<P>underhand.' Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of

<P>infantine Guy Fawkes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from
Miss

<P>Abbot's communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor

<P>clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her

<P>friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather

<P>Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a

<P>shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the

<P>latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a

<P>large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that

<P>disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from

<P>him, and both died within a month of each other.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said,
'Poor

<P>Miss Jane is to be pitied too, Abbot.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' responded Abbot; 'if she were a nice, pretty child,
one

<P>might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for

<P>such a little toad as that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a great deal, to be sure,' agreed Bessie: 'at any
rate, a

<P>beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same

<P>condition.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!' cried the fervent Abbot.
'Little

<P>darling!- with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet

<P>colour as she has; just as if she were painted!- Bessie, I could fancy

<P>a Welsh rabbit for supper.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So could I- with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down.'
They went.
