<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I BOTH wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day
which

<P>followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet

<P>feared to meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I

<P>momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of

<P>entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes

<P>sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it

<P>that day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened
to interrupt

<P>the quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I

<P>heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber,

<P>Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's- that is, John's

<P>wife- and even John's own gruff tones. There were exclamations of

<P>'What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!' 'It is always

<P>dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.' 'How providential that he

<P>had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!' 'I wonder he waked

<P>nobody!' 'It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the

<P>library sofa,' etc.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and
setting to

<P>rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I

<P>saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete

<P>order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the

<P>window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about

<P>to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of

<P>the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber-
a

<P>woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new

<P>curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in
her brown

<P>stuff gown, her check apron, White handkerchief, and cap. She was

<P>intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on

<P>her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either

<P>of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see

<P>marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose

<P>intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I

<P>believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I

<P>was amazed-confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no

<P>start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion,

<P>consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said 'Good

<P>morning, Miss,' in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking

<P>up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will put her to some test,' thought I: 'such absolute

<P>impenetrability is past comprehension.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good morning, Grace,' I said. 'Has anything happened here?
I

<P>thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he
fell asleep

<P>with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately,

<P>he awoke before the bedclothes or the woodwork caught, and contrived

<P>to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A strange affair!' I said, in a low voice: then, looking
at her

<P>fixedly- 'Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was

<P>something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to

<P>examine me warily; then she answered-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would
not be

<P>likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to

<P>master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get

<P>elderly, they often sleep heavy.' She paused, and then added, with a

<P>sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant

<P>tone- 'But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper:

<P>perhaps you may have heard a noise?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did,' said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was
still

<P>polishing the panes, could not hear me, 'and at first I thought it was

<P>Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and
a

<P>strange one.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully,
threaded

<P>her needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect

<P>composure-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think,
Miss, when

<P>he was in such danger: you must have been dreaming.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was not dreaming,' I said, with some warmth, for her
brazen

<P>coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same

<P>scrutinising and conscious eye.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you told master that you heard a laugh?' she inquired.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this
morning.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did not think of opening your door and looking out
into the

<P>gallery?' she further asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to
draw from me

<P>information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew

<P>or suspected her guilt, she would be playing off some of her malignant

<P>pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I bolted my door.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every
night

<P>before you get into bed?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her
plans

<P>accordingly!' Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied

<P>sharply, 'Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did

<P>not think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was
to

<P>be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future' (and I laid marked

<P>stress on the words) 'I shall take good care to make all secure before

<P>I venture to lie down.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It will be wise so to do,' was her answer: 'this neighbourhood

<P>is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being

<P>attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds

<P>of pounds' worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And

<P>you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants,

<P>because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being

<P>a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best

<P>to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well
to

<P>have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A

<P>deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say

<P>Providence will not dispense with the means, though He often blesses

<P>them when they are used discreetly.' And here she closed her harangue:

<P>a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared
to me her

<P>miraculous self-possession, and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the

<P>cook entered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Poole,' said she, addressing Grace, 'the servants'
dinner

<P>will soon be ready: will you come down?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a
tray, and

<P>I'll carry it upstairs.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You'll have some meat?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the sago?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before

<P>tea-time: I'll make it myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was
waiting

<P>for me: so I departed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain

<P>conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my

<P>brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more

<P>in pondering the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning

<P>why she had not been given into custody that morning, or, at the

<P>very least, dismissed from her master's service. He had almost as much

<P>as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what

<P>mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined

<P>me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty

<P>gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his

<P>dependants; so much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand

<P>against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the attempt,

<P>much less punish her for it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted
to

<P>think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr.

<P>Rochester in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was,

<P>the idea could not be admitted. 'Yet,' I reflected, 'she has been

<P>young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs.

<P>Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I don't think she

<P>can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess

<P>originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of

<P>personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and

<P>eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a

<P>freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has

<P>delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions
a

<P>secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he

<P>cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?' But, having reached this

<P>point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat figure, and uncomely,

<P>dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind's eye, that
I

<P>thought, 'No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,'

<P>suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, 'you

<P>are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at

<P>any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night- remember

<P>his words; remember his look; remember his voice!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed
at the

<P>moment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was

<P>drawing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with
a

<P>sort of start.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Qu'avez-vous, mademoiselle?' said she. 'Vos doigts tremblent
comme

<P>la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am hot, Adele, with stooping!' She went on sketching;
I went

<P>on thinking.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had
been

<P>conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared

<P>myself with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said
I

<P>was quite a lady; and she spoke truth- I was a lady. And now I

<P>looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour

<P>and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes

<P>and keener enjoyments.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Evening approaches,' said I, as I looked towards the window.
'I

<P>have never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day;

<P>but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the

<P>morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled

<P>that it is grown impatient.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go
and play in

<P>the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for

<P>the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a

<P>message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and

<P>I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door

<P>remained shut; darkness only came in through the window. Still it

<P>was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and

<P>it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed

<P>to-night, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to

<P>introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would

<P>answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she

<P>who had made last night's hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept

<P>her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity

<P>irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by

<P>turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always

<P>prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I

<P>never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.

<P>Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station,

<P>I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint;

<P>this suited both him and me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance;

<P>but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

<P>Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought

<P>me, I imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must want your tea,' said the good lady, as I joined
her; 'you

<P>ate so little at dinner. I am afraid,' she continued, 'you are not

<P>well to-day: you look flushed and feverish.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, quite well! I never felt better.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will
you

<P>fill the teapot while I knit off this needle?' Having completed her

<P>task, she rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up,

<P>by way, I suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now

<P>fast deepening into total obscurity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is fair to-night,' said she, as she looked through
the panes,

<P>'though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a

<P>favourable day for his journey.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Journey!- Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know
he was

<P>out.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfast! He is gone
to the

<P>Leas, Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I

<P>believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir

<P>George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you expect him back to-night?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely
to stay

<P>a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they

<P>are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all

<P>that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.

<P>Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr.

<P>Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he

<P>is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you

<P>would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him

<P>particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and

<P>abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any

<P>little fault of look.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are there ladies at the Leas?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters- very elegant

<P>young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary

<P>Ingram, most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche,

<P>six or seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came

<P>here to a Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have

<P>seen the dining-room that day- how richly it was decorated, how

<P>brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and

<P>gentlemen present- all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram

<P>was considered the belle of the evening.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open;
and, as it

<P>was Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall,

<P>to hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have

<P>me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I

<P>never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently

<P>dressed; most of them- at least most of the younger ones- looked

<P>handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what was she like?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck:
olive

<P>complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.

<P>Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then

<P>she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly

<P>arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest,

<P>the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an

<P>amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her

<P>breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below

<P>her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it

<P>contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was greatly admired, of course?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her

<P>accomplishments. She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman

<P>accompanied her on the piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for
music.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it
was a

<P>treat to listen to her;- and she played afterwards. I am no judge of

<P>music, but Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was

<P>remarkably good.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet
married.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have
very large

<P>fortunes. Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the

<P>eldest son came in for everything almost.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken
a fancy to

<P>her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference
in age:

<P>Mr. Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would
entertain an

<P>idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted

<P>since you began tea.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another
cup?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about again to revert to the probability of a union
between

<P>Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the

<P>conversation was turned into another channel.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had
got;

<P>looked into my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and

<P>endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying

<P>through imagination's boundless and trackless waste, into the safe

<P>fold of common sense.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence
of the

<P>hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night- of

<P>the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a

<P>fortnight past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own

<P>quiet way, a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the

<P>real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;- I pronounced judgment to this

<P>effect:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the
breath of

<P>life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet

<P>lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You,' I said, 'a favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted
with the

<P>power of pleasing him? You of importance to him in any way? Go! your

<P>folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens

<P>of preference- equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a

<P>man of the world to a dependant and a novice. How dared you? Poor

<P>stupid dupe!- Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You

<P>repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?-

<P>Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your

<P>eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your

<P>own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered

<P>by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is

<P>madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which,

<P>if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and,
if

<P>discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry

<P>wilds whence there is no extrication.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow,
place the

<P>glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully,

<P>without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no

<P>displeasing irregularity; write under it, "Portrait of a Governess,

<P>disconnected, poor, and plain."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory- you have one
prepared in

<P>your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest,

<P>clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils;

<P>delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in

<P>your softest shades and sweetest hues, according to the description

<P>given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven

<P>ringlets, the oriental eye;- What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a

<P>model! Order! No snivel!- no sentiment!- no regret! I will endure only

<P>sense and resolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the

<P>Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible,

<P>and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet;

<P>portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin,

<P>graceful scarf and golden rose; call it "Blanche, an accomplished lady

<P>of rank."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester

<P>thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say,

<P>"Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he

<P>chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious

<P>thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?"'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll do it,' I resolved: and having framed this determination,
I

<P>grew calm, and fell asleep.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own
portrait

<P>in crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory

<P>miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face

<P>enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast

<P>was as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from

<P>the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given

<P>force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly

<P>on my heart.
