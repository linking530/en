<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing
by

<P>rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the

<P>ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change

<P>had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen

<P>north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows

<P>all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the

<P>contents of the ewers to ice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading
was

<P>over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last,

<P>and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was

<P>eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished

<P>it had been doubled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the
fourth

<P>class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto,
I

<P>had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to

<P>become an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn
by

<P>heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the

<P>frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was

<P>glad when, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into

<P>my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle,

<P>thimble, etc., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom,

<P>with directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others

<P>were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's

<P>chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons

<P>could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl

<P>acquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss

<P>Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history: among the

<P>readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the

<P>commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the

<P>class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to

<P>stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that

<P>obscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of

<P>constant notice; she was continually addressing to her such phrases
as

<P>the following:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Burns' (such it seems was her name: the girls here were
all called

<P>by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), 'Burns, you are standing
on

<P>the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.' 'Burns, you

<P>poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.' 'Burns, I insist on

<P>your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that

<P>attitude,' etc. etc.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A chapter having been read through twice, the books were
closed and

<P>the girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of

<P>Charles I, and there were sundry questions about tonnage and

<P>poundage and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer;

<P>still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached

<P>Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole

<P>lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept

<P>expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead

<P>of that, she suddenly cried out-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your
nails

<P>this morning!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why,' thought I, 'does she not explain that she could
neither

<P>clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring
me to hold a

<P>skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from

<P>time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether

<P>I could mark, stitch, knit, etc.; till she dismissed me, I could not

<P>pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements. When I

<P>returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which
I

<P>did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and

<P>going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned
in

<P>half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together
at

<P>one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a

<P>respectful curtsey; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed

<P>her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her

<P>neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to

<P>Burns's eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers

<P>quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent

<P>anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary

<P>expression.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hardened girl!' exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; 'nothing can
correct you

<P>of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from
the

<P>book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her

<P>pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest
fraction

<P>of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee

<P>swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not

<P>satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the

<P>schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning- its fires being allowed
to

<P>burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place

<P>of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed

<P>uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of

<P>liberty.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd
flog

<P>her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and

<P>laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I

<P>passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out;

<P>it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;

<P>putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the

<P>gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents,
this

<P>would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted

<P>the separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart, this

<P>obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from

<P>both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the

<P>wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the

<P>confusion to rise to clamour.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my
way to one

<P>of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found

<P>Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the

<P>companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the

<P>embers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it still Rasselas?' I asked, coming behind her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' she said, 'and I have just finished it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of
this.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' thought I, 'I can perhaps get her to talk.' I sat
down by

<P>her on the floor.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is your name besides Burns?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you come a long way from here?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders
of

<P>Scotland.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you ever go back?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must wish to leave Lowood?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education;
and it

<P>would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should

<P>resist her. If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her

<P>hand; I should break it under her nose.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you
did, Mr.

<P>Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great

<P>grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a

<P>smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action

<P>whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and

<P>besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be
sent to

<P>stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great

<P>girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not
avoid it:

<P>it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to
be

<P>required to bear.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine
of

<P>endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the

<P>forbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen

<P>Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected

<P>she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter

<P>deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you
seem very

<P>good.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am,
as Miss

<P>Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in

<P>order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my

<P>lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot

<P>bear to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very

<P>provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and

<P>particular.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And cross and cruel,' I added; but Helen Burns would not
admit

<P>my addition: she kept silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted
over

<P>her grave face.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe
to

<P>any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells

<P>me of them gently; and if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives
me

<P>my meed liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective

<P>nature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have
no

<P>influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value

<P>it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is curious,' said I, 'it is so easy to be careful.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your
class this

<P>morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never

<P>seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned

<P>you. Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to

<P>Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I

<P>lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.

<P>Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear

<P>round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through

<P>Deepden, near our house;- then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I

<P>have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for

<P>listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet how well you replied this afternoon.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading
had

<P>interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was

<P>wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and

<P>unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity

<P>it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see
no

<P>farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able
to

<P>look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age

<P>was tending! Still, I like Charles- I respect him- I pity him, poor

<P>murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they

<P>had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could
not

<P>very well understand her- that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the

<P>subject she discussed. I recalled her to my level.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander
then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, certainly, not often: because Miss Temple has generally

<P>something to say which is newer than my own reflections; her

<P>language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she

<P>communicates is often just what I wished to gain.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination

<P>guides me. There is no merit in such goodness.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.
It is all

<P>I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to

<P>those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all

<P>their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never

<P>alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without
a

<P>reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should-
so

<P>hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older:
as yet you

<P>are but a little untaught girl.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever
I do to

<P>please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish

<P>me unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show

<P>me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians

<P>and civilised nations disown it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How? I don't understand.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not violence that best overcomes hate- nor vengeance
that

<P>most certainly heals injury.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says,
and how He

<P>acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does He say?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good
to them that

<P>hate you and despitefully use you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should
bless

<P>her son John, which is impossible.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded

<P>forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and

<P>resentments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt,

<P>without reserve or softening.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would
then make

<P>a remark, but she said nothing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' I asked impatiently, 'is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted,

<P>bad woman?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see,
she

<P>dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but

<P>how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you! What a

<P>singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your

<P>heart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not

<P>be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the

<P>passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be

<P>spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be,

<P>one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will

<P>soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our

<P>corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with

<P>this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will

<P>remain,- the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when

<P>it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will

<P>return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than

<P>man- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale

<P>human soul to brighten to the seraph! Surely it Will never, on the

<P>contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot

<P>believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and

<P>which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I

<P>cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest- a

<P>mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I

<P>can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can

<P>so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed

<P>revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply

<P>disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm,

<P>looking to the end.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she

<P>finished this sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk

<P>to me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not

<P>allowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl,

<P>presently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order,
and

<P>fold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and

<P>look at it!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed
the

<P>monitor without reply as without delay.
