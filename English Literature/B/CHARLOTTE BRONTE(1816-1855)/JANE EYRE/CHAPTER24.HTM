<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; AS I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened,
and

<P>wondered if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality

<P>till I had seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words

<P>of love and promise.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass,
and felt

<P>it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its

<P>colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of

<P>fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often

<P>been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he could not

<P>be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now,

<P>and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean

<P>and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no

<P>attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in

<P>so blissful a mood.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to
see that a

<P>brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night;

<P>and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and

<P>fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A

<P>beggar-woman and her little boy- pale, ragged objects both- were

<P>coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I

<P>happened to have in my purse- some three or four shillings: good or

<P>bad, they must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither

<P>birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing

<P>heart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window
with a sad

<P>countenance, and saying gravely- 'Miss Eyre, will you come to

<P>breakfast?' During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not

<P>undeceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations;

<P>and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I

<P>met Adele leaving the schoolroom.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you going? It is time for lessons.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is he?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In there,' pointing to the apartment she had left; and
I went

<P>in, and there he stood.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come and bid me good-morning,' said he. I gladly advanced;
and

<P>it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that

<P>I received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed

<P>genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,' said
he: 'truly

<P>pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my

<P>mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek

<P>and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel

<P>eyes?' (I had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for

<P>him they were new-dyed, I suppose.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is Jane Eyre, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Soon to be Jane Rochester,' he added: 'in four weeks,
Janet; not a

<P>day more. Do you hear that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me
giddy. The

<P>feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than

<P>was consistent with joy- something that smote and stunned: it was, I

<P>think, almost fear.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that
for?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you gave me a new name- Jane Rochester; and it
seems so

<P>strange.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Mrs. Rochester,' said he; 'young Mrs. Rochester-
Fairfax

<P>Rochester's girl-bride.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human
beings never

<P>enjoy complete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different

<P>destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling

<P>me is a fairy tale- a day-dream.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This
morning I

<P>wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his

<P>keeping,- heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I

<P>hope to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every

<P>attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if

<P>about to marry her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, sir!- never mind jewels! I don't like to hear them
spoken

<P>of. Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would

<P>rather not have them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and
the

<P>circlet on your forehead,- which it will become: for nature, at least,

<P>has stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will

<P>clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like

<P>fingers with rings.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other
things,

<P>and in another strain. Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am

<P>your plain, Quakerish governess.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the
desire of

<P>my heart,- delicate and aerial.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,-
or you

<P>are sneering. For God's sake, don't be ironical!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,'
he went

<P>on, while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because

<P>I felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. 'I

<P>will attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her

<P>hair; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your
Jane Eyre

<P>any longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket- a jay in borrowed

<P>plumes. I would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in

<P>stage-trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't

<P>call you handsome, sir, though I love you most dearly: far too

<P>dearly to flatter you. Don't flatter me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.

<P>'This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you

<P>must choose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be

<P>married in four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the

<P>church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to

<P>town. After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions

<P>nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she

<P>shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she

<P>shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to

<P>value herself by just comparison with others.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I travel?- and with you, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence,
Venice,

<P>and Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden
by

<P>you: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.

<P>Ten years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate,

<P>and rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and

<P>cleaned, with a very angel as my comforter.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed at him as he said this. 'I am not an angel,'
I

<P>asserted; 'and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr.

<P>Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me-

<P>for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which

<P>I do not at all anticipate.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you anticipate of me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,-
a very

<P>little while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be

<P>capricious; and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to

<P>please you: but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like
me

<P>again,- like me, I say, not love me. I suppose your love will

<P>effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written
by

<P>men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's

<P>ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope

<P>never to become quite distasteful to my dear master.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like
you again,

<P>and yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only like, but

<P>love you- with truth, fervour, constancy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet are you not capricious, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very
devil

<P>when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts- when they open

<P>to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility,

<P>coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent

<P>tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but

<P>does not break- at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent-
I

<P>am ever tender and true.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did
you ever

<P>love such an one?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I love it now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to
your

<P>difficult standard?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you
master me-

<P>you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and

<P>while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends

<P>a thrill up my arm to my heart. I am influenced- conquered; and the

<P>influence is sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo

<P>has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane?

<P>What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was

<P>involuntary), I was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their

<P>charmers-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You were, you little elfish-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hush, sir! You don't talk very wisely just now; any more
than

<P>those gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married,

<P>they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for

<P>their softness as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you

<P>will answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit

<P>your convenience or pleasure to grant.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ask me something now, Janet- the least thing: I desire
to be

<P>entreated-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed I will sir; I have my petition all ready.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance,
I shall

<P>swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of

<P>me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels,
and

<P>don't crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace

<P>round that plain pocket-handkerchief you have there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I might as well "gild refined gold." I know it: your request
is

<P>granted then- for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to
my

<P>banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a

<P>gift to be withdrawn: try again.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity,

<P>which is much piqued on one point.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked disturbed. 'What? what?' he said hastily. 'Curiosity
is a

<P>dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord

<P>every request-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry
into,

<P>perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate?
Do

<P>you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I

<P>would much rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me

<P>from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having,
Jane;

<P>but for God's sake, don't desire a useless burden! Don't long for

<P>poison- don't turn out a downright Eve on my hands!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you
liked

<P>to be conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don't you

<P>think I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and

<P>coax and entreat- even cry and be sulky if necessary- for the sake

<P>of a mere essay of my power?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume,
and the game

<P>is up.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now!
Your

<P>eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead

<P>resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled,
"a

<P>blue-piled thunderloft." That will be your married look, sir, I

<P>suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If that will be your married look, I, as a Christian,
will soon

<P>give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But

<P>what had you to ask, thing,- out with it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness
a great

<P>deal better than flattery. I had rather be a thing than an angel. This

<P>is what I have to ask,- Why did you take such pains to make me believe

<P>you wished to marry Miss Ingram?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!' And now he unknit
his

<P>black brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if

<P>well pleased at seeing a danger averted. 'I think I may confess,' he

<P>continued, 'even although I should make you a little indignant,

<P>Jane- and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are

<P>indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you

<P>mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by

<P>the bye, it was you who made me the offer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir-
Miss

<P>Ingram?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished
to

<P>render you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew

<P>jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance
of

<P>that end.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Excellent! Now you are small- not one whit bigger than
the end

<P>of my little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous

<P>disgrace to act in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's

<P>feelings, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Her feelings are concentrated in one- pride; and that
needs

<P>humbling. Were you jealous, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting
to you to

<P>know that. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will

<P>not suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won't she feel forsaken and

<P>deserted?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Impossible!- when I told you how she, on the contrary,
deserted

<P>me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her

<P>flame in a moment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am
afraid

<P>your principles on some points are eccentric.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have
grown a

<P>little awry for want of attention.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that
has been

<P>vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the

<P>bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That you may, my good little girl: there is not another
being in

<P>the world has the same pure love for me as yourself- for I lay that

<P>pleasant unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I
loved him

<P>very much- more than I could trust myself to say- more than words

<P>had power to express.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ask something more,' he said presently; 'it is my delight
to be

<P>entreated, and to yield.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was again ready with my request. 'Communicate your intentions

<P>to Mrs. Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall,

<P>and she was shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again.

<P>It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,' he replied.
'I mean

<P>you to accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare

<P>for the drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding. Did

<P>she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered

<P>it well lost?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and
yours, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Station! station!- your station is in my heart, and on
the necks

<P>of those who would insult you, now or hereafter.- Go.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit
Mrs.

<P>Fairfax's parlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading

<P>her morning portion of Scripture- the Lesson for the day; her Bible

<P>lay open before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her

<P>occupation, suspended by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now

<P>forgotten: her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the

<P>surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she

<P>roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few

<P>words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was

<P>abandoned unfinished. She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and

<P>pushed her chair back from the table.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I feel so astonished,' she began, 'I hardly know what
to say to

<P>you, Miss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I

<P>half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have

<P>never happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been
in

<P>a doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come

<P>in and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by

<P>my name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is

<P>actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don't

<P>laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago,

<P>and said that in a month you would be his wife.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He has said the same thing to me,' I replied.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at me bewildered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all
the

<P>Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too,

<P>has always been called careful. He means to marry you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He tells me so.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they
had

<P>there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It passes me!' she continued; 'but no doubt it is true
since you

<P>say so. How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.

<P>Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and

<P>there are twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost

<P>be your father.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!' exclaimed I, nettled; 'he is
nothing

<P>like my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an

<P>instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men
at

<P>five-and-twenty.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it really for love he is going to marry you?' she asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the
tears rose

<P>to my eyes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sorry to grieve you,' pursued the widow; 'but you
are so

<P>young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on

<P>your guard. It is an old saying that "all is not gold that

<P>glitters"; and in this case I do fear there will be something found
to

<P>be different to what either you or I expect.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?- am I a monster?' I said: 'is it impossible that
Mr.

<P>Rochester should have a sincere affection for me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and
Mr.

<P>Rochester, I daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you

<P>were a sort of pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have

<P>been a little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to

<P>put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the

<P>possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps

<P>offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and

<P>sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself. Last night

<P>I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house,

<P>and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve

<P>o'clock, saw you come in with him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, never mind that now,' I interrupted impatiently;
'it is

<P>enough that all was right.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope all will be right in the end,' she said: 'but believe
me,

<P>you cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:

<P>distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not

<P>accustomed to marry their governesses.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let me go,- let me go to Millcote too!' she cried. 'Mr.

<P>Rochester won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg

<P>him to let me go, mademoiselle.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I will, Adele'; and I hastened away with her, glad
to quit my

<P>gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it

<P>round to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot

<P>following him backwards and forwards.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I told her no. I'll have no brats!- I'll have only you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would
be better.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not it: she will be a restraint.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill
of

<P>Mrs. Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me:

<P>something of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I

<P>half lost the sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to

<P>obey him, without further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the

<P>carriage, he looked at my face.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the matter?' he asked; 'all the sunshine is gone.
Do you

<P>really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would far rather she went, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!'

<P>cried he to Adele.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She obeyed him with what speed she might.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter

<P>much,' said he, 'when I mean shortly to claim you- your thoughts,

<P>conversation, and company- for life.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of
expressing

<P>her gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away

<P>into a corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where

<P>I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive; to him, in his

<P>present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask

<P>of him any information.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her come to me,' I entreated: 'she will, perhaps,
trouble you,

<P>sir: there is plenty of room on this side.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. 'I'll send
her to

<P>school yet,' he said, but now he was smiling.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school 'sans

<P>mademoiselle?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' he replied, 'absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I
am to

<P>take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one
of

<P>the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall

<P>live with me there, and only me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,' observed

<P>Adele.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains
and

<P>hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a
fire?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold,
I'll

<P>carry her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, qu'elle y sera mal- peu comfortable! And her clothes,
they

<P>will wear out: how can she get new ones?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. 'Hem!' said he.
'What

<P>would you do, Adele? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would

<P>a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could

<P>cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is far better as she is,' concluded Adele, after musing
some

<P>time: 'besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the

<P>moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has consented: she has pledged her word.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon:
it is

<P>all air; and neither you nor she can fly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele, look at that field.' We were now outside Thornfield

<P>gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where

<P>the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and where the low hedges

<P>and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and

<P>rain-refreshed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about
a

<P>fortnight since- the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in

<P>the orchard meadows; and as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down

<P>to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a

<P>pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago,

<P>and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast,

<P>though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the

<P>path and stopped two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little

<P>thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come

<P>near me; it stood soon at my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never

<P>spoke to me, in words; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and

<P>our speechless colloquy was to this effect-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its
errand

<P>was to make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a

<P>lonely place- such as the moon, for instance- and it nodded its head

<P>towards her horn, rising over Hayhill: it told me of the alabaster

<P>cave and silver vale where we might live. I said I should like to

<P>go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Oh," returned the fairy, "that does not signify! Here
is a

<P>talisman will remove all difficulties"; and she held out a pretty gold

<P>ring. "Put it," she said, "on the fourth finger of my left hand, and
I

<P>am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own

<P>heaven yonder." She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adele, is in

<P>my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon

<P>to change it to a ring again.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don't care
for the

<P>fairy: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mademoiselle is a fairy,' he said, whispering mysteriously.

<P>Whereupon I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part,

<P>evinced a fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr.

<P>Rochester 'un vrai menteur,' and assuring him that she made no account

<P>whatever of his 'contes de fee,' and that 'du reste, il n'y avait

<P>pas de fees, et quand meme il y en avait': she was sure they would

<P>never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with

<P>him in the moon.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one
to me.

<P>Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I

<P>was ordered to choose half a dozen dresses. I hated the business, I

<P>begged leave to defer it: no- it should be gone through with now. By

<P>dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the

<P>half-dozen to two: these, however, he vowed he would select himself.

<P>With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on
a

<P>rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.

<P>I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me
a

<P>gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never

<P>venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was

<P>stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour

<P>of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk. 'It might pass for the

<P>present,' he said; 'but he would yet see me glittering like a

<P>parterre.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then
out of

<P>a jeweller's shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned

<P>with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the

<P>carriage, and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in

<P>the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten- the

<P>letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt
me

<P>and make me his legatee. 'It would, indeed, be a relief,' I thought,

<P>'if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being

<P>dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae

<P>with the golden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira

<P>the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be

<P>married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing

<P>Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be

<P>kept by him now.' And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed

<P>not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my master's and

<P>lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted

<P>both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a

<P>sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his

<P>gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting

<P>mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate

<P>pressure.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need not look in that way,' I said; 'if you do, I'll
wear

<P>nothing but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I'll be

<P>married in this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for

<P>yourself out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of

<P>waistcoats out of the black satin.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He chuckled; he rubbed his hands. 'Oh, it is rich to see
and hear

<P>her!' he exclaimed. 'Is she original? Is she piquant? I would not

<P>exchange this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole

<P>seraglio, gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eastern allusion bit me again. 'I'll not stand you
an inch in

<P>the stead of a seraglio,' I said; 'so don't consider me an

<P>equivalent for one. If you have a fancy for anything in that line,

<P>away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and

<P>lay out in extensive slave-purchases some of that spare cash you

<P>seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for
so many

<P>tons of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to
preach

<P>liberty to them that are enslaved- your harem inmates amongst the

<P>rest. I'll get admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you,

<P>three-tailed bashaw as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself

<P>fettered amongst our hands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your

<P>bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot

<P>ever yet conferred.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated
for it

<P>with an eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that

<P>whatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act,

<P>when released, would be to violate its conditions.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel
me to go

<P>through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the

<P>altar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms- what will they

<P>be?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded
obligations.

<P>Do you remember what you said of Celine Varens?- of the diamonds,

<P>the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Celine

<P>Varens. I shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I

<P>shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.

<P>I'll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give

<P>me nothing but-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, but what?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt
will be

<P>quit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride,
you haven't

<P>your equal,' said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. 'Will it

<P>please you to dine with me to-day?' he asked, as we re-entered the

<P>gates.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, thank you, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what for, "no, thank you?" if one may inquire.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason
why I should

<P>now: till-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Till what? You delight in half-phrases.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Till I can't help it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you
dread being

<P>the companion of my repast?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but
I want to go

<P>on as usual for another month.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will give up your governessing slavery at once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall
just go

<P>on with it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have

<P>been accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you

<P>feel disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort
me under all

<P>this, "pour me donner une contenance," as Adele would say; and

<P>unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case nor my snuff-box. But

<P>listen- whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be

<P>mine presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and
to

<P>hold, I'll just- figuratively speaking- attach you to a chain like

<P>this' (touching his watch-guard). 'Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you

<P>in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage,
and while

<P>he afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good

<P>my retreat upstairs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had

<P>prepared an occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend

<P>the whole time in a tete-a-tete conversation. I remembered his fine

<P>voice; I knew he liked to sing- good singers generally do. I was no

<P>vocalist myself, and, in his fastidious judgment, no musician, either;

<P>but I delighted in listening when the performance was good. No

<P>sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower her blue and

<P>starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and

<P>entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song. He said I

<P>was a capricious witch, and that he would rather sing another time;

<P>but I averred that no time was like the present.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did I like his voice?' he asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very much.' I was not fond of pampering that susceptible
vanity of

<P>his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe

<P>and stimulate it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well, sir, I will try.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated
'a

<P>little bungler.' Being pushed unceremoniously to one side- which was

<P>precisely what I wished- he usurped my place, and proceeded to

<P>accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the

<P>window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees

<P>and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following

<P>strain:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'The truest love that ever heart

Felt at its kindled core,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did through each vein, in quickened start,

The tide of being pour.

Her coming was my hope each day,

Her parting was my pain;

The chance that did her steps delay

Was ice in every vein.

I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,

As blind as eagerly.

That lay our lives between,

Of ocean-surges green.

On sped my rainbow, fast as light;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled,
and

<P>his full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every

<P>lineament. I quailed momentarily- then I rallied. Soft scene, daring

<P>demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a

<P>weapon of defence must be prepared- I whetted my tongue: as he reached

<P>me, I asked with asperity, 'whom he was going to marry now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one:
he had

<P>talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a

<P>pagan idea? I had no intention of dying with him- he might depend on

<P>that.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might
live with

<P>him! Death was not for such as I.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time
came as

<P>he had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a

<P>suttee.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my
pardon by a

<P>reconciling kiss?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: I would rather be excused.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I heard myself apostrophised as a 'hard little thing';
and

<P>it was added, 'any other woman would have been melted to marrow at

<P>hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assured him I was naturally hard- very flinty, and that
he

<P>would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show

<P>him divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks

<P>elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made,

<P>while there was yet time to rescind it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would I be quiet and talk rationally?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally,
I

<P>flattered myself I was doing that now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He fretted, pished, and pshawed. 'Very good,' I thought;
'you may

<P>fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue

<P>with you, I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I'll not

<P>sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll

<P>keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its

<P>pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our

<P>real mutual advantage.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation;

<P>then, after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of

<P>the room, I got up, and saying, 'I wish you good-night, sir,' in my

<P>natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door

<P>and got away.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole
season of

<P>probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure,

<P>rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was

<P>excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and

<P>turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would

<P>have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common sense, and even suited

<P>his taste less.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential
and

<P>quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in

<P>the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He

<P>continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven;

<P>though when I appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms
as

<P>'love' and 'darling' on his lips: the best words at my service were

<P>'provoking puppet,' 'malicious elf,' 'sprite,' 'changeling,' etc.

<P>For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a

<P>pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the

<P>ear. It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce

<P>favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her

<P>anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well.

<P>Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone,

<P>and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period

<P>fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. 'I can keep you
in

<P>reasonable check now,' I reflected; 'and I don't doubt to be able to

<P>do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be

<P>devised.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would
rather

<P>have pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me

<P>my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.

<P>He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse

<P>intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those

<P>days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.
