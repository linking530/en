<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESENTIMENTS are strange things! and so are sympathies;
and so are

<P>signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has

<P>not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life,

<P>because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe,

<P>exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly

<P>estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the

<P>unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings

<P>baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be

<P>but the sympathies of Nature with man.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night
heard

<P>Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a

<P>little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of

<P>trouble, either to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn

<P>out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which

<P>served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for

<P>home to the deathbed of her little sister.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident;
for

<P>during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that

<P>had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed

<P>in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing

<P>with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.

<P>It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now
it

<P>nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the

<P>apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven

<P>successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not like this iteration of one idea- this strange

<P>recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached

<P>and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with

<P>this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I

<P>heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I

<P>was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs.

<P>Fairfax's room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me,

<P>having the appearance of a gentleman's servant: he was dressed in deep

<P>mourning, and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a

<P>crape band.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,' he said, rising
as I

<P>entered; 'but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed

<P>when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live

<P>there still.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you
used to

<P>give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how is

<P>Bessie? You are married to Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought
me

<P>another little one about two months since- we have three now- and both

<P>mother and child are thriving.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And are the family well at the house, Robert?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss:
they are

<P>very badly at present- in great trouble.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope no one is dead,' I said, glancing at his black
dress. He

<P>too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in
London.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. John?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how does his mother bear it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his
life has

<P>been very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange

<P>ways, and his death was shocking.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Doing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health
and his

<P>estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and

<P>into jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free

<P>he returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong:

<P>the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.

<P>He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to

<P>give up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much

<P>reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next

<P>news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!- they say he killed

<P>himself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven
resumed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she
had got

<P>very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear

<P>of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr.

<P>John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a

<P>stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she

<P>seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say

<P>something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was

<P>only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was

<P>pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, "Bring

<P>Jane- fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her." Bessie is not sure

<P>whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words;

<P>but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send

<P>for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew

<P>so restless, and said, "Jane, Jane," so many times, that at last

<P>they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get

<P>ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow

<P>morning.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought
to go.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would
not

<P>refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get

<P>off?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; and I will do it now'; and having directed him to
the

<P>servants' hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and

<P>the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the
yard, the

<P>stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;-

<P>yes: she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the

<P>billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices

<P>resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton,

<P>and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some

<P>courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one

<P>I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss

<P>Ingram's side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me

<P>haughtily: her eyes seemed to demand, 'What can the creeping

<P>creature want now?' and when I said, in a low voice, 'Mr.

<P>Rochester,' she made a movement as if tempted to order me away. I

<P>remember her appearance at the moment- it was very graceful and very

<P>striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure

<P>scarf was twisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the

<P>game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her

<P>haughty lineaments.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does that person want you?' she inquired of Mr. Rochester;
and Mr.

<P>Rochester turned to see who the 'person' was. He made a curious

<P>grimace- one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations- threw down

<P>his cue and followed me from the room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane?' he said, as he rested his back against the

<P>school-room door, which he had shut.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week
or two.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What to do?- where to go?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To see a sick lady who has sent for me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What sick lady?- where does she live?'

<P>for people to see her that distance?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Her name is Reed sir- Mrs. Reed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is his widow, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Reed was my uncle- my mother's brother.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always
said

<P>you had no relations.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his
wife cast

<P>me off.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But Reed left children?- you must have cousins? Sir George
Lynn

<P>was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one
of

<P>the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana

<P>Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season

<P>or two ago in London.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined
his

<P>family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked

<P>his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would
never

<P>think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps,

<P>be dead before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances
were

<P>very different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long will you stay?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As short a time as possible, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Promise me only to stay a week-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break
it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At all events you will come back: you will not be induced
under

<P>any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And who goes with you? You don't travel a hundred miles
alone.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, she has sent her coachman.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A person to be trusted?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester meditated. 'When do you wish to go?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Early to-morrow morning, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without
money,

<P>and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How

<P>much have you in the world, Jane?' he asked, smiling.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. 'Five shillings,

<P>sir.' He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and

<P>chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his

<P>pocket-book: 'Here,' said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds,

<P>and he owed me but fifteen. I told him I had no change.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't want change; you know that. Take your wages.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at
first;

<P>then, as if recollecting something, he said-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would,
perhaps,

<P>stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it

<P>not plenty?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of
business to

<P>you while I have the opportunity.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going
shortly

<P>to be married?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; what then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure
you will

<P>perceive the necessity of it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise
walk over

<P>her rather too emphatically? There's sense in the suggestion; not a

<P>doubt of it. Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course,

<P>must march straight to- the devil?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In course!' he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a
distortion

<P>of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some

<P>minutes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will
be

<P>solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would
justify

<P>me in asking favours of them- but I shall advertise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!' he growled.
'At your

<P>peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead

<P>of ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so have I, sir,' I returned, putting my hands and
my purse

<P>behind me. 'I could not spare the money on any account.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Little niggard!' said he, 'refusing me a pecuniary request!
Give

<P>me five pounds, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just let me look at the cash.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; you are not to be trusted.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Promise me one thing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely
to

<P>perform.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation
to me.

<P>I'll find you one in time.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will

<P>promise that I and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before

<P>your bride enters it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well! very well! I'll pledge my word on it. You go
to-morrow,

<P>then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir; early.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose so, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?
Teach

<P>me; I'm not quite up to it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then say it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What must I say?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The same, if you like, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.
I

<P>should like something else: a little addition to the rite. If one

<P>shook hands, for instance; but no- that would not content me either.

<P>So you'll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in
one hearty

<P>word as in many.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very likely; but it is blank and cool- "Farewell."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long is he going to stand with his back against that
door?'

<P>I asked myself; 'I want to commence my packing.' The dinner-bell rang,

<P>and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no

<P>more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in
the

<P>afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to

<P>the hall. It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung

<P>with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and

<P>fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat

<P>on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played

<P>quietly in a corner.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bless you!- I knew you would come!' exclaimed Mrs. Leaven,
as I

<P>entered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Bessie,' said I, after I had kissed her; 'and I trust
I am

<P>not too late. How is Mrs. Reed?- Alive still, I hope.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than
she was.

<P>The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks

<P>she will finally recover.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Has she mentioned me lately?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing
you would

<P>come: but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up

<P>at the house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the

<P>afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself

<P>here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child
in the

<P>cradle and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking

<P>off my bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and

<P>tired. I was glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be

<P>relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let

<P>her undress me when a child.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling

<P>about- setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and

<P>butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert

<P>or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in

<P>former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light

<P>foot and good looks.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired
me to

<P>sit still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at

<P>the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round

<P>stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to

<P>accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery

<P>chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and
what sort

<P>of a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a

<P>master, whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told

<P>her he was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he

<P>treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to

<P>her the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and

<P>to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely
of

<P>the kind she relished.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored
to me

<P>my bonnet, etc., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for

<P>the hall. It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years

<P>ago, walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw

<P>morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and

<P>embittered heart- a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation- to

<P>seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and

<P>unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my

<P>prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still

<P>felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced

<P>firmer trust in myself and my own powers, and less withering dread

<P>of oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite

<P>healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall go into the breakfast-room first,' said Bessie,
as she

<P>preceded me through the hall; 'the young ladies will be there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In another moment I was within that apartment. There was
every

<P>article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first

<P>introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still

<P>covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could

<P>distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying

<P>their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the

<P>Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not

<P>changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost
as

<P>tall as Miss Ingram- very thin too, with a sallow face and severe

<P>mien. There was something ascetic in her look, was augmented by the

<P>extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a

<P>starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the

<P>nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I

<P>felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her

<P>former self in that elongated and colourless visage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana
I

<P>remembered- the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a

<P>full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and

<P>regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.

<P>The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different

<P>from her sister's- so much more flowing and becoming- it looked as

<P>stylish as the other's looked puritanical.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother-
and

<P>only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's

<P>Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour

<P>of jaw and chin- perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an

<P>indescribable hardness to the countenance, otherwise so voluptuous and

<P>buxom.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both

<P>addressed me by the name of 'Miss Eyre.' Eliza's greeting was

<P>delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she

<P>sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.

<P>Georgiana added to her 'How d 'ye do?' several commonplaces about my

<P>journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone:

<P>and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to

<P>foot-now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now

<P>lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies

<P>have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a 'quiz'

<P>without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look,

<P>coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their

<P>sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive

<P>rudeness in word or deed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer
that

<P>power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was

<P>surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one

<P>and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other- Eliza did not mortify,

<P>nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think

<P>about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so

<P>much more potent than any they could raise- pains and pleasures so

<P>much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in

<P>their power to inflict or bestow- that their airs gave me no concern

<P>either for good or bad.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How is Mrs. Reed?' I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana,

<P>who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an

<P>unexpected liberty.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Reed? Ah, mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly:
I doubt if

<P>you can see her to-night.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If,' said I, 'you would just step upstairs and tell her
I am come,

<P>I should be much obliged to you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes
wild and

<P>wide. 'I know she had a particular wish to see me,' I added, 'and I

<P>would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely

<P>necessary.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,' remarked
Eliza. I

<P>soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and

<P>said I would just step out to Bessie- who was, I dared say, in the

<P>kitchen- and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to

<P>receive me or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and

<P>despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures.

<P>It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance:

<P>received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved

<P>to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me

<P>all at once that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey

<P>of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she

<P>was better- or dead: as to her daughters' pride or folly, I must put

<P>it on one side, make myself independent of it. So I addressed the

<P>housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably

<P>be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my

<P>chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Missis is awake,' said she; 'I have told her you are here:
come

<P>and let us see if she will know you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to
which I

<P>had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former

<P>days. I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded

<P>light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the

<P>great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the

<P>toilet-table, the arm-chair, and the footstool, at which I had a

<P>hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by

<P>me uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half expecting
to

<P>see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk

<P>there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or

<P>shrinking neck. I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and

<P>leant over the high-piled pillows.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought
the

<P>familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of

<P>vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left

<P>this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with

<P>no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a

<P>strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries- to be reconciled

<P>and clasp hands in amity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever-
there was

<P>that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,

<P>imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and

<P>hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows

<P>revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and

<P>kissed her: she looked at me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is this Jane Eyre?' she said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again:
I

<P>thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had

<P>fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine

<P>kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But

<P>unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural

<P>antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away,

<P>and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night

<P>was warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her

<P>opinion of me- her feeling towards me- was unchanged and unchangeable.

<P>I knew by her stony eye- opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to

<P>tears- that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because

<P>to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense

<P>of mortification.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination

<P>to subdue her- to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and

<P>her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them

<P>back to their source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down

<P>and leaned over the pillow.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You sent for me,' I said, 'and I am here; and it is my
intention

<P>to stay till I see how you get on.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can
talk some

<P>things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and
I

<P>have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I

<P>wished to say- let me see-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck
had

<P>taken place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew

<P>the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the

<P>quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit up!' said she; 'don't annoy me with holding the clothes

<P>fast. Are you Jane Eyre?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am Jane Eyre.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have had more trouble with that child than any one would

<P>believe. Such a burden to be left on my hands- and so much annoyance

<P>as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible

<P>disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual,

<P>unnatural watchings of one's movements! I declare she talked to me

<P>once like something mad, or like a fiend- no child ever spoke or

<P>looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did

<P>they do with her at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the

<P>pupils died. She, however, did not die: but I said she did- I wish she

<P>had died!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's

<P>only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's

<P>disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of

<P>her death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby;

<P>though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its

<P>maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it- a

<P>sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night

<P>long- not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering

<P>and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it

<P>as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his

<P>own at that age. He would try to make my children friendly to the

<P>little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with

<P>them when they showed their dislike. In his last illness, he had it

<P>brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died,
he

<P>bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been

<P>charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak,

<P>naturally weak. John does not at all resemble his father, and I am

<P>glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers- he is quite a

<P>Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for

<P>money! I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor. I must

<P>send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it

<P>off. I can never submit to do that- yet how are we to get on?

<P>Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John

<P>gambles dreadfully, and always loses- poor boy! He is beset by

<P>sharpers: John is sunk and degraded- his look is frightful- I feel

<P>ashamed for him when I see him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was getting much excited. 'I think I had better leave
her now,'

<P>said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way
towards

<P>night- in the morning she is calmer.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose. 'Stop!' exclaimed Mrs. Reed, 'there is another
thing I

<P>wished to say. He threatens me- he continually threatens me with his

<P>own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with

<P>a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I

<P>am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be

<P>done? How is the money to be had?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative

<P>draught: she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew

<P>more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation
with

<P>her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor

<P>forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got

<P>on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold,

<P>indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or

<P>writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.

<P>Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and

<P>take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for

<P>occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me,

<P>and they served me for both.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper,
I used

<P>to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in

<P>sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened

<P>momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of

<P>imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon,

<P>and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and

<P>a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf

<P>sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a
face it

<P>was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave
it

<P>a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad

<P>and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that

<P>contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it

<P>with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced

<P>under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with
a

<P>straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by
no

<P>means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle

<P>of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty

<P>hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the

<P>eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most

<P>careful working. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the

<P>eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large.

<P>'Good! but not quite the thing,' I thought, as I surveyed the

<P>effect: 'they want more force and spirit'; and I wrought the shades

<P>blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly- a happy touch

<P>or two secured success. There, I had a friend's face under my gaze;

<P>and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs

<P>on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was

<P>absorbed and content.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that a portrait of some one you know?' asked Eliza,
who had

<P>approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy

<P>head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it

<P>was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But

<P>what was that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also

<P>advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much, but she

<P>called that 'an ugly man.' They both seemed surprised at my skill. I

<P>offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil

<P>outline. Then Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute
a

<P>water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour. She

<P>proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we

<P>were deep in a confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a

<P>description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two

<P>seasons ago- of the admiration she had there excited- the attention

<P>she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she

<P>had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints

<P>were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and

<P>sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel

<P>of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit. The

<P>communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the

<P>same theme- herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she never

<P>once adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's

<P>death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind

<P>seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and

<P>aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed about five

<P>minutes each day in her mother's sick-room, and no more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to
talk. I

<P>never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was

<P>difficult to say what she did: or rather, to discover any result of

<P>her diligence. She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how

<P>she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided

<P>her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task.

<P>Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on

<P>inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the

<P>great attraction of that volume, and she said, 'the Rubric.' Three

<P>hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a

<P>square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to

<P>my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it was a

<P>covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near

<P>Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by

<P>herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her

<P>accounts. She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe

<P>she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing

<P>annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her

<P>to vary its clockwork regularity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative

<P>than usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the

<P>family, had been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had

<P>now, she said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own

<P>fortune she had taken care to secure; and when her mother died- and
it

<P>was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either

<P>recover or linger long- she would execute a long-cherished project:

<P>seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured

<P>from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a

<P>frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common:
they never

<P>had had. She would not be burdened with her society for any

<P>consideration. Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza,

<P>would take hers.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent
most of

<P>her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the

<P>house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send

<P>her an invitation up to town. 'It would be so much better,' she

<P>said, 'if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till

<P>all was over.' I did not ask what she meant by 'all being over,' but
I

<P>suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the

<P>gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice
of

<P>her sister's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring,

<P>lounging object had been before her. One day, however, as she put away

<P>her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her
up

<P>thus-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was
certainly

<P>never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for

<P>you make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself,

<P>as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness

<P>on some other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to

<P>burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you

<P>cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too,

<P>existence for you must be a scene of continual change and

<P>excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you

<P>must be courted, you must be flattered- you must have music,

<P>dancing, and society- or you languish, you die away. Have you no sense

<P>to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and

<P>all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into sections; to each

<P>section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an

<P>hour, ten minutes, five minutes- include all; do each piece of

<P>business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day

<P>will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are

<P>indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment:

<P>you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy

<P>forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought

<P>to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then

<P>you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it-

<P>go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling- and suffer the

<P>results of your idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I

<P>tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat

<P>what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my

<P>mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is

<P>carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as

<P>separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think

<P>that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer

<P>you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this-

<P>if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we

<P>two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world,

<P>and betake myself to the new.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She closed her lips.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering
that

<P>tirade,' answered Georgiana. 'Everybody knows you are the most

<P>selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful

<P>hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you

<P>played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised

<P>above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare

<P>not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and

<P>ruined my prospects for ever.' Georgiana took out her handkerchief and

<P>blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassible,

<P>and assiduously industrious.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; True, generous feeling is made small account of by some,
but here

<P>were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other

<P>despicably savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment

<P>is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too

<P>bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen
asleep on

<P>the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a

<P>saint's-day service at the new church- for in matters of religion

<P>she was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual

<P>discharge of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or

<P>foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on

<P>week-days as there were prayers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying
woman sped,

<P>who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a

<P>remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would

<P>slip out of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but

<P>she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to

<P>the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse

<P>was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid

<P>face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed

<P>the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could

<P>not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew

<P>tempestuously: 'One lies there,' I thought, 'who will soon be beyond

<P>the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit- now

<P>struggling to quit its material tenement- flit when at length

<P>released?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns,

<P>recalled her dying words- her faith- her doctrine of the equality of

<P>disembodied souls. I was still listening in thought to her

<P>well-remembered tones- still picturing her pale and spiritual

<P>aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid

<P>deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine

<P>Father's bosom- when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind:

<P>'Who is that?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?
I

<P>went up to her.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is I, Aunt Reed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who- I?' was her answer. 'Who are you?' looking at me
with

<P>surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. 'You are quite a

<P>stranger to me- where is Bessie?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is at the lodge, aunt.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aunt,' she repeated. 'Who calls me aunt? You are not one
of the

<P>Gibsons; and yet I know you- that face, and the eyes and forehead, are

<P>quite familiar to me: you are like- why, you are like Jane Eyre!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock
by declaring

<P>my identity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet,' said she, 'I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts

<P>deceive me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where

<P>none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed.' I now

<P>gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me

<P>to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were

<P>quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to

<P>fetch me from Thornfield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very ill, I know,' she said ere long. 'I was trying
to turn

<P>myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as

<P>well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in

<P>health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the

<P>nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assured her we were alone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.
One was in

<P>breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own

<P>child; the other-' she stopped. 'After all, it is of no great

<P>importance, perhaps,' she murmured to herself: 'and then I may get

<P>better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her
face

<P>changed; she seemed to experience some inward sensation- the

<P>precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had
better tell

<P>her.- Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you

<P>will see there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed her directions. 'Read the letter,' she said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was short, and thus conceived:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'MADAM,- Will you have the goodness to send me the address
of my

<P>niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to

<P>write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence

<P>has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am

<P>unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and

<P>bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.- I am, Madam,

<P>etc., etc.,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'JOHN EYRE, Madeira.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was dated three years back.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why did I never hear of this?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever
to lend a

<P>hand in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct

<P>to me, Jane- the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in

<P>which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the

<P>world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the

<P>very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated

<P>you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations

<P>when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt

<P>fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me

<P>with human eyes and cursed me in a man's voice.- Bring me some

<P>water! Oh, make haste!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear Mrs. Reed,' said I, as I offered her the draught
she

<P>required, 'think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.

<P>Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine

<P>years have passed since that day.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted
the

<P>water and drawn breath, she went on thus-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge:
for you

<P>to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and

<P>comfort, was what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was

<P>sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died

<P>of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict

<P>my assertion- expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were

<P>born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the

<P>recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been

<P>tempted to commit.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it,
aunt, and to

<P>regard me with kindness and forgiveness-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have a very bad disposition,' said she, 'and one to
this day I

<P>feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be

<P>patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break

<P>out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate,
but

<P>not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been

<P>glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to

<P>be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch
it. She said

<P>I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.

<P>As I laid her down- for I raised her and supported her on my arm while

<P>she drank- I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the

<P>feeble fingers shrank from my touch- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last,
'you have

<P>my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make
now the

<P>effort to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever

<P>hated me- dying, she must hate me still.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered
half

<P>an hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.

<P>She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at

<P>twelve o'clock that night she died. I was not present to close her

<P>eyes, nor were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the

<P>next morning that all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza

<P>and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud

<P>weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed's

<P>once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was

<P>covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the

<P>impress of her inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that

<P>corpse to me. I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing

<P>sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only
a

<P>grating anguish for her woes- not my loss- and a sombre tearless

<P>dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some
minutes

<P>she observed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With her constitution she should have lived to a good
old age: her

<P>life was shortened by trouble.' And then a spasm constricted her mouth

<P>for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and
so

<P>did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.
