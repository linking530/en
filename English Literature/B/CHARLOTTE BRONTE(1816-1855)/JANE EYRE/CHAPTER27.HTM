<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; SOME time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking
round

<P>and seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the

<P>wall, I asked, 'What am I to do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the answer my mind gave- 'Leave Thornfield at once'-
was so

<P>prompt, so dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such

<P>words now. 'That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part

<P>of my woe,' I alleged: 'that I have wakened out of most glorious

<P>dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and

<P>master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is

<P>intolerable. I cannot do it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it
and

<P>foretold that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I

<P>wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further

<P>suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held

<P>Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her

<P>dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he

<P>would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let me be torn away, then!' I cried. 'Let another help
me!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you:
you shall

<P>yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:

<P>your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which
so ruthless

<P>a judge haunted,- at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My

<P>head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from

<P>excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips

<P>that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I

<P>now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had

<P>been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even

<P>little Adele had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had

<P>sought me. 'Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,' I

<P>murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an

<P>obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were

<P>feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I fell, but not on to the

<P>ground; an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up- I was supported
by

<P>Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You come out at last,' he said. 'Well, I have been waiting
for you

<P>long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:

<P>five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced

<P>the lock like a burglar. So you shun me?- you shut yourself up and

<P>grieve alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with

<P>vehemence. You are passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I

<P>was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be

<P>shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your

<P>drenched handkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a

<P>white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then,

<P>your heart has been weeping blood?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter- nothing

<P>poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly

<P>where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who
had but

<P>one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of

<P>his bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some

<P>mistake slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his

<P>bloody blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There
was such

<P>deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy

<P>in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole

<P>look and mien- I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly;

<P>only at my heart's core.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?' ere long he inquired

<P>wistfully- wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,

<P>the result rather of weakness than of will.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then tell me so roundly and sharply- don't spare me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.' He
heaved a

<P>sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me

<P>downstairs. At first I did not know to what room he had borne me;

<P>all was cloudy to my glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving

<P>warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my

<P>chamber. He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate

<P>something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the library-

<P>sitting in his chair- he was quite near. 'If I could go out of life

<P>now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,' I thought;

<P>'then I should not have to make the effort of cracking my

<P>heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's. I must leave

<P>him, it appears. I do not want to leave him- I cannot leave him.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How are you now, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Taste the wine again, Jane.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood
before

<P>me, and looked at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an

<P>inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind;

<P>he walked fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me

<P>as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I

<P>turned my face away and put his aside.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What!- How is this?' he exclaimed hastily. 'Oh, I know!
you

<P>won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled

<P>and my embraces appropriated?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking;
I will

<P>answer for you- Because I have a wife already, you would reply.- I

<P>guess rightly?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me;
you must

<P>regard me as a plotting profligate- a base and low rake who has been

<P>simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare

<P>deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of

<P>self-respect. What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing: in

<P>the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw

<P>your breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself

<P>to accuse and revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are

<P>opened, and they would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no

<P>desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking

<P>how to act- talking you consider is of no use. I know you- I am on

<P>my guard.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, I do not wish to act against you,' I said; and my
unsteady

<P>voice warned me to curtail my sentence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming
to

<P>destroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man- as a

<P>married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have

<P>refused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger
to

<P>me: to live under this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say
a

<P>friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again
to

<P>me, you will say,- "That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must

<P>be ice and rock to him"; and ice and rock you will accordingly

<P>become.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: 'All is changed
about me,

<P>sir; I must change too- there is no doubt of that; and to avoid

<P>fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections

<P>and associations, there is only one way- Adele must have a new

<P>governess, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Adele will go to school- I have settled that already;
nor do I

<P>mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections
of

<P>Thornfield Hall- this accursed place- this tent of Achan- this

<P>insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the

<P>light of the open sky- this narrow stone hell, with its one real

<P>fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine. Jane, you shall

<P>not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield

<P>Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal

<P>from you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the

<P>place; merely because I feared Adele never would have a governess to

<P>stay if she knew with what inmate she was housed, and my plans would

<P>not permit me to remove the maniac elsewhere- though I possess an

<P>old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this,

<P>where I could have lodged her safely enough, had not a scruple about

<P>the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made my

<P>conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls

<P>would soon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own

<P>vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect assassination, even of

<P>what I most hate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however,
was

<P>something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near
a

<P>upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I'll

<P>shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the

<P>lower windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here

<P>with my wife, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for

<P>money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to

<P>bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when

<P>my wife is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at

<P>night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir,' I interrupted him, 'you are inexorable for that

<P>unfortunate lady: you speak of her with hate- with vindictive

<P>antipathy. It is cruel- she cannot help being mad.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you
are),

<P>you don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it

<P>is not because she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think

<P>I should hate you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do indeed, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me,
and

<P>nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of

<P>your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would

<P>still be dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it

<P>would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine

<P>you, and not a strait waistcoat- your grasp, even in fury, would

<P>have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did

<P>this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond

<P>as it would be restrictive. I should not shrink from you with

<P>disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no

<P>watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring

<P>tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary

<P>of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of

<P>recognition for me.- But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was

<P>talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared

<P>for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure

<P>one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its

<P>miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which will

<P>be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome

<P>intrusion- even from falsehood and slander.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And take Adele with you, sir,' I interrupted; 'she will
be a

<P>companion for you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adele
to school;

<P>and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own

<P>child,- a French dancer's bastard? Why do you importune me about

<P>her! I say, why do you assign Adele to me for a companion?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude
are

<P>dull: too dull for you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Solitude! solitude!' he reiterated with irritation. 'I
see I

<P>must come to an explanation. I don't know what sphynx-like

<P>expression is forming in your countenance. You are to share my

<P>solitude. Do you understand?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited
as he was

<P>becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been

<P>walking fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted

<P>to one spot. He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him,

<P>fixed them on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet,

<P>collected aspect.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now for the hitch in Jane's character,' he said at last,

<P>speaking more calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.

<P>'The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew

<P>there would come a knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation,

<P>and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a

<P>fraction of Samson's strength, and break the entanglement like tow!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this
time just

<P>before me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! will you hear reason?' (he stooped and approached
his lips

<P>to my ear); 'because, if you won't, I'll try violence. His voice was

<P>hoarse; his look that of a man who is just about to burst an

<P>insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that
in

<P>another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be

<P>able to do nothing with him. The present- the passing second of

<P>time- was all I had in which to control and restrain him: a movement

<P>of repulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom,- and his. But

<P>I was not afraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense
of

<P>influence, which supported me. The crisis was perilous; but not

<P>without its charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips

<P>over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold of his clenched hand,

<P>loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him, soothingly-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear
all you

<P>have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.
I had been

<P>struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to

<P>repress them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now,

<P>however, I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long

<P>as they liked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave

<P>way and cried heartily.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.
I said I

<P>could not while he was in such a passion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and
you had

<P>steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I

<P>could not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I,
in my turn,

<P>became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder,

<P>but I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! Jane!' he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness
it

<P>thrilled along every nerve I had; 'you don't love me, then? It was

<P>only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that

<P>you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my

<P>touch as if I were some toad or ape.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These words cut me: yet what could I do or say? I ought
probably to

<P>have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse

<P>at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop

<P>balm where I had wounded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do love you,' I said, 'more than ever: but I must not
show or

<P>indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with
me,

<P>and see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and

<P>distant?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore
I see

<P>there is but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth
your hair-

<P>which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face- which looks

<P>feverish?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must leave Adele and Thornfield. I must part with you
for my

<P>whole life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and

<P>strange scenes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness
about

<P>parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the

<P>new existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not

<P>married. You shall be Mrs. Rochester- both virtually and nominally.

<P>I shall keep only to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to

<P>a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the

<P>shores of the Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and

<P>guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you

<P>into error- to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head?

<P>Jane, you must be reasonable, or in truth I shall again become

<P>frantic.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated;
his eye

<P>blazed: still I dared to speak.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged
this morning

<P>by yourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be

<P>your mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical- is false.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man- you forget that:
I am not

<P>long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me

<P>and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and-

<P>beware!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was
forsaking

<P>his cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all

<P>hands. To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was

<P>cruel: to yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do

<P>instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity- looked for

<P>aid to one higher than man: the words 'God help me!' burst

<P>involuntarily from my lips.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am a fool!' cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. 'I keep telling
her

<P>I am not married, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows

<P>nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances

<P>attending my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree

<P>with me in opinion, when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand

<P>in mine, Janet- that I may have the evidence of touch as well as

<P>sight, to prove you are near me- and I will in a few words show you

<P>the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir; for hours if you will.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that
I was not

<P>the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious,
grasping

<P>man?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have understood something to that effect.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the
property

<P>together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and

<P>leaving me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my

<P>brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he endure that a son of his

<P>should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.
He

<P>sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and

<P>merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions

<P>were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a

<P>son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give

<P>the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When

<P>I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride

<P>already courted for me. My father said nothing about her money; but
he

<P>told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her beauty: and

<P>this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche

<P>Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to secure me

<P>because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me
in

<P>parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very

<P>little private conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly

<P>displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the

<P>men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me. I was dazzled,

<P>stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and

<P>inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no folly so besotted

<P>that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness,

<P>the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission. Her

<P>relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a

<P>marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have

<P>no respect for myself when I think of that act!- an agony of inward

<P>contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even

<P>know her. I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature:

<P>I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor

<P>refinement in her mind or manners- and, I married her:- gross,

<P>grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might

<P>have- But let me remember to whom I am speaking.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was
dead. The

<P>honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up
in

<P>a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too- a complete dumb

<P>idiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,

<P>whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of

<P>affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes

<P>in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore

<P>me), will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my

<P>brother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty

<P>thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery
of

<P>concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my

<P>wife, even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes

<P>obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and

<P>singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to

<P>anything larger- when I found that I could not pass a single

<P>evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that

<P>kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because

<P>whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once

<P>coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile- when I perceived that I

<P>should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant

<P>would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable

<P>temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting

<P>orders- even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I

<P>curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust
in

<P>secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details:
some

<P>strong words shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman

<P>upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her

<P>character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices

<P>sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check

<P>them, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and

<P>what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those

<P>propensities entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an

<P>infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading

<P>agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate

<P>and unchaste.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of
the four

<P>years my father died too. I was rich enough now- yet poor to hideous

<P>indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was

<P>associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of

<P>me. And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the

<P>doctors now discovered that my wife was mad- her excesses had

<P>prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don't like my

<P>narrative; you look almost sick- shall I defer the rest to another

<P>day?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, finish it now; I pity you- I do earnestly pity
you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting
sort of

<P>tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of

<P>those who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous,

<P>selfish hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes,

<P>crossed with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them. But

<P>that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole

<P>face is full at this moment- with which your eyes are now almost

<P>overflowing- with which your heart is heaving- with which your hand
is

<P>trembling in mine. Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of

<P>love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. I

<P>accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent- my arms wait to

<P>receive her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she
was mad?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of
self-respect

<P>was all that intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the

<P>world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved
to

<P>be clean in my own sight- and to the last I repudiated the

<P>contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection

<P>with her mental defects. Still, society associated my name and

<P>person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily: something of

<P>her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I

<P>remembered I had once been her husband- that recollection was then,

<P>and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while

<P>she lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife;

<P>and, though five years my senior (her family and her father had lied

<P>to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live as

<P>long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind. Thus,

<P>at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One night I had been awakened by her yells- (since the
medical men

<P>had pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)- it was a

<P>fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently

<P>precede the hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in

<P>bed, I got up and opened the window. The air was like

<P>sulphur-steams- I could find no refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes

<P>came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I

<P>could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake- black

<P>clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves,

<P>broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball- she threw her last bloody

<P>glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest. I was

<P>physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were

<P>filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she

<P>momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with

<P>such language!- no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary

<P>than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word- the thin

<P>partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction

<P>to her wolfish cries.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"This life," said I at last, "is hell: this is the air-
those

<P>are the sounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself

<P>from it if I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me

<P>with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic's

<P>burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse

<P>than this present one- let me break away, and go home to God!"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk
which

<P>contained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only

<P>entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the

<P>crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the

<P>wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed
through

<P>the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and

<P>the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I

<P>walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst

<P>its drenched pomegranates and pineapples, and while the refulgent dawn

<P>of the tropics kindled round me- I reasoned thus, Jane- and now

<P>listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and

<P>showed me the right path to follow.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the
refreshed

<P>leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart,

<P>dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled

<P>with living blood- my being longed for renewal- my soul thirsted for
a

<P>pure draught. I saw hope revive- and felt regeneration possible.

<P>From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea-

<P>bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened

<P>thus:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Go," said Hope, "and live again in Europe: there it is
not

<P>known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is

<P>bound to you. You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her

<P>with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel

<P>yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like.

<P>That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied your

<P>name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your

<P>wife, nor are you her husband. See that she is cared for as her

<P>condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require

<P>of you. Let her identity, her connection with yourself, be buried in

<P>oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being. Place her

<P>in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave

<P>her."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother
had

<P>not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very

<P>first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union- having already

<P>begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the

<P>family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening

<P>to me- I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the

<P>infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such
as

<P>to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring

<P>to publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as

<P>myself.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had
with such

<P>a monster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to

<P>Thornfield, and saw her safely lodged in that third storey room, of

<P>whose secret inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild

<P>beast's den- a goblin's cell. I had some trouble in finding an

<P>attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity

<P>dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray
my

<P>secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days- sometimes weeks-

<P>which she filled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from

<P>the Grimsby Retreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed

<P>Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and worried), are the only

<P>two I have ever admitted to my confidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed

<P>have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise

<P>knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a good

<P>keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it

<P>appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing

<P>profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and

<P>baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never

<P>failed to take advantage of her guardian's temporary lapses; once to

<P>secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to

<P>possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the

<P>night-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the

<P>attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly

<P>visit to you. I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she

<P>then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought

<P>back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might

<P>have happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of the thing

<P>which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet

<P>visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what, sir,' I asked, while he paused, 'did you do
when you had

<P>settled her here? Where did you go?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.

<P>Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the

<P>March-spirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its

<P>lands. My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent

<P>woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at

<P>Thornfield-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you could not marry, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.
It

<P>was not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I

<P>meant to tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it

<P>appeared to me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free

<P>to love and be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found

<P>willing and able to understand my case and accept me, in spite of

<P>the curse with which I was burdened.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.
You open

<P>your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless

<P>movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you,

<P>and you wanted to read the tablet of one's heart. But before I go

<P>on, tell me what you mean by your "Well, sir?" It is a small phrase

<P>very frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on

<P>through interminable talk: I don't very well know why.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I mean,- What next? How did you proceed? What came of
such an

<P>event?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked
her to

<P>marry you; and what she said.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether
I

<P>asked her to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in

<P>the book of Fate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in

<P>one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in

<P>Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with

<P>plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own

<P>society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my ideal of a

<P>woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and

<P>German grafinnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting

<P>moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form,

<P>which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently

<P>undeceived. You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either

<P>of mind or person. I longed only for what suited me- for the antipodes

<P>of the Creole: and I longed vainly. Amongst them all I found not one

<P>whom, had I been ever so free, I- warned as I was of the risks, the

<P>horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions- would have asked to

<P>marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation-

<P>never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian

<P>Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me

<P>much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed

<P>to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship
of

<P>mistresses. The first I chose was Celine Varens- another of those

<P>steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already

<P>know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two

<P>successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered

<P>singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?

<P>Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.

<P>Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible:

<P>not one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to

<P>set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.

<P>But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable

<P>opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled

<P>rake: don't you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed,
sir.

<P>Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first

<P>with one mistress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter
of

<P>course.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling
fashion

<P>of existence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress

<P>is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature,

<P>and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with

<P>inferiors is degrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I

<P>passed with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the
certain

<P>inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching

<P>that had ever been instilled into me, as- under any pretext- with

<P>any justification- through any temptation- to become the successor

<P>of these poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same

<P>feeling which now in his mind desecrated their memory. I did not

<P>give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it. I

<P>impressed it on my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as

<P>aid in the time of trial.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Jane, why don't you say "Well, sir?" I have not done.
You are

<P>looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to

<P>the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses- in a harsh, bitter

<P>frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life-

<P>corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and

<P>especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion

<P>of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream),

<P>recalled by business, I came back to England.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield

<P>Hall. Abhorred spot! I expected no peace- no pleasure there. On a

<P>stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I

<P>passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it:
I

<P>had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning

<P>that the arbitress of my life- my genius for good or evil- waited

<P>there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion

<P>of Mesrour's accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.

<P>Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped

<P>to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly;

<P>but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange

<P>perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority. I must
be

<P>aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something
new- a fresh

<P>sap and sense- stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this

<P>elf must return to me- that it belonged to my house down below- or I

<P>could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it

<P>vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come

<P>home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I

<P>thought of you or watched for you. The next day I observed you- myself

<P>unseen- for half an hour, while you played with Adele in the

<P>gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out

<P>of doors. I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and

<P>watch. Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied

<P>your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my

<P>little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at

<P>last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook

<P>yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a

<P>casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to

<P>the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think

<P>those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable

<P>illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your

<P>aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your

<P>look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit

<P>follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal

<P>heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the

<P>hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself,

<P>Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and

<P>seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to say- "My

<P>fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are

<P>absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my

<P>brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough

<P>tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter."

<P>You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the

<P>weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think

<P>it was. I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon
you to my

<P>presence. An unusual- to me- a perfectly new character I suspected was

<P>yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered

<P>the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were

<P>quaintly dressed- much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I

<P>found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were

<P>restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether

<P>that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and
a

<P>good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by

<P>some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a

<P>daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor's face: there was

<P>penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close

<P>questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed

<P>to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy

<P>between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was

<P>astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised

<P>your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear,

<P>annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now

<P>and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot

<P>describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I

<P>liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time,
I

<P>treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an

<P>intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of

<P>making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while

<P>troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely

<P>its bloom would fade- the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I

<P>did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the

<P>radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover,

<P>I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you- but you

<P>did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and

<P>easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as

<P>little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your

<P>habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not

<P>despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had

<P>little hope, and no actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of

<P>me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in
your

<P>glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had
a

<P>social heart; it was the silent schoolroom- it was the tedium of

<P>your life- that made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of

<P>being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became

<P>soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by

<P>your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting

<P>with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your

<P>manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble- a hovering doubt: you

<P>did not know what my caprice might be- whether I was going to play the

<P>master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too

<P>fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched
my

<P>hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young,

<P>wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and

<P>there to my heart.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't talk any more of those days, sir,' I interrupted,

<P>furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was

<P>torture to me; for I knew what I must do- and do soon- and these

<P>reminiscences, and these revelations of his feelings, only made my

<P>work more difficult.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Jane,' he returned: 'what necessity is there to dwell
on the

<P>Past, when the Present is so much surer- the Future so much brighter?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see now how the case stands- do you not?' he continued.
'After

<P>a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in

<P>dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly

<P>love- I have found you. You are my sympathy- my better self- my good

<P>angel. I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good,

<P>gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my

<P>heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life,

<P>wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame,

<P>fuses you and me in one.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to
marry you.

<P>To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now

<P>that I had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you;

<P>but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared

<P>early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before

<P>hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to

<P>your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now- opened to you

<P>plainly my life of agony- described to you my hunger and thirst

<P>after a higher and worthier existence- shown to you, not my resolution

<P>(that word is weak), but my resistless bent to love faithfully and

<P>well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should

<P>have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.

<P>Jane- give it me now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pause.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why are you silent, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped
my

<P>vitals. Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a

<P>human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was

<P>loved; and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must

<P>renounce love and idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable

<P>duty- 'Depart!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise-
"I

<P>will be yours, Mr. Rochester."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another long silence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane!' recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me
down with

<P>grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror- for this still

<P>voice was the pant of a lion rising- 'Jane, do you mean to go one

<P>way in the world, and to let me go another?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane' (bending towards and embracing me), 'do you mean
it now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And now?' softly kissing my forehead and cheek.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do,' extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This- this is wicked. It would
not be

<P>wicked to love me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would to obey you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A wild look raised his brows- crossed his features: he
rose; but he

<P>forbore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I

<P>shook, I feared- but I resolved.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life
when you

<P>are gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left?

<P>For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer

<P>me to some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where

<P>turn for a companion and for some hope?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven.
Hope

<P>to meet again there.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you will not yield?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?'
His

<P>voice rose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling
me back on

<P>lust for a passion- vice for an occupation?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than
I grasp at

<P>it for myself. We were born to strive and endure- you as well as I:
do

<P>so. You will forget me before I forget you.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.
I

<P>declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change

<P>soon. And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in

<P>your ideas, is proved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a

<P>fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man

<P>being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives nor

<P>acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and
reason

<P>turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting

<P>him. They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured

<P>wildly. 'Oh, comply!' it said. 'Think of his misery; think of his

<P>danger- look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong

<P>nature; consider the recklessness following on despair- soothe him;

<P>save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in

<P>the world cares for you? or who will be injured by what you do?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still indomitable was the reply- 'I care for myself. The
more

<P>solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I

<P>will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by

<P>man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and

<P>not mad- as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when

<P>there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body

<P>and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they;

<P>inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break

<P>them, what would be their worth? They have a worth- so I have always

<P>believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane-

<P>quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating

<P>faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone

<P>determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant

<P>my foot.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had
done so.

<P>His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,

<P>whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and

<P>grasped my waist. He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance:

<P>physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the

<P>draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul,

<P>and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately,

<P>has an interpreter- often an unconscious, but still a truthful

<P>interpreter- in the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his

<P>fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and

<P>my overtaxed strength almost exhausted.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never,' said he, as he ground his teeth, 'never was anything
at

<P>once so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!'

<P>(And he shook me with the force of his hold.) 'I could bend her with

<P>my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore,

<P>if I crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free

<P>thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage- with a

<P>stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it- the

<P>savage, beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison,
my

<P>outrage will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the

<P>house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call

<P>myself possessor of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit-

<P>with will and energy, and virtue and purity- that I want: not alone

<P>your brittle frame. Of yourself you could come with soft flight and

<P>nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you

<P>will elude the grasp like an essence- you will vanish ere I inhale

<P>your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only
looked at

<P>me. The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only

<P>an idiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled

<P>his fury; I must elude his sorrow: retired to the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are going, Jane?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am going, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are leaving me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?
My

<P>deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was
to

<P>reiterate firmly, 'I am going.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Withdraw, then,- I consent; but remember, you leave me
here in

<P>anguish. Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and,

<P>Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings- think of me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.
'Oh,

<P>Jane! my hope- my love- my life!' broke in anguish from his lips. Then

<P>came a deep, strong sob.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back-
walked

<P>back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned

<P>his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his

<P>hair with my hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God bless you, my dear master!' I said. 'God keep you
from harm

<P>and wrong- direct you, solace you- reward you well for your past

<P>kindness to me.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,' he
answered;

<P>'without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love:

<P>yes- nobly, generously.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire
from his

<P>eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace,

<P>and at once quitted the room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell!' was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair
added,

<P>'Farewell for ever!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell
on me as

<P>soon as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the

<P>scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that

<P>the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The

<P>light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this

<P>vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause

<P>in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look:

<P>the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the

<P>moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come-

<P>watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom

<P>were to be written on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet

<P>burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved

<P>them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the

<P>azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on

<P>me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so

<P>near, it whispered in my heart-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My daughter, flee temptation.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mother, I will.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I answered after I had waked from the trancelike dream.
It was

<P>yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.

<P>'It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,'

<P>thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my

<P>shoes. I knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a

<P>ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl

<P>necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I

<P>left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride's who had

<P>melted in air. The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse,

<P>containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket:

<P>I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my

<P>slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!' I whispered, as I glided
past her

<P>door. 'Farewell, my darling Adele! I said, as I glanced towards the

<P>nursery. No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I

<P>had to deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a
pause;

<P>but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my

<P>foot was forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was

<P>walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed

<P>while I listened. There was a heaven- a temporary heaven- in this room

<P>for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through
life till

<P>death,' and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of

<P>this.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting
with

<P>impatience for day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be

<P>gone. He would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself

<P>forsaken; his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow

<P>desperate. I thought of this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I

<P>caught it back, and glided on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to
do, and

<P>I did it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the

<P>kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the

<P>key and the lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I

<P>should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late,

<P>must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened the

<P>door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.

<P>The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them

<P>was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now

<P>I was out of Thornfield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched
in the

<P>contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but

<P>often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.

<P>No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast

<P>back; not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either

<P>to the past or to the future. The first was a page so heavenly

<P>sweet- so deadly sad- that to read one line of it would dissolve my

<P>courage and break down my energy. The last was an awful blank:

<P>something like the world when the deluge was gone by.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.
I

<P>believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had

<P>put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked

<P>neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who
is

<P>taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not

<P>of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and

<P>axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping
at

<P>the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering- and oh!

<P>with agony I thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought
of

<P>him now- in his room- watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon

<P>come to say I would stay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I

<P>panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the

<P>bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I was sure, was

<P>undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter- his pride; his

<P>redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of his

<P>self-abandonment- far worse than my abandonment- how it goaded me!

<P>It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to

<P>extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.

<P>Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their

<P>mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of my pain

<P>of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I had

<P>no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had

<P>injured- wounded- left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes.

<P>Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on.

<P>As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one

<P>and stifled the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my

<P>solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness,

<P>beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I

<P>lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I

<P>had some fear- or hope- that here I should die: but I was soon up;

<P>crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my

<P>feet- as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under
the hedge;

<P>and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up

<P>and lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver

<P>named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had

<P>no connections. I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said

<P>thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to

<P>make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the

<P>vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May
your eyes

<P>never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from

<P>mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so

<P>agonised as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me,

<P>dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.
