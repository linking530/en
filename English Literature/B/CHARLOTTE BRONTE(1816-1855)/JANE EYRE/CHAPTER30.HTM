<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better
I liked

<P>them. In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could

<P>sit up all day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and

<P>Mary in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they

<P>wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a

<P>reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me

<P>for the first time- the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality

<P>of tastes, sentiments, and principles.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed,

<P>delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their

<P>sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure,

<P>with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its

<P>avenue of aged firs- all grown aslant under the stress of mountain

<P>winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly- and where no flowers but

<P>of the hardiest species would bloom- found a charm both potent and

<P>permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around their

<P>dwelling- to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading

<P>from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first,

<P>and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that

<P>ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock

<P>of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:- they

<P>clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment.
I

<P>could comprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth.
I

<P>saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its

<P>loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep- on the

<P>wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by

<P>heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow

<P>granite crag. These details were just to me what they were to them-
so

<P>many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the soft

<P>breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and

<P>sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in

<P>these regions, the same attraction as for them- wound round my

<P>faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished

<P>and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the

<P>path of knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books

<P>they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in

<P>the evening what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought;

<P>opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was
Diana.

<P>Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.

<P>In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty

<P>of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.

<P>I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush
of

<P>vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's

<P>feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and

<P>Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but

<P>touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her:

<P>I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar

<P>pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual

<P>affection- of the strongest kind- was the result. They discovered I

<P>could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my

<P>service. My skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised

<P>and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together:

<P>then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous

<P>pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed

<P>like hours, and weeks like days.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Mr. St. John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally

<P>and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One

<P>reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was

<P>comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time

<P>appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered

<P>population of his parish.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions:

<P>rain or fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over,

<P>take his hat, and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out

<P>on his mission of love or duty- I scarcely know in which light he

<P>regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his

<P>sisters would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile,

<P>more solemn than cheerful-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn
me

<P>aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be

<P>for the future I propose to myself?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a
sigh, and

<P>some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier
to

<P>friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and

<P>even of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours,

<P>blameless in his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy

<P>that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the

<P>reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often,

<P>of an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before

<P>him, he would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and

<P>deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it

<P>was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and

<P>changeful dilation of his eye.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury
of

<P>delight it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my

<P>hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an

<P>inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home;

<P>but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in

<P>which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam

<P>the moors for the sake of their soothing silence- never seek out or

<P>dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had
an

<P>opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre

<P>when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could

<P>describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render

<P>faithfully the effect it produced on me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It began calm- and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch
of voice

<P>went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly

<P>restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted

<P>the nervous language. This grew to force- compressed, condensed,

<P>controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the

<P>power of the preacher: neither were softened. Throughout there was a

<P>strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern

<P>allusions to Calvinistic doctrines- election, predestination,

<P>reprobation- were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded

<P>like a sentence pronounced for doom. When he had done, instead of

<P>feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his discourse, I

<P>experienced an expressible sadness; for it seemed to me- I know not

<P>whether equally so to others- that the eloquence to which I had been

<P>listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of

<P>disappointment- where moved troubling impulses of insatiate

<P>yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers-

<P>pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was- had not yet found that

<P>peace of God which passeth all understanding; he had no more found it,

<P>I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my

<P>broken idol and lost elysium- regrets to which I have latterly avoided

<P>referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to
leave Moor

<P>House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited

<P>them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,

<P>where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty

<P>members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who

<P>neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and

<P>appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated

<P>the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St.

<P>John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he had promised

<P>to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation

<P>of some kind. One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes

<P>in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess- which his

<P>table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study- and I was going

<P>to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my

<P>inquiry- for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of

<P>reserve glassing over such natures as his- when he saved me the

<P>trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up as I drew near- 'You have a question to ask
of me?' he

<P>said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service
I can

<P>offer myself to undertake?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I found or devised something for you three weeks ago;
but as you

<P>seemed both useful and happy here- as my sisters had evidently

<P>become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure-
I

<P>deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their

<P>approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And they will go in three days now?' I said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage
at

<P>Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the
subject

<P>first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of

<P>reflection: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I

<P>was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of

<P>close and anxious interest to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I
hope this

<P>delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on
me to

<P>give, and you to accept.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.
I grew

<P>impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting

<P>glance fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as

<P>effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need be in no hurry to hear,' he said: 'let me frankly
tell

<P>you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I

<P>explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I

<P>helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am

<P>poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the

<P>patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of

<P>scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees

<P>and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but
of

<P>the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant's crust

<P>among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his

<P>native country- not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and

<P>is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after

<P>the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid

<P>on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose

<P>humblest members he is one, shall give the word, "Rise, follow Me!"'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons,
with a

<P>quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance

<P>of glance. He resumed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you
but a

<P>service of poverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading- for

<P>I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your

<P>tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst

<P>the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better

<P>our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the

<P>Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him- the scantier

<P>the meed his toil brings- the higher the honour. His, under such

<P>circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers

<P>of the Gospel were the Apostles- their captain was Jesus, the

<P>Redeemer, Himself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?' I said, as he again paused- 'proceed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed
leisurely to

<P>read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a

<P>page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially

<P>expressed in his succeeding observations.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you will accept the post I offer you,' said
he, 'and

<P>hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could

<P>permanently keep the narrow and narrowing- the tranquil, hidden office

<P>of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as

<P>detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do explain,' I urged, when he halted once more.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,-
how trivial-

<P>how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is

<P>dead, and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably
in

<P>the course of a twelvemonth; but while I do stay, I will exert

<P>myself to the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it

<P>two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded

<P>from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now
to

<P>open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the

<P>purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress's

<P>house. Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already

<P>furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady,

<P>Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish-

<P>Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the

<P>valley. The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan

<P>from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in

<P>such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her

<P>occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in

<P>person. Will you be this mistress?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to
expect an

<P>indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not

<P>knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could

<P>not tell in what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was

<P>humble- but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it

<P>was plodding- but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich

<P>house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers

<P>entered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble- not unworthy- not

<P>mentally degrading. I made my decision.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept
it with all

<P>my heart.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you comprehend me?' he said. 'It is a village school:
your

<P>scholars will be only poor girls- cottagers' children- at the best,

<P>farmers' daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering,

<P>will be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your

<P>accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your mind-

<P>sentiments- tastes?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know what you undertake, then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one
well

<P>pleased and deeply gratified.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when will you commence the exercise of your function?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school,
if you like,

<P>next week.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well: so be it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he
again

<P>looked at me. He shook his head.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why? What is your reason for saying so?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which

<P>promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not ambitious.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He started at the word 'ambitious.' He repeated, 'No. What
made you

<P>think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find

<P>it out?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was speaking of myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, if you are not ambitious, you are-' He paused.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would
have

<P>misunderstood the word, and been displeased. I mean, that human

<P>affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am

<P>sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude,

<P>and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void
of

<P>stimulus: any more than I can be content,' he added, with emphasis,

<P>'to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains- my nature,

<P>that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed,

<P>paralysed- made useless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I,

<P>who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation

<P>even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service- I, His

<P>ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness. Well,

<P>propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more
of him

<P>than in the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the
day

<P>approached for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried

<P>to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was

<P>one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated

<P>that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet

<P>known. It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a

<P>parting for years: it might be a parting for life.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,' she
said:

<P>'natural affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks

<P>quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him

<P>gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst
of

<P>it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his

<P>severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.
It

<P>is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!' And the tears

<P>gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We are now without father: we shall soon be without home
and

<P>brother,' she murmured.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed
decreed

<P>by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that 'misfortunes

<P>never come singly,' and to add to their distresses the vexing one of

<P>the slip between the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window

<P>reading a letter. He entered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Our uncle John is dead,' said he.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled;
the

<P>tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead?' repeated Diana.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. 'And
what

<P>then?' she demanded, in a low voice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What then, Die?' he replied, maintaining a marble immobility
of

<P>feature. 'What then? Why- nothing. Read.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it,
and handed

<P>it to Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her

<P>brother. All three looked at each other, and all three smiled- a

<P>dreary, pensive smile enough.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Amen! We can yet live,' said Diana at last.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,'

<P>remarked Mary.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture
of what

<P>might have been; said Mr. Rivers, 'and contrasts it somewhat too

<P>vividly with what is.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again
went out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,' she said,
'and

<P>think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so

<P>near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known

<P>him. He was my mother's brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago.

<P>It was by his advice that my father risked most of his property in the

<P>speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them:

<P>they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged

<P>afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a

<P>fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no

<P>near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely

<P>related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would

<P>atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter

<P>informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,

<P>with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St.

<P>John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning

<P>rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a

<P>momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news.

<P>Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds

<P>each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the

<P>good it would have enabled him to do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no
further

<P>reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day

<P>I left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted

<P>the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.
