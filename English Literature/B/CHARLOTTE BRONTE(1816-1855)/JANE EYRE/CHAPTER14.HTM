<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.
In the

<P>mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the

<P>afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and

<P>sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough

<P>to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to

<P>return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at

<P>night.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to
his

<P>presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an

<P>occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery,

<P>when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just

<P>acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and

<P>sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His changes

<P>of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with

<P>their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite

<P>disconnected with me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for
my

<P>portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen

<P>went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs.

<P>Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr.

<P>Rochester did not accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang

<P>the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs. I

<P>brushed Adele's hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that

<P>I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to

<P>retouch- all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to

<P>admit of disarrangement- we descended, Adele wondering whether the

<P>petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its

<P>arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was gratified: there it

<P>stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the

<P>dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ma boite! ma boite!' exclaimed she, running towards it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, there is your "boite" at last: take it into a corner,
you

<P>genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,'

<P>said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester,

<P>proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.

<P>'And mind,' he continued, 'don't bother me with any details of the

<P>anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails:

<P>let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille,

<P>enfant; comprends-tu?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already

<P>retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord

<P>which secured the lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted

<P>certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh ciel! Que c'est beau!' and then remained absorbed in
ecstatic

<P>contemplation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Miss Eyre there?' now demanded the master, half rising
from his

<P>seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.' He drew a chair
near

<P>his own. 'I am not fond of the prattle of children,' he continued;

<P>'for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations

<P>connected with their lisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a

<P>whole evening tete-a-tete with a brat. Don't draw that chair farther

<P>off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it- if you please,

<P>that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor

<P>do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By the bye, I

<P>must have mine in mind; it won't do to neglect her; she is a

<P>Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax,
who soon

<P>arrived, knitting-basket in hand.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.
I

<P>have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is

<P>bursting with repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress

<P>and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you

<P>ever performed.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned
her to

<P>her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the

<P>ivory, the waxen contents of her 'boite'; pouring out, meantime,

<P>explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress

<P>of.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now I have performed the part of a good host,' pursued
Mr.

<P>Rochester, 'put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I

<P>ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw

<P>your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back;
I

<P>cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable

<P>chair, which I have no mind to do.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained

<P>somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of

<P>giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre,
which

<P>had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of

<P>light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains

<P>hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch;

<P>everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adele (she dared not

<P>speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain

<P>against the panes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked

<P>different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern- much

<P>less gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled,

<P>whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.

<P>He was, in short, in his after dinner mood; more expanded and

<P>genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid

<P>temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his

<P>massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the

<P>light of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark

<P>eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too- not

<P>without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was

<P>not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had
been looking

<P>the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my

<P>gaze fastened on his physiognomy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You examine me, Miss Eyre,' said he: 'do you think me
handsome?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question
by

<P>something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow

<P>slipped from my tongue before I was aware- 'No, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,'
said he:

<P>'you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and

<P>simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally

<P>bent on the carpet (except, by the bye, when they are directed

<P>piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks

<P>you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply,

<P>you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least

<P>brusque. What do you mean by it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have
replied

<P>that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about

<P>appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little

<P>consequence, or something of that sort.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little

<P>consequence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the

<P>previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you

<P>stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what fault do you find

<P>with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features

<P>like any other man?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended
no

<P>pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.
Criticise

<P>me: does my forehead not please you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally
over

<P>his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but

<P>an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have

<P>risen.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, ma'am, am I a fool?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if
I

<P>inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended

<P>to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the

<P>society of children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady,

<P>I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience'; and he

<P>pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty,

<P>and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving,

<P>indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: 'and, besides,

<P>I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as

<P>you, I was a feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged,

<P>unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she

<P>has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am

<P>hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a

<P>chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the

<P>lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hope of what, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to
flesh?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Decidedly he has had too much wine,' I thought; and I
did not know

<P>what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether
he

<P>was capable of being re-transformed?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you
are not

<P>pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you;

<P>besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of

<P>yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted

<P>flowers of the rug; so puzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be

<P>gregarious and communicative tonight.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood,
leaning

<P>his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen

<P>plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,

<P>disproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people

<P>would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much

<P>unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a

<P>look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so

<P>haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or

<P>adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness,

<P>that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared the indifference,

<P>and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative tonight,'
he

<P>repeated, 'and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier

<P>were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for

<P>none of these can talk. Adele is a degree better, but still far

<P>below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me

<P>if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.

<P>I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours

<P>from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss

<P>what importunes, and recall what pleases. It would please me now to

<P>draw you out- to learn more of you- therefore speak.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent
or

<P>submissive smile either.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Speak,' he urged.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What about, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject
and the

<P>manner of treating it entirely to yourself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly I sat and said nothing: 'If he expects me to
talk for

<P>the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has

<P>addressed himself to the wrong person,' I thought.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are dumb, Miss Eyre.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me,
and with

<P>a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Stubborn?' he said, 'and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent.
I put my

<P>request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your

<P>pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an

<P>inferior: that is' (correcting himself), 'I claim only such

<P>superiority as must result from twenty years' difference in age and

<P>a century's advance in experience. This is legitimate, et j'y tiens,

<P>as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and

<P>this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a

<P>little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling

<P>on one point- cankering as a rusty nail.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I
did not

<P>feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir- quite willing;
but I

<P>cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest

<P>you? Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I
have a right

<P>to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on

<P>the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your

<P>father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with

<P>many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you

<P>have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do as you please, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating,
because a

<P>very evasive one. Reply clearly.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely
because

<P>you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world

<P>than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have

<P>made of your time and experience.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won't allow that, seeing
that it

<P>would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say

<P>a bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the

<P>question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and

<P>then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar-
he seems

<P>to forget that he pays me L30 per annum for receiving his orders.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The smile is very well,' said he, catching instantly the
passing

<P>expression; 'but speak too.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble

<P>themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were

<P>piqued and hurt by their orders.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate,
are you?

<P>Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary

<P>ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you
did

<P>forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependant is comfortable

<P>in his dependency, I agree heartily.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional

<P>forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from

<P>insolence?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for

<P>insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit

<P>to, even for a salary.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything
for a

<P>salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities

<P>of which you are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands

<P>with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for

<P>the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech;

<P>the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a

<P>manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid,

<P>coarse-minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual rewards

<P>of candour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses

<P>would have answered me as you have just done. But I don't mean to

<P>flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority,

<P>it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. And then, after all, I go

<P>too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no

<P>better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to

<P>counterbalance your few good points.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so may you,' I thought. My eye met his as the idea
crossed

<P>my mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import

<P>had been spoken as well as imagined-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, yes, you are right,' said he; 'I have plenty of faults
of

<P>my own: I know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.

<P>God wot I need not be too severe about others; I have a past

<P>existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within

<P>my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my

<P>neighbours to myself. I started, or rather (for like other defaulters,

<P>I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances)

<P>was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have

<P>never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very

<P>different; I might have been as good as you- wiser- almost as

<P>stainless. I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience,

<P>your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a memory without blot or

<P>contamination must be an exquisite treasure- an inexhaustible source

<P>of pure refreshment: is it not?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water
had

<P>turned it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen- quite your

<P>equal. Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one

<P>of the better kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don't

<P>see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye

<P>(beware, by the bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at

<P>interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,- I am not a

<P>villain: you are not to suppose that- not to attribute to me any

<P>such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to

<P>circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace

<P>sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the

<P>rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you wonder that I avow

<P>this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life you will

<P>often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your

<P>acquaintances' secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I

<P>have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to

<P>listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that

<P>you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with

<P>a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging

<P>because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you know?- how can you guess all this, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as
if I

<P>were writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been

<P>superior to circumstances; so I should- so I should; but you see I was

<P>not. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I

<P>turned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious

<P>simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot

<P>flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that

<P>he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood firm- God knows I do!

<P>Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the

<P>poison of life.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I
could

<P>reform- I have strength yet for that- if- but where is the use of

<P>thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since

<P>happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out

<P>of life: and I will get it, cost what it may.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you will degenerate still more, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh
pleasure?

<P>And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee

<P>gathers on the moor.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It will sting- it will taste bitter, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you know?- you never tried it. How very serious-
how very

<P>solemn you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo

<P>head' (taking one from the mantelpiece). 'You have no right to

<P>preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life,

<P>and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error
brought

<P>remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion
that

<P>flittered across my brain was an error. I believe it was an

<P>inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very

<P>soothing- I know that. Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure

<P>you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light. I

<P>think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend
to

<P>distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger

<P>from the eternal throne- between a guide and a seducer?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled
when you

<P>said the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work

<P>you more misery if you listen to it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all- it bears the most gracious message in the
world: for

<P>the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself

<P>uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wanderer!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any
eye but

<P>his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his

<P>chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' he continued, again addressing me, 'I have received
the

<P>pilgrim- a disguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done

<P>me good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I
cannot

<P>keep up the conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one

<P>thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be,

<P>and that you regretted your own imperfection;- one thing I can

<P>comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a

<P>perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in

<P>time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and

<P>that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your

<P>thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new

<P>and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with

<P>pleasure.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this
moment, I am

<P>paving hell with energy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable
as

<P>flint. Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than

<P>they have been.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And better?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And better- so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.
You

<P>seem to doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what
my

<P>motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of

<P>the Medes and Persians, that both are right.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to
legalise

<P>them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a
new statute:

<P>unheard-of combinations or circumstances demand unheard-of rules.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see
at once

<P>that it is liable to abuse.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household
gods not

<P>to abuse it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are human and fallible.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am: so are you- what then?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with
which

<P>the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What power?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,-

<P>"Let it be right."'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Let it be right"- the very words: you have pronounced
them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May it be right then,' I said, as I rose, deeming it useless
to

<P>continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,

<P>sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my

<P>penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the

<P>uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a

<P>conviction of ignorance.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you going?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered,
I

<P>am certainly not afraid.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are afraid- your self-love dreads a blunder.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In that sense I do feel apprehensive- I have no wish to
talk

<P>nonsense.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner,
I should

<P>mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don't trouble

<P>yourself to answer- I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very

<P>merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I
am

<P>naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;

<P>controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your

<P>limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother- or father,

<P>or master, or what you will- to smile too gaily, speak too freely,

<P>or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be

<P>natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with

<P>you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and

<P>variety than they dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a

<P>curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid,

<P>restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar

<P>cloud-high. You are still bent on going?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It has struck nine, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind,- wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to
bed yet.

<P>My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the

<P>room, favours observation. While talking to you, I have also

<P>occasionally watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a

<P>curious study,- reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you

<P>some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a

<P>little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it;

<P>coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the

<P>marrow of her bones. "Il faut que je l'essaie!" cried she, "et a

<P>l'instant meme!" and she rushed out of the room. She is now with

<P>Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will

<P>re-enter; and I know what I shall see,- a miniature of Celine

<P>Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of-. But

<P>never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive
a

<P>shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be

<P>realised.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across
the hall.

<P>She entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of

<P>rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it

<P>could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn;
a

<P>wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk

<P>stockings and small white satin sandals.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Est-ce que ma robe va bien?' cried she, bounding forwards;
'et mes

<P>souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room;
till,

<P>having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him

<P>on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;
then rising,

<P>she added, 'C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas,

<P>monsieur?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pre-cise-ly!' was the answer; 'and, "comme cella," she
charmed

<P>my English gold out of my British breeches' pocket. I have been green,

<P>too, Miss Eyre- ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you

<P>now than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has

<P>left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I

<P>would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang;

<P>having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could

<P>manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it

<P>looks so artificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the

<P>Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small,

<P>by one good work. I'll explain all this some day. Good-night.'
