<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for
an hour or

<P>two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe,

<P>in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief

<P>absence. Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my

<P>door: I feared he would knock- no, but a slip of paper was passed

<P>under the door. I took it up. It bore these words-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but
a little

<P>longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the

<P>angel's crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this

<P>day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into

<P>temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see,

<P>is weak. I shall pray for you hourly.- Yours, ST. JOHN.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My spirit,' I answered mentally, 'is willing to do what
is

<P>right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will

<P>of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate,

<P>it shall be strong enough to search- inquire- to grope an outlet

<P>from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast
and

<P>chilly: rain beat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open,

<P>and St. John pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him

<P>traverse the garden. He took the way over the misty moors in the

<P>direction of Whitcross- there he would meet the coach.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track,
cousin,'

<P>thought I: 'I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some

<P>to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the
interval in

<P>walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had

<P>given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation

<P>I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable

<P>strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned

<P>whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in me- not in the

<P>external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression- a

<P>delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an

<P>inspiration. The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the

<P>earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison;

<P>it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed its bands- it

<P>had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling,

<P>listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear,

<P>and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared

<P>nor shook but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it

<P>had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ere many days,' I said, as I terminated my musings, 'I
will know

<P>something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters

<P>have proved of no avail- personal inquiry shall replace them.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going
a

<P>journey, and should be absent at least four days.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Alone, Jane?' they asked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom
I had for

<P>some time been uneasy.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought,
that they

<P>had believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I

<P>had often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they

<P>abstained from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was

<P>well enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied,

<P>that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to

<P>alleviate.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was
troubled

<P>with no inquiries- no surmises. Having once explained to them that I

<P>could not now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely

<P>acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued them, according to me

<P>the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have

<P>accorded them.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I left Moor House at three o'clock P.M., and soon after
four I

<P>stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival

<P>of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the

<P>silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it

<P>approach from a great distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year

<P>ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot- how

<P>desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I

<P>entered- not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price
of

<P>its accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like

<P>the messenger-pigeon flying home.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out
from

<P>Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday

<P>morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn,

<P>situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields

<P>and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue

<P>compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye

<P>like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character

<P>of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How far is Thornfield Hall from here?' I asked of the
ostler.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My journey is closed,' I thought to myself. I got out
of the

<P>coach, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I

<P>called for it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going:

<P>the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt

<P>letters, 'The Rochester Arms.' My heart leapt up: I was already on

<P>my master's very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:-

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel,
for aught

<P>you know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you

<P>hasten, who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have

<P>nothing to do with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his

<P>presence. You have lost your labour- you had better go no farther,'

<P>urged the monitor. 'Ask information of the people at the inn; they can

<P>give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to

<P>that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force
self to

<P>act on it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To

<P>prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the

<P>Hall under the ray of her star. There was the stile before me- the

<P>very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted

<P>with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I

<P>fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to

<P>take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran

<P>sometimes? How I looked forward to catch the first view of the

<P>well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew,

<P>and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud
cawing

<P>broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I

<P>hastened. Another field crossed- a lane threaded- and there were the

<P>courtyard walls- the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still

<P>hid. 'My first view of it shall be in front,' I determined, 'where its

<P>bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can

<P>single out my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it-

<P>he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the

<P>pavement in front. Could I but see him!- but a moment? Surely, in that

<P>case, I should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell- I am not

<P>certain. And if I did- what then? God bless him! What then? Who

<P>would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?

<P>I rave: perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the

<P>Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard- turned
its

<P>angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between

<P>two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I

<P>could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I

<P>advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom

<P>window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front- all

<P>from this sheltered station were at my command.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took
this

<P>survey. I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was

<P>very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold

<P>and reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from

<P>my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full
in

<P>front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.

<P>'What affectation of diffidence was this at first?' they might have

<P>demanded; 'what stupid regardlessness now?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear an illustration, reader.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes
to

<P>catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals

<P>softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses- fancying

<P>she has stirred: he withdraws; not for worlds would he be seen. All
is

<P>still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on

<P>her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the

<P>vision of beauty- warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried

<P>was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he

<P>suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a

<P>moment since, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and

<P>drops his burden, and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries,

<P>and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can

<P>utter- by any movement he can make. He thought his love slept sweetly:

<P>he finds she is stone dead.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw
a

<P>blackened ruin.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!- to peep up
at chamber

<P>lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for

<P>doors opening- to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!

<P>The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned

<P>void. The front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a

<P>shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with

<P>paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys- all had

<P>crashed in.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude
of a

<P>lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had

<P>never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a

<P>church aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the

<P>Hall had fallen- by conflagration: but how kindled? What story

<P>belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and

<P>woodwork had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as

<P>property? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to

<P>answer it- not even dumb sign, mute token.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In wandering round the shattered walls and through the
devastated

<P>interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late

<P>occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void

<P>arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst

<P>the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation:

<P>grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen

<P>rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?

<P>In what land? Under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to

<P>the grey church tower near the gates, and I asked, 'Is he with Damer

<P>de Rochester, sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find
it nowhere

<P>but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself

<P>brought my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the

<P>door and sit down: I had some questions to ask him. But when he

<P>complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such horror had I of the

<P>possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had just

<P>left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host was a

<P>respectable-looking, middle-aged man.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know Thornfield Hall, of course?' I managed to say
at last.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, ma'am; I lived there once.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you?' Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger
to me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler,' he added.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the
blow I

<P>had been trying to evade.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The late!' I gasped. 'Is he dead?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father,' he

<P>explained. I breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully

<P>assured by these words that Mr. Edward- my Mr. Rochester (God bless

<P>him, wherever he was!)- was at least alive: was, in short, 'the

<P>present gentleman.' Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all

<P>that was to come- whatever the disclosures might be- with

<P>comparative tranquillity. Since he was not in the grave, I could bear,

<P>I thought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?' I asked,
knowing,

<P>of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the

<P>direct question as to where he really was.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, ma'am- oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you
are a

<P>stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last

<P>autumn,- Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about

<P>harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of

<P>valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be

<P>saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines

<P>arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a

<P>terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At dead of night!' I muttered. Yes, that was ever the
hour of

<P>fatality at Thornfield. 'Was it known how it originated?' I demanded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say
it was

<P>ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,' he

<P>continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking

<P>low, 'that there was a lady- a- a lunatic, kept in the house?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have heard something of it.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am; people
even for

<P>some years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw

<P>her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall;

<P>and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said

<P>Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been

<P>his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since- a very queer

<P>thing.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall
him to

<P>the main fact.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this lady?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This lady, ma'am,' he answered, 'turned out to be Mr.

<P>Rochester's wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest

<P>way. There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr.

<P>Rochester fell in-'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But the fire,' I suggested.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm coming to that, ma'am- that Mr. Edward fell in love
with.

<P>The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was:

<P>he was after her continually. They used to watch him- servants will,

<P>you know, ma'am- and he set store on her past everything: for all,

<P>nobody but him thought her so very handsome. She was a little small

<P>thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I've

<P>heard Leah, the housemaid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough.

<P>Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and

<P>you see, when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are

<P>often like as if they were bewitched. Well, he would marry her.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall tell me this part of the story another time,'
I said;

<P>'but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about

<P>the fire. Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had

<P>any hand in it?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her,
and

<P>nobody but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her

<P>called Mrs. Poole- an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy,

<P>but for one fault- a fault common to a deal of them nurses and

<P>matrons- she kept a private bottle of gin by her, and now and then

<P>took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it:

<P>but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep

<P>after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a

<P>witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her

<P>chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief

<P>that came into her head. They say she had nearly burnt her husband

<P>in his bed once: but I don't know about that. However, on this

<P>night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own,

<P>and then she got down to a lower Storey, and made her way to the

<P>chamber that had been the governess's- (she was like as if she knew

<P>somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)- and she

<P>kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it,

<P>fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for all

<P>Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing
he

<P>had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew

<P>savage- quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man,

<P>but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He

<P>sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance;

<P>but he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life:

<P>and she deserved it- she was a very good woman. Miss Adele, a ward

<P>he had, was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the

<P>gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! did he not leave England?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones

<P>of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost

<P>about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses-

<P>which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener

<P>gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him,

<P>you never saw, ma'am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or

<P>racing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a

<P>courage and a will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy,

<P>you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had

<P>been sunk in the sea before she came to Thornfield Hall.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when
all was

<P>burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and

<P>helped them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her

<P>cell. And then they called out to him that she was on the roof,

<P>where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and

<P>shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and

<P>heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black

<P>hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I

<P>witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through

<P>the skylight on to the roof; we heard him call "Bertha!" We saw him

<P>approach her; and then, ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the

<P>next minute she lay smashed on the pavement.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood
were

<P>scattered.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good God!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He shuddered.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And afterwards?' I urged.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground:
there

<P>are only some bits of walls standing now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Were any other lives lost?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- perhaps it would have been better if there had.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you mean?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Poor Mr. Edward!' he ejaculated, 'I little thought ever
to have

<P>seen it? Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his

<P>first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had

<P>one living: but I pity him, for my part.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said he was alive?' I exclaimed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be
dead.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why? How?' My blood was again running cold. 'Where is
he?' I

<P>demanded. 'Is he in England?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ay- ay- he's in England; he can't get out of England,
I fancy-

<P>he's a fixture now.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract
it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is stone-blind,' he said at last. 'Yes, he is stone-blind,
is

<P>Mr. Edward.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned

<P>strength to ask what had caused this calamity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness,
in a

<P>way, ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out

<P>before him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs.

<P>Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great

<P>crash- all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but

<P>sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him

<P>partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that

<P>Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye

<P>inflamed: he lost the sight of that also. He is now helpless,

<P>indeed- blind and a cripple.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is he? Where does he now live?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty
miles

<P>off: quite a desolate spot.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who is with him?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is
quite broken

<P>down, they say.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you any sort of conveyance?'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can
drive me

<P>to Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice

<P>the hire you usually demand.'
