Some time elapsed before I again gave a lesson in the first class. The
holiday of Whitsuntide occupied three days, and on the fourth it was the
turn of the second division to receive my instructions. As I made the transit
of the <I>carr&eacute;</I>, I observed, as usual, the band of sewers surrounding
Mdlle. Henri. There were only about a dozen of them, but they made as much
noise as might have sufficed for fifty; they seemed very little under her
control. Three or four at once assailed her with importunate requirements;
she looked harassed, she demanded silence, but in vain. She saw me, and
I read in her eye pain that a stranger should witness the insubordination
of her pupils. She seemed to entreat order. Her prayers were useless. Then
I remarked that she compressed her lips and contracted her brow, and her
countenance, if I read it correctly, said, 'I have done my best. I seem
to merit blame notwithstanding. blame me, then, who will.' I passed on.
As I dosed the schoolroom door I heard her say, suddenly and sharply, addressing
one of the eldest and most turbulent of the lot, --</DD>

<DD>
'Amelie Mullenberg, ask me no question, and request of me no assistance,
for a week to come; during that space of time I will neither speak to you
nor help you.'</DD>

<DD>
The words were uttered with emphasis -- nay, with vehemence and a comparative
silence followed. Whether the calm was permanent, I know not; two doors
now closed between me and the <I>carr&eacute;</I>.</DD>

<DD>
Next day was appropriated to the first class. On my arrival I found the
directness seated, as usual, in a chair between the two estrades, and before
her was standing Mdlle. Henri, in an attitude (as it seemed to me) of somewhat
reluctant attention. The directness was knitting and talking at the same
time. Amidst the hum of a large schoolroom it was easy so to speak in the
ear of one person as to be heard by that person alone, and it was thus
Mdlle. Reuter parleyed with her teacher. The face of the latter was a little
flushed, not a little troubled; there was vexation in it -- whence resulting
I know not, for the directness looked very placid indeed. She could not
be scolding in such gentle whispers and with so equable a mien. No; it
was presently proved that her discourse had been of the most friendly tendency,
for I heard the closing words, --</DD>

<DD>
'C'est assez, ma bonne amie; a present je ne veux pas vous retenir davantage.'</DD>

<DD>
Without reply, Mdlle. Henri turned away. Dissatisfaction was plainly evinced
in her face, and a smile, slight and brief, but bitter, distrustful, and,
I thought, scornful, curled her lip as she took her place in the class.
It was a secret, involuntary smile, which lasted but a second; an air of
depression succeeded, chased away presently by one of attention and interest,
when I gave the word for all the pupils to take their reading-books. In
general I hated the reading-lesson it was such a torture to the ear to
listen to their uncouth mouthing of my native tongue, and no effort of
example or precept on my part ever seemed to effect the slightest improvement
in their accent. Today each, in her appropriate key, lisped, stuttered,
mumbled, and jabbered as usual. About fifteen had racked me in turn, and
my auricular nerve was expecting with resignation the discords of the sixteenth,
when a full though low voice read out, in clear, correct English, --</DD>

<DD>
'On his way to Perth the king was met by a Highland woman calling herself
a prophetess. She stood at the side of the ferry by which he was about
to travel to the north, and cried with a loud voice, "My lord the king,
if you pass this water you will never return again alive."' (<I>Vide</I>
the 'History of Scotland.')</DD>

<DD>
I looked up in amazement. The voice was a voice of Albion; the accent was
pure and silvery; it only wanted firmness and assurance to be the counterpart
of what any well-educated lady in Essex or Middlesex might have enounced;
yet the speaker or reader was no other than Mdlle. Henri, in whose grave,
joyless face I saw no mark of consciousness that she had performed any
extraordinary feat. No one else evinced surprise either. Mdlle. Reuter
knitted away assiduously. I was aware, however, that at the conclusion
of the paragraph she had lifted her eyelid and honoured me with a glance
sideways. She did not know the full excellency of the teacher's style of
reading, but she perceived that her accent was not that of the others,
and wanted to discover what I thought. I masked my visage with indifference,
and ordered the next girl to proceed.</DD>

<DD>
When the lesson was over, I took advantage of the confusion caused by breaking
up to approach Mdlle. Henri. She was standing near the window, and retired
as I advanced. She thought I wanted to look out, and did not imagine that
I could have anything to say to her. I took her exercise-book out of her
hand. As I turned over the leaves I addressed her.</DD>

<DD>
'You have had lessons in English before?' I asked.</DD>

<DD>
'No, sir.'</DD>

<DD>
'No! You read very well. You have been in England?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh no!' with some animation.</DD>

<DD>
'You have been in English families?'</DD>

<DD>
Still the answer was 'No.' Here my eye, resting on the flyleaf of the book,
saw written, 'Frances Evans Henri.'</DD>

<DD>
'Your name?' I asked.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, sir.'</DD>

<DD>
My interrogations were cut short. I heard a little rustling behind me,
and close at my back was the directness, professing to be examining the
interior of a desk.</DD>

<DD>
'Mademoiselle,' said she, looking up and addressing the teacher, 'will
you have the goodness to go and stand in the corridor, while the young
ladies are putting on their things, and try to keep some order?'</DD>

<DD>
Mdlle. Henri obeyed.</DD>

<DD>
'What splendid weather!' observed the directness cheerfully, glancing at
the same time from the window. I assented, and was withdrawing. 'What of
your new pupil, monsieur?' continued she, following my retreating steps.
'Is she likely to make progress in English?</DD>

<DD>
'Indeed I can hardly judge. She possesses pretty good accent. Of her real
knowledge of the language I have as yet had no opportunity of forming an
opinion.'</DD>

<DD>
'And her natural capacity, monsieur? I have had my fears about that. Can
you relieve me by an assurance at least of its average power?'</DD>

<DD>
'I see no reason to doubt its average power, mademoiselle, but really I
scarcely know her, and have not had time to study the calibre of her capacity.
I wish you a very good afternoon.'</DD>

<DD>
She still pursued me. 'You will observe, monsieur, and tell me what you
think; I could so much better rely on your opinion than on my own. Women
cannot judge of these things as men can; and, excuse my pertinacity, monsieur,
but it is natural I should feel interested about this poor little girl
(pauvre petite). She has scarcely any relations; her own efforts are all
she has to look to; her acquirements must be her sole fortune. Her present
position has once been mine, or nearly so; it is then but natural I should
sympathize with her; and sometimes, when I see the difficulty she has in
managing pupils, I feel quite chagrined. I doubt not she does her best;
her intentions are excellent; but, monsieur, she wants tact and firmness.
I have talked to her on the subject, but I am not fluent, and probably
did not express myself with clearness; she never appears to comprehend
me. Now, would you occasionally, when you see an opportunity, slip in a
word of advice to her on the subject? Men have so much more influence than
women have -- they argue so much more logically than we do; and you, monsieur,
in particular, have so paramount a power of making yourself obeyed. A word
of advice from you could not but do her good. Even if she were sullen and
headstrong (which I hope she is not) she would scarcely refuse to listen
to you. For my own part, I can truly say that I never attend one of your
lessons without deriving benefit from witnessing your management of the
pupils. The other masters are a constant source of anxiety to me; they
cannot impress the young ladies with sentiments of respect, nor restrain
the levity natural to youth. In you, monsieur, I feel the most absolute
confidence. Try, then, to put this poor child into the way of controlling.
our giddy, high-spirited Brabantoises. But, monsieur, I would add one word
more: don't alarm her <I>amour propre</I>, beware of inflicting a wound
there. I reluctantly admit that in that particular she is blamably -- some
would say ridiculously -- susceptible. I fear I have touched this sore
point inadvertently, and she cannot get over it.'</DD>

<DD>
During the greater part of this harangue my hand was on the lock of the
outer door. I now turned it.</DD>

<DL>'An revoir, mademoiselle,' said I, and I escaped. I saw the directress's
stock of words was yet far from exhausted. She looked after me; she would
fain have detained me longer. Her manner towards me had been altered ever
since I had begun to treat her with hardness and indifference. She almost
cringed to me on every occasion; she consulted my countenance incessantly,
and beset me with innumerable little officious attentions. Servility creates
despotism. This slavish homage, instead of softening my heart, only pampered
whatever was stern and exacting in its mood. The very circumstance of her
hovering round me like a fascinated bird seemed to transform me into a
rigid pillar of stone; her Batteries irritated my scorn, her blandishments
confirmed my reserve. At times I wondered what she meant by giving herself
such trouble to win me, when the more profitable Pelet was already in her
nets, and when, too, she was aware that I possessed her secret -- for I
had not scrupled to tell her as much; but the fact is that as it was her
nature to doubt the reality and undervalue the worth of modesty, affection,
disinterestedness -- to regard these qualities as foibles of character
-- so it was equally her tendency to consider pride, hardness, selfishness,
as proofs of strength. She would trample on the neck of humility, she would
kneel at the feet of disdain; she would meet tenderness with secret contempt,
indifference she would woo with ceaseless assiduities. Benevolence, devotedness,
enthusiasm were her antipathies; for dissimulation and self-interest she
had a preference -- they were real wisdom in her eyes. Moral and physical
degradation, mental and bodily inferiority she regarded with indulgence:
they were foils capable of being turned to good account as set-offs for
her own endowments. To violence, injustice, tyranny, she succumbed: they
were her natural masters. She had no propensity to hate, no impulse to
resist them; the indignation their behests awake in some hearts was unknown
in hers. From all this it resulted that the false and selfish called her
wise, the vulgar and debased termed her charitable, the insolent and unjust
dubbed her amiable, the conscientious and benevolent generally at first
accepted as valid her claim to be considered one of themselves; but ere
long the plating of pretension wore off, the real material appeared below,
and they laid her aside as a deception.
