A week is gone; <I>le jour des noces</I> arrived; the marriage was solemnized
at St. Jacques; Mdlle. Zora&iuml;de became Madame Pelet, <I>n&eacute;e</I>
Reuter; and in about an hour after this transformation 'the happy pair,'
as newspapers phrase it, were on their way to Paris, where, according to
previous arrangement, the honeymoon was to be spent. The next day I quitted
the <I>pensionnat</I>. Myself and my chattels (some books and clothes)
were soon transferred to a modest lodging I had hired in a street not far
off. In half an hour my clothes were arranged in a commode, my books on
a shelf, and the 'flitting' was effected. I should not have been unhappy
that day had not one pang tortured me -- a longing to go to the Rue Notre
Dame aux Neiges, resisted, yet irritated by an inward resolve to avoid
that street till such time as the mist of doubt should clear from my prospects.</DD>

<DD>
It was a sweet September evening -- very mild, very still. I had nothing
to do. At that hour I knew Frances would he equally released from occupation.
I thought she might possibly be wishing for her master. I knew I wished
for my pupil. Imagination began with her low whispers, infusing into my
soul the soft tale of pleasures that might be.</DD>

<DD>
'You will find her reading or writing,' said she; 'you can take your seat
at her side; you need not startle her peace by undue excitement; you need
not embarrass her manner by unusual action or language. Be as you always
are; look over what she has written; listen while she reads; chide her,
or quietly approve. You know the effect of either system; you know her
smile when pleased; you know the play of her looks when roused; you have
the secret of awakening what expression you will, and you can choose amongst
that pleasant variety. With you she will sit silent as long as it suits
you to talk alone; you can hold her under a potent spell. Intelligent as
she is, eloquent as she can be, you can seal her lips, and veil her bright
countenance with diffidence. Yet, you know, she is not all monotonous mildness;
you have seen, with a sort of strange pleasure, revolt, scorn, austerity,
bitterness, lay energetic claim to a place in her feelings and physiognomy.
you know that few could rule her as you do; you know she might break but
never bend under the hand of Tyranny and Injustice but Reason and Affection
can guide her by a sign. Try their influence now. Go -- they are not passions;
you may handle them safely.'</DD>

<DD>
'I will <I>not</I> go,' was my answer to the sweet temptress. 'A man is
master of himself to a certain point, but not beyond it. Could I seek Frances
to-night, could I sit with her alone in a quiet room, and address her only
in the language of reason and affection?'</DD>

<DD>
'No,' was the brief, fervent reply of that love which had conquered and
now controlled me.</DD>

<DD>
Time seemed to stagnate; the sun would not go down; my watch ticked, but
I thought the hands were paralysed.</DD>

<DD>
'What a hot evening!' I cried, throwing open the lattice for, indeed, I
had seldom felt so feverish. Hearing a step ascending the common stair,
I wondered whether the <I>locataire</I>, now mounting to his apartments,
were as unsettled in mind and condition as I was, or whether he lived in
the calm of certain resources and in the freedom of unfettered feelings.
What! was he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in inaudible
thought? He had actually knocked at the door -- at <I>my</I> door -- a
smart, prompt rap; and almost before I could invite him in he was over
the threshold, and had closed the door behind him.</DD>

<DD>
'And how are you?' asked an indifferent, quiet voice, in the English language,
while my visitor, without any sort of bustle or introduction, put his hat
on the table and his gloves into his hat, and drawing the only armchair
the room afforded a little forward, seated himself tranquilly therein.</DD>

<DD>
'Can't you speak?' he inquired in a few moments, in a tone whose nonchalance
seemed to intimate that it was much the same thing whether I answered or
not. The fact is, I found it desirable to have recourse to my good friends
<I>les b&eacute;sicles</I>, not exactly to ascertain the identity of my
visitor -- for I already knew him, confound his impudence! -- but to see
how he looked, to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance. I wiped
the glasses very deliberately, and put them on quite as deliberately, adjusting
them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose or get entangled in my short
tufts of dun hair. I was sitting in the window-seat, with my back to the
light, and I had him <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> -- a position he would much
rather have had reversed, for at any time he preferred scrutinizing to
being scrutinized. Yes, it was <I>he</I>, and no mistake, with his six
feet of length arranged in a sitting attitude, with his dark travelling
surtout with its velvet collar, his gray pantaloons, his black stock, and
<I>his</I> face, the most original one Nature ever modelled, yet the least
obtrusively so -- not one feature that could be termed marked or odd, yet
the effect of the whole unique. There is no use in attempting. to describe
what is indescribable. Being in no hurry to address him, I sat and stared
at my ease.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, that's your game, is it?' said he at last. 'Well, we'll see which
is soonest tired.' And he slowly drew out a fine cigar-case, picked one
to his taste, lit it, took a book from the shelf convenient to his hand,
then leaning back, proceeded to smoke and read as tranquilly as if he had
been in his own room in Grove Street, X--shire, England. I knew he was
capable of continuing in that attitude till midnight, if he conceived the
whim; so I rose, and taking the book from his hand, I said, --</DD>

<DD>
'You did not ask for it, and you shall not have it.'</DD>

<DD>
'It is silly and dull,' he observed, 'so I have not lost much;' then, the
spell being broken, he went on. 'I thought you lived at Pelet's. I went
there this afternoon, expecting to be starved to death by sitting in a
boarding-school drawing-room, and they told me you were gone -- had departed
this morning. You had left your address behind you though, which I wondered
at; it was a more practical and sensible precaution than I should have
imagined you capable of. Why did you leave?</DD>

<DD>
'Because M. Pelet has just married the lady whom you and Mr. Brown assigned
to me as my wife.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, indeed!' replied Hunsden, with a short laugh. 'So you've lost both
your wife and your place?'</DD>

<DD>
'Precisely so.'</DD>

<DD>
I saw him give a quick, covert glance all round my room; he marked its
narrow limits, its scanty furniture. In an instant he had comprehended
the state of matters -- had absolved me from the crime of prosperity. A
curious effect this discovery wrought in his strange mind. I am morally
certain that if he had found me installed in a handsome parlour, lounging
on a soft couch, with a pretty, wealthy wife at my side, he would have
hated me. A brief, cold, haughty visit would in such a case have been the
extreme limit of his civilities, and never would he have come near me more
so long as the tide of fortune bore me smoothly on its surface; but the
painted furniture, the bare walls, the cheerless solitude of my room relaxed
his rigid pride, and I know not what softening change had taken place both
in his voice and look ere he spoke again.</DD>

<DD>
'You have got another place?'</DD>

<DD>
'No.</DD>

<DD>
'You are in the way of getting one?'</DD>

<DD>
'No.'</DD>

<DD>
'That is bad. Have you applied to Brown?'</DD>

<DD>
'No, indeed.'</DD>

<DD>
'You had better; he often has it in his power to give useful information
in such matters.</DD>

<DD>
'He served me once very well; I have no claim on him, and am not in the
humour to bother him again.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, if you're bashful, and dread being intrusive, you need only commission
me. I shall see him to-night; I can put in a word.</DD>

<DD>
'I beg you will not, Mr. Hunsden; I am in your debt already. You did me
an important service when I was at X--; got me out of a den where I was
dying. That service I have never repaid, and at present I decline positively
adding another item to the account.'</DD>

<DD>
'If the wind sits that way, I'm satisfied. I thought my unexampled generosity
in turning you out of that accursed counting-house would be duly appreciated
some day. "Cast your bread on the waters, and it shall be found after many
days," say the Scriptures. Yes, that's right, lad; make much of me -- I'm
a nonpareil. There's nothing like me in the common herd. In the meantime,
to put all humbug aside and talk sense for a few moments, you would be
greatly the better of a situation, and what is more, you are a fool if
you refuse to take one from any hand that offers it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very well, Mr. Hunsden. Now you have settled that point, talk of something
else. What news from X--?'</DD>

<DD>
'I have not settled that point, or at least there is another to settle
before we get to X--. Is this Miss Z&eacute;nobie' ('Zora&iuml;de,' interposed
I) -- 'well, Zora&iuml;de -- is she really married to Pelet?'</DD>

<DD>
'I tell you yes; and if you don't believe me, go and ask the cur&eacute;
of St. Jacques.'</DD>

<DD>
'And your heart is broken?'</DD>

<DD>
'I am not aware that it is. It feels all right -- beats as usual.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then your feelings are less superfine than I took them to be. You must
be a coarse, callous character to bear such a thwack with- out staggering
under it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Staggering under it? What the deuce is there to stagger under in the circumstance
of a Belgian schoolmistress marrying a French schoolmaster? The progeny
will doubtless be a strange hybrid race; but that's their lookout, not
mine.'</DD>

<DD>
'He indulges in scurrilous jests, and the bride was his affianced one!'</DD>

<DD>
'Who said so?'</DD>

<DD>
'Brown.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll tell you what, Hunsden: Brown is an old gossip.'</DD>

<DD>
'He is; but in the meantime, if his gossip be founded on less than fact,
if you took no particular interest in Miss Zora&iuml;de, why, O youthful
pedagogue, did you leave your place in consequence of her becoming Madame
Pelet?'</DD>

<DD>
'Because' -- I felt my face grow a little hot -- 'because, in short, Mr.
Hunsden, I decline answering any more questions;' and I plunged my hands
deep in my breeches pocket.</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden triumphed; his eyes, his laugh announced victory.</DD>

<DD>
'What the deuce are you laughing at, Mr. Hunsden?'</DD>

<DD>
'At your exemplary composure. Well, lad, I'll not bore you. I see how it
is. Zora&iuml;de has jilted you -- married some one richer, as any sensible
woman would have done if she had had the chance.'</DD>

<DD>
I made no reply, I let him think so, not feeling inclined to enter into
an explanation of the real state of things, and as little to forge a false
account. But it was not easy to blind Hunsden. My very silence, instead
of convincing him that he had hit the truth, seemed to render him doubtful
about it. He went on, --</DD>

<DD>
'I suppose the affair has been conducted as such affairs always are amongst
rational people. You offered her your youth and your talents -- such as
they are -- in exchange for her position and money. I don't suppose you
took appearance, or what is called <I>love</I>, into the account -- for
I understand she is older than you, and Brown says rather sensible looking
than beautiful. She having then no chance of making a better bargain, was
at first inclined to come to terms with you; but Pelet, the head of a flourishing
school, stepped in with a higher bid. She accepted, and he has got her:
a correct transaction -- perfectly so -- business-like and legitimate.
And now we'll talk of something else.'</DD>

<DD>
'Do,' said I, very glad to dismiss the topic, and especially glad to have
baffled the sagacity of my cross-questioner -- if indeed, I had baffled
it; for though his words now led away from the dangerous point, his eyes,
keen and watchful, seemed still preoccupied with the former idea.</DD>

<DD>
'You want to hear news from X--? And what interest can you have in X--?
You left no friends there, for you made none. Nobody ever asks after you,
neither man nor woman; and if I mention your name in company, the men look
as if I had spoken of Prester John, and the women sneer covertly. Our X--
belles must have disliked you. How did you excite their displeasure?'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know. I seldom spoke to them -- they were nothing to me. I considered
them only as something to be glanced at from a distance. Their dresses
and faces were often pleasing enough to the eye, but I could not understand
their conversation, nor even read their countenances. When I caught snatches
of what they said, I could never make much of it; and the play of their
lips and eyes did not help me at all.'</DD>

<DD>
'That was your fault, not theirs. There are sensible as well as handsome
women in X--. women it is worth any man's while to talk to, and with whom
I can talk with pleasure. But you had and have no pleasant address; there
is nothing in you to induce a woman to be affable. I have remarked you
sitting near the door in a room full of company, bent on hearing, not on
speaking; on observing, not on entertaining; looking frigidly shy at the
commencement of a party, confusingly vigilant about the middle, and insultingly
weary towards the end. Is that the way, do you think, ever to communicate
pleasure or excite interest? No; and if you are generally unpopular, it
is because you deserve to be so.'</DD>

<DD>
'Content!' I ejaculated.</DD>

<DD>
'No, you are not content. You see beauty always turning its back on you;
you are mortified, and then you sneer. I verify believe all that is desirable
on earth -- wealth, reputation, love -- will for ever to you be the ripe
grapes on the high trellis. You'll look up at them; they will tantalize
in you the lust of the eye; but they are out of reach. You have not the
address to fetch a ladder, and you'll go away calling them sour.'</DD>

<DD>
Cutting as these words n-tight have been under some circumstances, they
drew no blood now. My life was changed, my experience had been varied since
I left X--; but Hunsden could not know this. He had seen me only in the
character of Mr. Crimsworth's clerk -- a dependant amongst wealthy strangers,
meeting disdain with a hard front, conscious of an unsocial and unattractive
exterior, refusing to sue for notice which I was sure would be withheld,
declining to evince an admiration which I knew would be scorned as worthless.
He could not be aware that since then youth and loveliness had been to
me everyday objects, that I had studied them at leisure and closely, and
had seen the plain texture of truth under the embroidery of appearance;
nor could he, keen-sighted as he was, penetrate into my heart, search my
brain, and read my peculiar sympathies and antipathies. He had not known
me long enough or well enough to perceive how low my feelings would ebb
under some influences, powerful over most minds; how high, how fast they
would flow under other influences, that perhaps acted with the more intense
force on me because they acted on me alone. Neither could he suspect for
an instant the history of my communications with Mdlle. Reuter. Secret
to him and to all others was the tale of her strange infatuation. Her blandishments,
her wiles had been seen but by me, and to me only were they known. but
they had changed me, for they had proved that I <I>could</I> impress. A
sweeter secret nestled deeper in my heart, one full of tenderness and as
full of strength. It took the sting out of Hunsden's sarcasm; it kept me
unbent by shame and unstirred by wrath. But, of all this I could say nothing
-- nothing decisive at least; uncertainty sealed my lips, and during the
interval of silence by which alone I replied to Mr. Hunsden, I made up
my mind to be for the present wholly misjudged by him, and misjudged I
was. He thought he had been rather too hard upon me, and that I was crushed
by the weight of his upbraidings; so to reassure me he said doubtless I
should mend some day. I was only at the beginning of life yet; and since
happily I was not quite without sense, every false step I made would be
a good lesson.</DD>

<DD>
Just then I turned my face a little to the light. The approach of twilight
and my position in the window-seat had, for the last ten minutes, prevented
him from studying my countenance; as I moved, however, he caught an expression
which he thus interpreted, --</DD>

<DD>
'Confound it! How doggedly self-approving the lad looks! I thought he was
fit to die with shame, and there he sits grinning smiles, as good as to
say, "Let the world wag as it will, I've the philosopher's stone in my
waistcoat pocket and the elixir of life in my cupboard; I'm independent
of both fate and fortune!"</DD>

<DD>
'Hunsden, you spoke of grapes; I was thinking of a fruit I like better
than your X-- hothouse grapes -- a unique fruit, growing wild, which I
have marked as my own, and hope one day to gather and taste. It is of no
use your offering me the draught of bitterness or threatening me with death
by thirst. I have the anticipation of sweetness on MY palate, the hope
of freshness on my lips; I can reject the unsavoury and endure the exhausting.'</DD>

<DD>
'For how long?'</DD>

<DD>
'Till the next opportunity for effort; and as the prize of success will
be a treasure after my own heart, I'll bring a bull's strength to the struggle.'</DD>

<DD>
'Bad luck crushes bulls as easily as bullaces; and, I believe, the fury
dogs you. You were born with a wooden spoon in your mouth, depend on it.'</DD>

<DD>
'I believe you; and I mean to make my wooden spoon do the work of some
people's silver ladles. Grasped firmly and handled nimbly, even a wooden
spoon will shovel up broth.'</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden rose. 'I see,' said he. 'I suppose you're one of those who develop
best unwatched and act best unaided. Work your own way. Now, I'll go.'
And without another word he was going; at the door he turned.</DD>

<DD>
'Crimsworth Hall is sold,' said he.</DD>

<DD>
'Sold!' was my echo.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes. You know, of course, that your brother failed three months ago?'</DD>

<DD>
'What! Edward Crimsworth?'</DD>

<DD>
'Precisely; and his wife went home to her father's. When affairs went awry
his temper sympathized with them. He used her ill. I told you he would
be a tyrant to her some day. As to him --'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, as to him -- what is become of him?'</DD>

<DD>
'Nothing extraordinary; don't be alarmed. He put himself under the protection
of the court, compounded with his creditors -- ten-pence in the pound --
in six weeks set up again, coaxed back his wife, and is flourishing like
a green bay tree.'</DD>

<DD>
'And Crimsworth Hall -- was the furniture sold too?'</DD>

<DD>
'Everything -- from the grand piano down to the rolling-pin.'</DD>

<DD>
'And the contents of the oak dining-room -- were they sold?'</DD>

<DD>
'Of course. Why should the sofas and chairs of that room be held more sacred
than those of any other?'</DD>

<DD>
'And the pictures?'</DD>

<DD>
'What pictures? Crimsworth had no special collection that I know of. He
did not profess to be an amateur.'</DD>

<DD>
'There were two portraits, one on each side the mantelpiece. You cannot
have forgotten them, Mr. Hunsden; you once noticed that of the lady --'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, I know! the thin-faced gentlewoman with a shawl put on like drapery.
Why, as a matter of course, it would be sold among the other things. If
you had been rich, you might have bought it, for I remember you said it
represented your mother. You see what it is to be without a sou.'</DD>

<DD>
I did. 'But surely,' I thought to myself, 'I shall not always be so poverty-stricken;
I may one day buy it back yet.' -- 'Who purchased it? Do you know?' I asked.</DD>

<DD>
'How is it likely? I never inquired who purchased anything. There spoke
the unpractical man -- to imagine all the world is interested in what interests
himself! Now, goodnight; I'm off for Germany to-morrow morning. I shall
be back here in six weeks, and possibly I may call and see you again. I
wonder whether you'll be still out of place!' he laughed, as mockingly,
as heartlessly as Mephistopheles, and so laughing, vanished.</DD>

<DD>
Some people, however indifferent they may become after a considerable space
of absence, always contrive to leave a pleasant impression just at parting.
Not so Hunsden. A conference with him affected one like a draught of Peruvian
bark: it seemed a concentration of the specially harsh, stringent, bitter.
Whether, Eke bark, it invigorated, I scarcely knew.</DD>

<DD>
A ruffled mind makes a restless pillow. I slept little on the night after
this interview. Towards morning I began to doze, but hardly had my slumber
become sleep when I was roused from it by hearing a noise in my sitting-room,
to which my bedroom adjoined -- a step and a shoving of furniture. The
movement lasted barely two minutes; with the closing of the door it ceased.
I listened: not a mouse stirred. Perhaps I had dreamt it; perhaps a <I>locataire</I>
had made a mistake and entered my apartment instead of his own. It was
yet but five o'clock; neither I nor the day was wide awake. I turned, and
was soon unconscious. When I did rise, about two hours later, I had for-
gotten the circumstance. The first thing I saw, however, on quitting my
chamber, recalled it. Just pushed in at the door of my sitting- room, and
still standing on end, was a wooden packing-case -- a rough deal affair,
wide but shallow. A porter had doubtless shoved it forward, but seeing
no occupant of the room, had left it at the entrance.</DD>

<DD>
'That is none of mine,' thought I, approaching; 'it must be meant for somebody
else.' I stooped to examine the address: --</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
'Wm. Crimsworth, Esq., No. --, -- St., Brussels.'</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
I was puzzled, but concluding that the best way to obtain information was
to ask within, I cut the cords and opened the case. Green baize enveloped
its contents, sewn carefully at the sides. I ripped the pack-thread with
my penknife, and still, as the seam gave way, glimpses of gilding appeared
through the widening interstices. Boards and baize being at length removed,
I lifted from the case a large picture, in a magnificent frame. Leaning
it against a chair, in a position where the light from the window fell
favourably upon it, I stepped back; already I had mounted my spectacles.
A portrait-painter's sky (the most sombre and threatening of welkins) and
distant trees of a conventional depth of hue raised in full relief a pale,
pensive-looking female face, shadowed with soft dark hair, almost blending
with the equally dark clouds; large, solemn eyes looked reflectively into
mine; a thin cheek rested on a delicate little hand, a shawl, artistically
draped, half hid, half showed a slight figure. A listener (had there been
one) might have heard me, after ten minutes' silent gazing, utter the word
'Mother!' I might have said more, but with me the first word uttered aloud
in soliloquy rouses consciousness; it reminds me that only crazy people
talk to themselves, and then I think out my monologue instead of speaking
it. I had thought a long while, and a long while had contemplated the intelligence,
the sweetness, and, alas! the sadness also of those fine gray eyes, the
mental power of that forehead, and the rare sensibility of that serious
mouth, when my glance, travelling downwards, fell on a narrow billet, stuck
in the corner of the picture, between the frame and the canvas. Then I
first asked, 'Who sent this picture? Who thought of me, saved it out of
the wreck of Crimsworth Hall, and now commits it to the care of its natural
keeper?' I took the note from its niche thus it spoke: --</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
'There is a sort of stupid pleasure in giving a child sweets, a fool his
bells, a dog a bone. You are repaid by seeing the child besmear his face
with sugar, by witnessing how the fool's ecstasy makes a greater fool of
him than ever, by watching the dog's nature come out over his bone. In
giving William Crimsworth his mother's picture, I give him sweets, bells,
and bone all in one. What grieves me is that I cannot behold the result.
I would have added five shillings more to my bid if the auctioneer could
only have promised me that pleasure.</DD>

<DIV ALIGN=right>
<DD>
H. Y. H.</DD></DIV>

<DD>
'<I>P.S.</I> -- You said last night you positively declined adding another
item to your account with me. Don't you think I've saved you that trouble?'</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
I muffled the picture in its green baize covering, restored it to the case,
and having transported the whole concern to my bedroom, put it out of sight
under my bed. My pleasure was now poisoned by pungent pain; I determined
to look no more till I could look at my ease. If Hunsden had come in at
that moment, I should have said to him, 'I owe you nothing, Hunsden --
not a fraction of a farthing; you have paid yourself in taunts.'</DD>

<DD>
Too anxious to remain any longer quiescent, I had no sooner breakfasted
than I repaired once more to M. Vandenhuten's, scarcely hoping to find
him at home -- for a week had barely elapsed since my first call -- but
fancying I might be able to glean information as to the time when his return
was expected. A better result awaited me than I had anticipated; for though
the family were yet at Ostend, M. Vandenhuten had come over to Brussels
on business for the day. He received me with the quiet kindness of a sincere
though not excitable man. I had not sat five minutes alone with him in
his bureau before I became aware of a sense of ease in his presence such
as I rarely experienced with strangers. I was surprised at my own composure,
for, after all, I had come on business to me exceedingly painful -- that
of soliciting a favour. I asked on what basis the calm rested. I feared
it might be deceptive. Ere long I caught a glimpse of the ground, and at
once I felt assured of its solidity; I knew where I was.</DD>

<DD>
M. Vandenhuten was rich, respected, and influential; I poor, despised,
and powerless. So we stood to the world at large as members of the world's
society; but to each other, as a pair of human beings, our positions were
reversed. The Dutchman (he was not Flamand, but pure Hollandais) was slow,
cool, of rather dense intelligence, though sound and accurate judgment:
the Englishman far more nervous, active, quicker both to plan and to practise,
to conceive and to realize. The Dutchman was benevolent, the Englishman
susceptible; in short, our characters dovetailed, but my mind having more
fire and action than his, instinctively assumed and kept the predominance.</DD>

<DD>
This point settled, and my position well ascertained, I addressed him on
the subject of my affairs with that genuine frankness which full confidence
can alone inspire. It was a pleasure to him to be so appealed to; he thanked
me for giving him this opportunity of using a little exertion in my behalf.
I went on to explain to him that my wish was not so much to be helped as
to be put into the way of helping myself; of him I did not want exertion
-- that was to be my part -- but only information and recommendation. Soon
after I rose to go. He held out his hand at parting -- an action of greater
significance with foreigners than with Englishmen. As I exchanged a smile
with him, I thought the benevolence of his truthful face was better than
the intelligence of my own. Characters of my order experience a balm-like
solace in the contact of such souls as animated the honest breast of Victor
Vandenhuten.</DD>

The next fortnight was a period of many alternations; my existence during
its lapse resembled a sky of one of those autumnal nights which are specially
haunted by meteors and falling stars. Hopes and fears, expectations and
disappointments, descended in glancing showers from zenith to horizon;
but all were transient, and darkness followed swift each vanishing apparition.
M. Vandenhuten aided me faithfully. He set me on the track of several places,
and himself made efforts to secure them for me; but for a long time solicitation
and recommendation were vain -- the door either shut in my face when I
was about to walk in, or another candidate, entering before me, rendered
my further advance useless. Feverish and roused, no disappointment arrested
me. defeat following fast on defeat served as stimulants to will. I forgot
fastidiousness, conquered reserve, thrust pride from me; I asked, I persevered,
I remonstrated, I dunned. It is so that openings are forced into the guarded
circle where Fortune sits dealing favours round. My perseverance made me
known; my importunity made me remarked. I was inquired about; my former
pupils' parents, gathering the reports of their children, heard me spoken
of as talented, and they echoed the word. The sound, bandied about at random,
came at last to ears which, but for its universality, it might never have
reached; and at the very crisis when I had tried my last effort, and knew
not what to do, Fortune looked in at me one morning, as I sat in drear
and almost desperate deliberation on my bedstead, nodded with the familiarity
of an old acquaintance -- though God knows I had never met her before --
and threw a prize into my lap.</DD>

In the second week of October 18-- I got the appointment of English professor
to all the classes of -- College, Brussels, with a salary of three thousand
francs per annum, and the certainty of being able, by dint of the reputation
and publicity accompanying the position, to make as much more by private
lessons. The official notice which communicated this information mentioned
also that it was the strong recommendation of M. Vandenhuten, n&eacute;gociant,
which had turned the scale of choice in my favour.</DD>

<DD>
No sooner had I read the announcement than I hurried to M. Vandenhuten's
bureau, pushed the document under his nose, and when he had perused it,
took both his hands and thanked him with unrestrained vivacity. My vivid
words and emphatic gesture moved his Dutch calm to unwonted sensation.
He said he was happy -- glad to have served me, but he had done nothing
meriting such thanks. He had not laid out a centime, only scratched a few
words on a sheet of paper.</DD>

<DD>
Again I repeated to him, --</DD>

<DD>
'You have made me quite happy, and in a way that suits me. I do not feel
an obligation irksome, conferred by your kind hand; I do not feel disposed
to shun you because you have done me a favour. From this day you must consent
to admit me to your intimate acquaintance, for I shall hereafter recur
again and again to the pleasure of your society.'</DD>

<DL>'Ainsi soit-il,' was the reply, accompanied by a smile of benignant
content. I went away with its sunshine in my heart.</DL>
