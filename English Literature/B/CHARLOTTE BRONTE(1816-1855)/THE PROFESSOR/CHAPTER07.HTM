<DD>
Reader, perhaps you were in Belgium? Haply you don't know the physiognomy
of the country? You have not its lineaments defined upon your memory as
I have them on mine?</DD>

<DD>
Three -- nay, four -- pictures line the four-walled cell where are stored
for me the records of the past. First, Eton. All in that picture is in
far perspective, receding, diminutive, but freshly coloured, green, dewy,
with a spring sky, piled with glittering yet showery clouds; for my childhood
was not all sunshine -- it had its overcast, its cold, its stormy hours.
Second, X--, huge, dingy; the canvas cracked and smoked; a yellow sky,
sooty clouds; no sun, no azure. the verdure of the suburbs blighted and
sullied -- a very dreary scene.</DD>

<DD>
Third, Belgium; and I will pause before this landscape. As to the fourth,
a curtain covers it, which I may hereafter withdraw, or may not, as suits
my convenience and capacity. At any rate, for the present it must hang
undisturbed. Belgium! name unromantic and unpoetic, yet name that whenever
uttered has in my ear a sound, in my heart an echo, such as no other assemblage
of syllables, however sweet or classic, can produce. Belgium! I repeat
the word now as I sit alone near midnight. It stirs my world of the past
like a summons to resurrection. The graves unclose, the dead are raised;
thoughts, feelings, memories that slept are seen by me ascending from the
clods, haloed most of them; but while I gaze on their vapoury forms, and
strive to ascertain definitely their outline, the sound which wakened them
dies, and they sink, each and all, like a light wreath of mist, absorbed
in the mould, recalled to urns, resealed in monuments. Farewell, luminous
phantoms!</DD>

<DD>
This is Belgium, reader. Look! Don't call the picture a flat or a dull
one; it was neither flat nor dull to me when I first beheld it. When I
left Ostend on a mild February morning, and found myself on the road to
Brussels, nothing could look vapid to me. My sense of enjoyment possessed
an edge whetted to the finest, untouched, keen, exquisite. I was young;
I had good health. Pleasure and I had never met; no indulgence of hers
had enervated or sated one faculty of my nature. Liberty I clasped in my
arms for the first time, and the influence of her smile and embrace revived
my life like the sun and the west wind. Yes, at that epoch I felt like
a morning traveller who doubts not that from the hill he is ascending he
shall behold a glorious sunrise. What if the track be strait, steep, and
stony? He sees it not. His eyes are fixed on that summit, flushed already,
flushed and gilded; and having gained it, he is certain of the scene beyond.
He knows that the sun will face him, that his chariot is even now coming
over the eastern horizon, and that the herald breeze he feels on his cheek
is opening for the god's career a clear, vast path of azure, amidst clouds
soft as pearl and warm as flame. Difficulty and toil were to be my lot,
but sustained by energy, drawn on by hopes as bright as vague, I deemed
such a lot no hardship. I mounted now the hill in shade, There were pebbles,
inequalities, briars in my path, but my eyes were fixed on the crimson
peak above; my imagination was with the refulgent firmament beyond, and
I thought nothing of the stones turning under my feet or of the thorns
scratching my face and hands.</DD>

<DD>
I gazed often, and always with delight, from the window of the <I>diligence</I>
(these, be it remembered, were not the days of trains and railroads). Well,
and what did I see? I will tell you faithfully. Green, reedy swamps; fields
fertile but flat, cultivated in patches that made them look like magnified
kitchen-gardens; belts of cut trees, formal as pollard willows, skirting
the horizon; narrow canals, gliding slow by the roadside; painted Flemish
farm-houses; some very dirty hovels; a gray, dead sky; wet road, wet fields,
wet house-tops. Not a beautiful, scarcely a picturesque object met my eye
along the whole route, yet to me all was beautiful, all was more than picturesque.
It continued fair so long as daylight lasted, though the moisture of many
preceding damp days had sodden the whole country. As it grew dark, however,
the rain recommenced, and it was through streaming and starless darkness
my eye caught the first gleam of the lights of Brussels. I saw little of
the city but its lights that night. Having alighted from the <I>diligence</I>,
a <I>fiacre</I> conveyed me to the Hotel de --, where I had been advised
by a fellow-traveller to put up. Having eaten a traveller's supper, I retired
to bed, and slept a traveller's sleep.</DD>

<DD>
Next morning I awoke from prolonged and sound repose with the impression
that I was yet in X--, and perceiving it to be broad daylight, I started
up, imagining that I had overslept myself and should be behind time at
the counting-house. The momentary and painful sense of restraint vanished
before the revived and reviving consciousness of freedom, as, throwing
back the white curtains of my bed, I looked forth into a wide, lofty, foreign
chamber. How different from the small and dingy, though not uncomfortable,
apartment I had occupied for a night or two at a respectable inn in London
while waiting for the sailing of the packet! Yet far be it from me to profane
the memory of that little dingy room! It too is dear to my soul; for there,
as I lay in quiet and darkness, I first heard the great bell of St. Paul's
telling London it was midnight; and well do I recall the deep, deliberate
tones, so full charged with colossal phlegm and force. From the small,
narrow window of that room I first saw <I>the</I> dome, looming through
a London mist. I suppose the sensations, stirred by those first sounds,
first sights, are felt but once. Treasure them, Memory; seal them in urns,
and keep them in safe niches. Well I rose. Travellers talk of the apartments
in foreign dwellings being bard and uncomfortable: I thought my chamber
looked stately and cheerful. It had such large windows -- <I>crois&eacute;es</I>
that opened like doors, with such broad, clear panes of glass; such a great
looking-glass stood on my dressing-table; such a fine mirror glittered
over the mantelpiece; the painted floor looked so clean and glossy. When
I had dressed and was descending the stairs, the broad marble steps almost
awed me, and so did the lofty hall into which they conducted. On the first
landing I met a Flemish housemaid. She had wooden shoes, a short red petticoat,
a printed cotton bedgown; her face was broad, her physiognomy eminently
stupid. When I spoke to her in French she answered me in Flemish, with
an air the reverse of civil. Yet I thought her charming. If she was not
pretty or polite, she was, I conceived, very picturesque; she reminded
me of the female figures in certain Dutch paintings I had seen in other
years at Seacombe Hall.</DD>

<DD>
I repaired to the public room. That too was very large and very lofty,
and warmed by a stove. The floor was black, and the stove was black, and
most of the furniture was black; yet I never experienced a freer sense
of exhilaration than when I sat down at a very long, black table (covered,
however, in part by a white cloth), and having ordered breakfast, began
to pour out my coffee from a little black coffee-pot. The stove might be
dismal-looking to some eyes, not to mine, but it was indisputably very
warm, and there were two gentlemen seated by it talking in French. Impossible
to follow their rapid utterance, or comprehend much of the purport of what
they said, yet French, in the mouths of Frenchmen or Belgians (I was not
then sensible of the horrors of the Belgian accent), was as music to my
ears. One of these gentlemen presently discerned me to be an Englishman,
no doubt from the fashion in which I addressed the waiter, for I would
persist in speaking French in my execrable South-of-England style, though
the man understood English. The gentleman, after looking towards me once
or twice, politely accosted me in very good English. I remember I wished
to God that I could speak French as well; his fluency and correct pronunciation
impressed me for the first time with a due notion of the cosmopolitan character
of the capital I was in. It was my first experience of that skill in living
languages I afterwards found to be so general in Brussels.</DD>

<DD>
I lingered over my breakfast as long as I could. While it was there on
the table, and while that stranger continued talking to me, I was a free,
independent traveller. But at last the things were removed. The two gentlemen
left the room. Suddenly the illusion ceased; reality and business came
back. I, a bondsman just released from the yoke, freed for one week from
twenty-one years of constraint, must, of necessity, resume the fetters
of dependency. Hardly had I tasted the delight of being without a master
when duty issued her stem mandate, 'Go forth and seek another service.'
I never linger over a painful and necessary task, I never take pleasure
before business. It is not in my nature to do so. Impossible to enjoy a
leisurely walk over the city, though I perceived the morning was very fine,
until I had first. presented Mr. Hunsden's letter of introduction, and
got fairly on to the track of a new situation. Wrenching my mind from liberty
and delight I seized my hat and forced my reluctant body out of the Hotel
de -- into the foreign street.</DD>

<DD>
It was a fine day, but I would not look at the blue sky or at the stately
houses round me. My mind was bent on one thing -- finding out 'Mr. Brown,
Numero --, Rue Royale,' for so my letter was addressed. By dint of inquiry
I succeeded. I stood at last at the desired door, knocked, asked for Mr.
Brown, and was admitted.</DD>

<DD>
Being shown into a small breakfast-room, I found myself in the presence
of an elderly gentleman, very grave, businesslike, and respectable-looking.
I presented Mr. Hunsden's letter. He received me very civilly. After a
little desultory conversation he asked me if there was anything in which
his advice or experience could be of use. I said 'Yes,' and then proceeded
to tell him that I was not a gentleman of fortune, travelling for pleasure,
but an ex-counting-house clerk, who wanted employment of some kind, and
that immediately too. He replied that as a friend of Mr. Hunsden's he would
be willing to assist me as well as he could. After some meditation he named
a place in a mercantile house at Liege, and another in a bookseller's shop
at Louvain.</DD>

<DD>
'Clerk and shopman!' murmured I to myself. 'No.' I shook my head. I had
tried the high stool; I hated it. I believed there were other occupations
that would suit me better; besides, I did not wish to leave Brussels.</DD>

<DD>
'I know of no place in Brussels,' answered Mr. Brown, 'unless indeed you
were disposed to turn your attention to teaching. I am acquainted with
the director of a large establishment who is in want of a professor of
English and Latin.'</DD>

<DD>
I thought two minutes; then I seized the idea eagerly.</DD>

<DD>
'The very thing, sir!' said I.</DD>

<DD>
'But,' asked he, 'do you understand French well enough to teach Belgian
boys English?'</DD>

<DD>
Fortunately I could answer this question in the affirmative. Having studied
French under a Frenchman, I could speak the language intelligibly though
not fluently. I could also read it well, and write it decently.</DD>

<DD>
'Then,' pursued Mr. Brown, 'I think I can promise you the place, for Monsieur
Pelet will not refuse a professor recommended by me; but come here again
at five o'clock this afternoon, and I will introduce you to him.'</DD>

<DD>
The word 'professor' struck me. 'I am not a professor,' said I.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh,' returned Mr. Brown, 'professor here in Belgium means a teacher --
that is all.'</DD>

<DD>
My conscience thus quieted, I thanked Mr. Brown, and, for the present,
withdrew. This time I stepped out into the street with a relieved heart;
the task I had imposed on myself for that day was executed. I might now
take some hours of holiday. I felt free to look up. For the first time
I remarked the sparkling clearness of the air, the deep blue of the sky,
the gay, clean aspect of the whitewashed or painted houses; I saw what
a fine street was the Rue Royale, and, walking leisurely along its broad
pavement, I continued to survey its stately hotels, till the palisades,
the gates, the trees of the park appearing in sight offered to my eye a
new attraction. I remember, before entering the park, I stood a while to
contemplate the statue of General Belliard, and then I advanced to the
top of the great staircase just beyond, and I looked down into a narrow
back street, which I afterwards learned was called the Rue d'Isabelle.
I well recollect that my eye rested on the green door of a rather large
house opposite, where, on a brass plate, was inscribed, 'Pensionnat de
Demoiselles.' Pensionnat! The word excited an uneasy sensation in my mind;
it seemed to speak of restraint. Some of the <I>demoiselles</I>, <I>externats</I>
no doubt, were at that moment issuing from the door. I looked for a pretty
face amongst them, but their close little French bonnets hid their features.
In a moment they were gone.</DD>

<DD>
I had traversed a good deal of Brussels before five o'clock arrived, but
punctually as that hour struck I was again in the Rue Royale. Readmitted
to Mr. Brown's breakfast-room, I found him, as before, seated at the table,
and he was not alone -- a gentleman stood by the hearth. Two words of introduction
designated him as my future master. 'M. Pelet, Mr. Crimsworth; Mr. Crimsworth,
M. Pelet.' A bow -- on each side finished the ceremony. I don't know what
sort of a bow I made -- an ordinary one, I suppose, for I was in a tranquil,
commonplace frame of mind; I felt none of the agitation which had troubled
my first interview with Edward Crimsworth. M. Pelet's bow was extremely
polite, yet not theatrical, scarcely French. He and I were presently seated
opposite to each other. In a pleasing voice, low, and, out of consideration
to my foreign ears, very distinct and deliberate, M. Pelet intimated that
he had just been receiving from 'le respectable M. Brown' an account of
my attainments and character which relieved him from all scruple as to
the propriety of engaging me as professor of English and Latin in his establishment.
Nevertheless, for form's sake, he would put a few questions to test my
powers. He did, and expressed in flattering terms his satisfaction at my
answers. The subject of salary next came on. It was fixed at one thousand
francs per annum, besides board and lodging. 'And in addition,' suggested
M. Pelet, 'as there will be some hours in each day during which your services
will not he required in my establishment, you may, in time, obtain employment
in other seminaries, and thus turn your vacant moments to profitable account.'</DD>

<DD>
I thought this very kind, and indeed I found afterwards that the terms
on which M. Pelet had engaged me were really liberal for Brussels, instruction
being extremely cheap there on account of the number of teachers. It was
further arranged that I should be installed in my new post the very next
day, after which M. Pelet and I parted.</DD>

<DD>
Well, and what was he like, and what were my impressions concerning him?
He was a man of about forty years of age, of middle size, and rather emaciated
figure; his face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes hollow; his
features were pleasing and regular. They had a French turn (for M. Pelet
was no Fleming, but a Frenchman both by birth and parentage), yet the degree
of harshness inseparable from Gallic lineaments was in his case softened
by a mild blue eye and a melancholy, almost suffering, expression of countenance;
his physiognomy was <I>fine et spirituelle</I>. I use two French words
because they define better than any English terms the species of intelligence
with which his features were imbued. He was altogether an interesting and
prepossessing personage. I wondered only at the utter absence of all the
ordinary characteristics of his profession, and almost feared he could
not be stern and resolute enough for a schoolmaster. Externally, at least,
M. Pelet presented an absolute contrast to my late master, Edward Crimsworth.</DD>

<DD>
Influenced by the impression I had received of his gentleness, I was a
good deal surprised when, on arriving the next day at my new employer's
house, and being admitted to a first view of what was to be the sphere
of my future labours -- namely, the large, lofty, and well-lighted schoolrooms
-- I beheld a numerous assemblage of pupils, boys of course, whose collective
appearance showed all the signs of a full, flourishing, and well disciplined
seminary. As I traversed the <I>classes</I> in company with M. Pelet a
profound silence reigned on all sides, and if by chance a murmur or a whisper
arose, one glance from the pensive eye of this most gentle pedagogue stilled
it instantly. It was astonishing, I thought, how so mild a check could
prove so effectual. When I had perambulated the length and breadth of the
<I>classes</I>, M. Pelet turned and said to me, --</DD>

<DD>
'Would you object to taking the boys as they are, and testing their proficiency
in English?'</DD>

<DD>
The proposal was unexpected. I had thought I should have been allowed at
least a day to prepare; but it is a bad omen to commence any career by
hesitation, so I just stepped to the professor's desk near which we stood
and faced the circle of my pupils. I took a moment to collect my thoughts,
and likewise to frame in French the sentence by which I proposed to open
business. I made it as short as possible, --</DD>

<DD>
'Messieurs, prenez vos livres de lecture.'</DD>

<DD>
'Anglais ou Fran&ccedil;ais, monsieur?' demanded a thickset, moonfaced
young Flamand in a blouse. The answer was fortunately easy, --</DD>

<DD>
'Anglais.'</DD>

<DD>
I determined to give myself as little trouble as possible in this lesson.
It would not do yet to trust my unpractised tongue with the delivery of
explanations; my accent and idiom would be too open to the criticisms of
the young gentlemen before me, relative to whom I felt already it would
be necessary at once to take up an advantageous position, and I proceeded
to employ means accordingly.</DD>

<DD>
'Commencez!' cried I, when they had all produced their books. Ale moon-faced
youth (by name Jules Vanderkelkov, as I afterwards learned) took the first
sentence. The <I>livre de lecture</I> was 'The Vicar of Wakefield,' much
used in foreign schools, because it is supposed to contain prime samples
of conversational English. It might, however, have been a Runic scroll
for any resemblance the words, as enunciated by Jules, bore to the language
in ordinary use amongst the natives of Great Britain. My God! how he did
snuffle, snort, and wheeze! All he said was said in his throat and nose,
for it is thus the Flamands speak; but I beard him to the end of his paragraph
without proffering a word of correction, whereat he looked vastly self-complacent,
convinced, no doubt, that he had acquitted himself like a real born and
bred 'Anglais.' In the same unmoved silence I listened to a dozen in rotation;
and when the twelfth had concluded with splutter, hiss, and mumble, I solemnly
laid down the book.</DD>

<DD>
'Arr&ecirc;tez!' said I. There was a pause, during which I regarded them
all with a steady and somewhat stern gaze. A dog, if stared at hard enough
and long enough, will show symptoms of embarrassment, and so at length
did my bench of Belgians. Perceiving that some of the faces before me were
beginning to look sullen, and others ashamed, I slowly joined my hands,
and ejaculated in a deep <I>voix de poitrine</I>, --</DD>

<DD>
'Comme c'est affreux!'</DD>

<DD>
They looked at each other, pouted, coloured, swung their heels; they were
not pleased, I saw, but they were impressed, and in the way I wished them
to be. Having thus taken them down a peg in their self-conceit, the next
step was to raise myself in their estimation -- not a very easy thing,
considering that I hardly dared to speak for fear of betraying my own deficiencies.</DD>

<DD>
'Ecoutez, messieurs!' said I, and I endeavoured to throw into my accents
the compassionate tone of a superior being, who, touched by the extremity
of the helplessness which at first only excited his scorn, deigns at length
to bestow aid. I then began at the very beginning of 'The Vicar of Wakefield,'
and read, in a slow, distinct voice, some twenty pages, they all the while
sitting mute and listening with fixed attention. By the time I had done
nearly an hour had elapsed. I then rose and said, --</DD>

<DD>
'C'est assez pour aujourd'hui, messieurs; demain nous recommen&ccedil;erons,
et j'esp&egrave;re que tout ira bien.'</DD>

<DD>
With this oracular sentence I bowed, and in company with M. Pelet quitted
the schoolroom.</DD>

<DD>
'C'est bien! c'est tr&egrave;s bien!' said my principal as we entered his
parlour. 'Je vois que monsieur a de l'adresse; cela me plait, car, dans
l'instruction, l'adresse fait tout autant que le savoir.'</DD>

<DD>
From the parlour M. Pelet conducted me to my apartment -- my <I>chambre</I>,
as monsieur said with a certain air of complacency. It was a very small
room, with an excessively small bed, but M. Pelet gave me to understand
that I was to occupy it quite alone, which was of course a great comfort.
Yet, though so limited in dimensions, it had two windows. Light not being
taxed in Belgium, the people never grudge its admission into their houses.
Just here, however, this observation is not very apropos, for one of these
windows was boarded up. The open window looked into the boys' playground.
I glanced at the other, as wondering what aspect it would present if disencumbered
of the boards. M. Pelet read, I suppose, the expression of my eye; he explained.</DD>

<DD>
'La fen&ecirc;tre ferm&eacute;e donne sur un jardin appartenant &agrave;un
pensionnat de demoiselles,' said he, 'et les convenances exigent -- enfin,
vous comprenez -- n'est-ce pas, monsieur?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oui, oui,' was my reply, and I looked of course quite satisfied; but when
M. Pelet had retired and closed the door after him, the first thing I did
was to scrutinize closely the nailed boards, hoping to find some chink
or crevice which I might enlarge, and so get a peep at the consecrated
ground. My researches were vain, for the boards were well joined and strongly
nailed. It is astonishing how disappointed I felt. I thought it would have
been so pleasant to have looked out upon a garden planted with flowers
and trees, so amusing to have watched the <I>demoiselles</I> at their play,
to have studied female character in a variety of phases, myself the while
sheltered from view by a modest muslin curtain; whereas, owing doubtless
to the absurd scruples of some old duenna of a directness, I had now only
the option of looking at a bare gravelled court, with an enormous <I>pas
de g&eacute;ant</I> in the middle and the monotonous walls and windows
of a boys' schoolhouse round. Not only then, but many a time after, especially
in moments of weariness and low spirits, did I look with dissatisfied eyes
on that most tantalizing board, longing to tear it away and get a glimpse
of the green region which I imagined to he beyond. I knew a tree grew close
up to the window, for though there were as yet no leaves to rustle, I often
heard at night the tapping of branches against the panes. In the daytime,
when I listened attentively, I could hear, even through the boards, the
voices of the <I>demoiselles</I> in their hours of recreation, and, to
speak the honest truth, my sentimental reflections were occasionally a
trifle disarranged by the not quite silvery, in fact the too oft en brazen,
sounds, which, rising from the unseen paradise below, penetrated clamorously
into my solitude. Not to mince matters, it really seemed to me a doubtful
case whether the lungs of Mdlle. Reuter's girls or those of M. Pelet's
boys were the strongest; and when it came to shrieking, the girls indisputably
beat the boys hollow. I forgot to say, by-the-bye, that Reuter was the
name of the old lady who had had my window boarded up. I say old, for such
I, of course, concluded her to be, judging from her cautious, chaperon-like
proceedings; besides, no body ever spoke of her as young. I remember I
was very much amused when I first heard her Christian name; it was Zora&iuml;de
-- Mademoiselle Zora&iuml;de Reuter. But the Continental nations do allow
themselves vagaries in the choice of names such as we sober English never
run into. I think, indeed, we have too limited a list to choose from.</DD>

<DD>
Meantime my path was gradually growing smooth before me. I, in a few weeks,
conquered the teasing difficulties inseparable from the commencement of
almost every career. Ere long I had acquired as much facility in speaking
French as set me at my ease with my pupils; and as I had encountered them
on a right footing at the very beginning, and continued tenaciously to
retain the advantage I had early gained, they never attempted mutiny, which
circumstance all who are in any degree acquainted with the ongoings of
Belgian schools, and who know the relation in which professors and pupils
too frequently stand towards each other in those establishments, will consider
an important and uncommon one. Before concluding this chapter I will say
a word on the system I pursued with regard to my classes. My experience
may possibly be of use to others.</DD>

<DD>
It did not require very keen observation to detect the character of the
youth of Brabant, but it needed a certain degree of tact to adopt one's
measures to their capacity. Their intellectual faculties were generally
weak, their animal propensities strong; thus there was at once an impotence
and a kind of inert force in their natures. They were dull, but they were
also singularly stubborn, heavy as lead, and, like lead, most difficult
to move. Such being the case, it would have been truly absurd to exact
from them much in the way of mental exertion. Having short memories, dense
intelligence, feeble reflective powers, they recoiled with repugnance from
any occupation that demanded close study or deep thought. Had the abhorred
effort been extorted from them by injudicious and arbitrary measures on
the part of the professor, they would have resisted as obstinately, as
clamorously, as desperate swine; and, though not brave singly, they were
relentless acting <I>en masse</I>.</DD>

<DL>I understood that before my arrival in M. Pelet's establishment the
combined insubordination of the pupils had effected the dismissal of more
than one English Master. It was necessary then to exact only the most moderate
application from natures so little qualified to apply; to assist in every
practical way understandings so opaque and contracted; to be ever gentle,
considerate, yielding even, to a certain point, with dispositions so irrationally
perverse. But, having reached that culminating point of indulgence, you
must fix your foot, plant it, root it in rock, become immutable as the
towers of St. Gudule. for a step -- but half a step farther -- and you
would plunge headlong into the gulf of imbecility. There lodged, you would
speedily receive proofs of Flemish gratitude and magnanimity in showers
of Brabant saliva and handfuls of Low Country mud. You might smooth to
the utmost the path of learning, remove every pebble from the track, but
then you must finally insist with decision on the pupil taking your arm
and allowing himself to be led quietly along the prepared road. When I
had brought down my lesson to the lowest level of my dullest pupil's capacity,
when I had shown myself the mildest, the most tolerant of masters, a word
of impertinence, a movement of disobedience, changed me at once into a
despot. I offered them but one alternative -- submission and acknowledgment
of error, or ignominious expulsion. This system answered, and my influence,
by degrees, became established on a firm basis. 'The boy is father to the
man,' it is said; and so I often thought when I looked at my boys and remembered
the political history of their ancestors. Pelet's school was merely an
epitome of the Belgian nation.
