<DD>
No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a mistake in the choice of
his profession, and every man worthy of the name will row long against
wind and tide before he allows himself to cry out, 'I am baffled!' and
submits to be floated passively back to land. From the first week of my
residence in X-- I felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself -- the
work of copying and translating business letters was a dry and tedious
task enough, but had that been all I should long have borne with the nuisance.
I am not of an impatient nature, and, influenced by the double desire of
getting my living and justifying to myself and others the resolution I
had taken to become a tradesman, I should have endured in silence the rust
and cramp of my best faculties. I should not have whispered, even inwardly,
that I longed for liberty. I should have pent in every sigh by which my
heart might have ventured to intimate its distress under the closeness,
smoke, monotony, and joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes. I should have set up the image of Duty, the
fetish of Perseverance, in my small bedroom at Mrs. King's lodgings, and
they two should have been my household gods, from which my darling, my
cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the tender and the mighty, should never,
either by softness or strength, have severed me. But this was not all.
The antipathy which had sprung up between myself and my employer striking
deeper root and spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from every glimpse
of the sunshine of life; and I began to feel like a plant growing in humid
darkness out of the slimy walls of a well.</DD>

<DD>
Antipathy is the only word which can express the feeling Edward Crimsworth
had for me -- a feeling, in a great measure, involuntary, and which was
liable to be excited by every, the most trifling, movement, look, or word
of mine. My southern accent annoyed him; the degree of education evinced
in my language irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and accuracy fixed
his dislike, and gave it the high flavour and poignant relish of envy;
he feared that I too should one day make a successful tradesman. Had I
been in anything inferior to him, he would not have hated me so thoroughly;
but I knew all that he knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he was no sharer. If he
could have once placed me in a ridiculous or mortifying position, he would
have forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three faculties -- caution,
tact, observation; and prowling and prying as was Edward's malignity, it
could never baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels. Day by
day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it would sleep, and prepared to
steal snake-like on its slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.</DD>

<DD>
I had received my first quarter's wages, and was returning to my lodgings,
possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that the master who
had paid me grudged every penny of that hard-earned pittance. (I had long
ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother. He was a hard, grinding
master. He wished to be an inexorable tyrant, that was all.) Thoughts,
not varied but strong, occupied my mind. Two voices spoke within me; again
and again they uttered the same monotonous phrases. One said, 'William,
your life is intolerable.' The other, 'What can you do to alter it?' I
walked fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January. As I approached
my lodgings, I turned from a general view of my affairs to the particular
speculation as to whether my fire would be out. Looking towards the window
of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red gleam.</DD>

<DD>
'That slut of a servant has neglected it as usual,' said I, 'and I shall
see nothing but pale ashes if I go in. It is a fine starlight night; I
will walk a little farther.'</DD>

<DD>
It <I>was</I> a fine night, and the streets were dry and even clean for
X--. There was a crescent curve of moonlight to be seen by the parish church
tower, and hundreds of stars shone keenly bright in all quarters of the
sky.</DD>

<DD>
Unconsciously I steered my course towards the country. I had got into Grove
Street, and began to feel the pleasure of seeing dim trees at the extremity,
round a suburban house when a person leaning over the iron gate of one
of the small gardens which front the neat dwelling-houses in this street
addressed me as I was hurrying with quick stride past.</DD>

<DD>
'What the deuce is the hurry? Just so must Lot have left Sodom, when he
expected fire to pour down upon it out of burning brass clouds.'</DD>

<DD>
I stopped short, and looked towards the speaker. I smelt the fragrance
and saw the red spark of a cigar. The dusk outline of a man, too, bent
towards me over the wicket.</DD>

<DD>
'You see I am meditating in the field at eventide,' continued this shade.
'God knows it's cool work, especially as instead of Rebecca on a camel's
hump, with bracelets on her arms and a ring in her nose, Fate sends me
only a counting-house clerk, in a gray tweed wrapper.'</DD>

<DD>
The voice was familiar to me. Its second utterance enabled me to seize
the speaker's identity.</DD>

<DD>
'Mr. Hunsden! Good-evening.'</DD>

<DD>
'Good-evening, indeed! Yes, but you would have passed me without recognition
if I had not been so civil as to speak first.'</DD>

<DD>
'I did not know you.'</DD>

<DD>
'A famous excuse! You ought to have known me. I knew you, though you were
going ahead like a steam-engine. Are the police after you?'</DD>

<DD>
'It wouldn't be worth their while; I'm not of consequence enough to attract
them.'</DD>

<DD>
'Alas, poor shepherd! Alack and well-a-day! What a theme for regret, and
how down in the mouth you must be judging from the sound of your voice!
But since you're not running from the police, from whom are you running?
The devil?</DD>

<DD>
'On the contrary, I am going post to him.'</DD>

<DD>
'That is well; you're just in luck. This is Tuesday evening. There are
scores of market gigs and carts returning to Dinneford to-night, and he,
or some of his, have a seat in all regularly; so, if you'll step in and
sit half an hour in my bachelor's parlour, you may catch him as he passes
without much trouble. I think, though, you'd better let him alone to-night,
he'll have so many customers to serve. Tuesday is his busy day in X-- and
Dinneford. Come in, at all events.'</DD>

<DD>
He swung the wicket open as he spoke.</DD>

<DD>
'Do you really wish me to go in?' I asked.</DD>

<DD>
'As you please. I'm alone. Your company for an hour or two would be agreeable
to me; but if you don't choose to favour me so far, I'll not press the
point. I hate to bore any one.'</DD>

<DD>
It suited me to accept the invitation as it suited Hunsden to give it.
I passed through the gate, and followed him to the front door, which he
opened; thence we traversed a passage, and entered his parlour. The door
being shut, he pointed me to an arm-chair by the hearth. I sat down and
glanced round me.</DD>

<DD>
It was a comfortable room, at once snug and handsome. The bright grate
was filled with a genuine --shire fire, red, clear, and generous -- no
penurious South-of-England embers heaped in the corner of a grate. On the
table a shaded lamp diffused around a soft, pleasant, and equal light.
The furniture was almost luxurious for a young bachelor, comprising a couch
and two very easy chairs; bookshelves filled the recesses on each side
of the mantelpiece; they were well furnished, and arranged with perfect
order. The neatness of the room suited my taste; I hate irregular and slovenly
habits. From what I saw I concluded that Hunsden's ideas on that point
corresponded with my own. While he removed from the centre table to the
sideboard a few pamphlets and periodicals, I ran my eye along the shelves
of the book-ease nearest me. French and German works predominated -- the
old French dramatists, sundry modern authors, Thiers, Ville-main, Paul
de Kock, George Sand, Eugene Sue; in German -- Goethe, Schiller, Zschokke,
Jean Paul Richter; in English there were works on political economy. I
examined no further, for Mr. Hunsden himself recalled my attention.</DD>

<DD>
'You shall have something,' said he, 'for you ought to feel disposed for
refreshment after walking nobody knows how far on such a Canadian night
as this; but it shall not be brandy-and-water, and it shall not be a bottle
of port, nor ditto of sherry. I keep no such poison. I have Rhein-wein
for my own drinking, and you may choose between that and coffee.</DD>

<DD>
Here again Hunsden suited me. If there was one generally received practice
I abhorred more than another, it was the habitual imbibing of spirits and
strong wines. I had, however, no fancy for his acid German nectar, but
I liked coffee, so I responded, --</DD>

<DD>
'Give me some coffee, Mr. Hunsden.'</DD>

<DD>
I perceived my answer pleased him. He had doubtless expected to see a chilling
effect produced by his steady announcement that he would give me neither
wine nor spirits; he just shot one searching glance at my face to ascertain
whether my cordiality was genuine or a mere feint of politeness. I smiled,
because I quite understood him; and, while I honoured his conscientious
firmness, I was amused at his mistrust. He seemed satisfied, rang the bell,
and ordered coffee, which was presently brought; for himself, a bunch of
grapes and half a pint of something sour sufficed. My coffee was excellent.
I told him so, and expressed the shuddering pity with which his anchorite
fare inspired me. He did not answer and I scarcely think heard my remark.
At that moment one of those momentary eclipses I before alluded to had
come over his face, extinguishing his smile, an id replacing, by an abstracted
and alienated look, the customarily shrewd, bantering glance of his eye.
I employed the interval of silence in a rapid scrutiny of his physiognomy.
I had never observed him closely before, and, as my sight is very short,
I had gathered only a vague, general idea of his appearance. I was surprised
now, on examination, to perceive how small and even feminine were his lineaments.
His tall figure, long and dark locks, his voice and general bearing, had
impressed me with the notion of something powerful and massive. Not at
all. My own features were cast in a harsher and squarer mould than his.
I discerned that there would be contrasts between his inward and outward
man -- contentions too, for I suspected his soul had more of will and ambition
than his body had of fibre and muscle. Perhaps in these incompatibilities
of the 'physique' with the 'morale' lay the secret of that fitful gloom.
he <I>would</I> but <I>could</I> not, and the athletic mind scowled scorn
on its more fragile companion. As to his good looks, I should have liked
to have a woman's opinion on that subject. It seemed to me that his face
might produce the same effect on a lady that a very piquant and interesting
though scarcely pretty female face would on a man. I have mentioned his
dark locks -- they were brushed sideways above a white and sufficiently
expansive forehead; his cheek had a rather hectic freshness; his features
might have done well on canvas but indifferently in marble. They were plastic;
character had set a stamp upon each; expression recast them at her pleasure,
and strange metamorphoses she wrought, giving him now the mien of a morose
bull, and anon that of an arch and mischievous girl; more frequently the
two semblances were blent, and a queer, composite countenance they made.</DD>

<DD>
Starting from his silent fit, he began, --</DD>

<DD>
'William, what a fool you are to live in those dismal lodgings of Mrs.
King's, when you might take rooms here in Grove Street, and have a garden
like me!'</DD>

<DD>
'I should be too far from the mill.'</DD>

<DD>
'What of that? It would do you good to walk there and back two or three
times a day; besides, are you such a fossil that you never wish to see
a flower or a green leaf)'</DD>

<DD>
'I am no fossil.'</DD>

<DD>
'What are you then? You sit at that desk in Crimsworth's counting-house
day by day and week by week, scraping with a pen on paper, just like an
automaton. You never get up; you never say you are tired; you never ask
for a holiday; you never take change or relaxation; you give way to no
excess of an evening; you neither keep wild company nor indulge in strong
drink.'</DD>

<DD>
'Do you, Mr. Hunsden?'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't think to pose me with short questions. Your case and mine are diametrically
different, and it is nonsense attempting to draw a parallel. I say that
when a man endures patiently what ought to be unendurable, he is a fossil.'</DD>

<DD>
'Whence do you acquire a knowledge of my patience?'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, man, do you suppose you are a mystery? The other night you seemed
surprised at my knowing to what family you belonged; now you find subject
for wonderment in my calling you patient. What do you think I do with my
eyes and ears? I've been in your counting-house more than once when Crimsworth
has treated you like a dog -- called for a book, for instance, and when
you gave him the wrong one, or what he chose to consider the wrong one,
flung it back almost in your face; desired you to shut or open the door
as if you had been his flunkey -- to say nothing of your position at the
party about a month ago, where you had neither place nor partner, but hovered
about like a poor, shabby hanger-on. And how patient you were under each
and all of these circumstances'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, Mr. Hunsden, what then?'</DD>

<DD>
'I can hardly tell you what then, The conclusion to be drawn as to your
character depends upon the nature of the motives which guide your conduct.
If you are patient because you expect to make something eventually out
of Crimsworth notwithstanding his tyranny, or perhaps by means of it, you
are what the world calls an interested and mercenary but may be a very
wise fellow; if you are patient because you think it a duty to meet insult
with submission, you are an essential sap and in no shape the man for my
money; if you are patient because your nature is phlegmatic, flat, inexcitable,
and that you cannot get up to the pitch of resistance, why, God made you
to be crushed; and lie down by all means, and he flat, and let Juggernaut
ride well over you.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Hunsden's eloquence was not, it will be perceived, of the smooth and
oily order. As he spoke he pleased me ill. I seem to recognize in him one
of those characters who, sensitive enough themselves, are selfishly relentless
towards the sensitiveness of others. Moreover, though he was neither like
Crimsworth nor Lord Tynedale, yet he was acrid, and, I suspected, overbearing
in his way. There was a tone of despotism in the urgency of the very reproaches
by which he aimed at goading the oppressed into rebellion against the oppressor.
Looking at him still more fixedly than I had yet done, I saw written in
his eye and mien a resolution to arrogate to himself a freedom so unlimited
that it might often trench on the just liberty of his neighbours. I rapidly
ran over these thoughts, and then I laughed a low and involuntary laugh,
moved thereto by a slight inward revelation of the inconsistency of man.
It was as I thought. Hunsden had expected me to take with calm his incorrect
and offensive surmises, his bitter and haughty taunts, and himself was
chafed by a laugh scarce louder than a whisper.</DD>

<DD>
His brow darkened, his thin nostril dilated a little.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, he began, 'I told you that you were an aristocrat, and who but an
aristocrat would laugh such a laugh as that and look such a look -- a laugh
frigidly jeering, a look lazily mutinous, gentlemanlike irony, patrician
resentment? What a nobleman you would have made, William Crimsworth! You
are cut out for one; pity Fortune has balked Nature! Look at the features,
figure, even to the hands; distinction all over -- ugly distinction! Now,
if you'd only an estate, and a mansion, and a park, and a title, how you
could play the exclusive, maintain the rights of your class, train your
tenantry in habits of respect to the peerage, oppose at every step the
advancing power of the people, support your rotten order, and be ready
for its sake to wade knee-deep in churls' blood. As it is, you've no power;
you can do nothing; you're wrecked and stranded on the shores of commerce,
forced into collision with practical men, with whom you cannot cope, for
<I>you'll never be a tradesman</I>.'</DD>

<DD>
The first part of Hunsden's speech moved me not at all, or, if it did,
it was only to wonder at the perversion into which prejudice ,had twisted
his judgment of my character. The concluding sentence, however, not only
moved but shook me; the blow it gave was a severe one, because Truth wielded
the weapon. If I smiled now, it was only in disdain of myself.</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden saw his advantage. he followed it up.</DD>

<DD>
'You'll make nothing by trade,' continued he -- 'nothing more than the
crust of dry bread and the draught of fair water on which you now live;
your only chance of getting a competency lies in marrying a rich widow
or running away with an heiress.'</DD>

<DD>
'I leave such shifts to be put in practice by those who devise them,' said
I, rising.</DD>

<DD>
'And even that is hopeless,' he went on coolly. 'What widow would have
you? Much less, what heiress? You're not bold and venturesome enough for
the one, nor handsome and fascinating enough for the other. You think perhaps
you look intelligent and polished. Carry your intellect and refinement
to market, and tell me in a private note what price is bid for them.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Hunsden had taken his tone for the night; the string he struck was
out of tune; he would finger no other. Averse to discord, of which I had
enough every day and all day long, I concluded, at last, that silence and
solitude were preferable to jarring converse; I bade him good-night.</DD>

<DL>'What! Are you going, lad? Well, good-night. You'll find the door.'
And he sat still in front of the fire, while I left the room and the house.
I had got a good way on my return to my lodgings before I found out that
I was walking very fast, and breathing very hard, and that my nails were
almost stuck into the palms of my clenched hands, and that my teeth were
set fast. On making this discovery I relaxed both my pace, fists, and jaws,
but I could not so soon cause the regrets rushing rapidly through my mind
to slacken their tide. Why did I make myself a tradesman? Why did I enter
Hunsden's house this evening? Why, at dawn to-morrow, must I repair to
Crimsworth's mill? All that night did I ask myself these questions, and
all that night fiercely demanded of my soul an answer. I got no sleep;
my head burned, my feet froze. At last the factory bells rang, and I sprang
from my bed with other slaves.</DL>
