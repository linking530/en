<DD>
The young Anglo-Swiss evidently derived both pleasure and profit from the
study of her mother-tongue. In teaching her I did not, of course, confine
myself to the ordinary school routine. I made instruction in English a
channel for instruction in literature. I prescribed to her a course of
reading. She had a little selection of English classics, a few of which
had been left her by her mother, and the others she had purchased with
her own penny-fee. I lent her some more modern works. All these she read
with avidity, giving me, in writing, a clear summary of each work when
she had perused it. Composition, too, she delighted in. Such occupation
seemed the very breath of her nostrils, and soon her improved productions
wrung from me the avowal that those qualities in her I had termed taste
and fancy ought rather to have been denominated judgment and imagination.
When I intimated so much, which I did as usual in dry and stinted phrase,
I looked for the radiant and exulting smile my one word of eulogy had elicited
before; but Frances coloured. If she did smile, it was very softly and
shyly; and instead of looking up to me with a conquering glance, her eyes
rested on my hand, which, stretched over her shoulder, was writing some
directions with a pencil on the margin of her book.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, are you pleased that I am satisfied with your progress?' I asked.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes,' said she slowly, gently, the blush that had half subsided returning.</DD>

<DD>
'But I do not say enough, I suppose" I continued. 'My praises are too cool.'</DD>

<DD>
She made no answer, and, I thought, looked a little sad. I divined her
thoughts, and should much have liked to have responded to them, had it
been expedient so to do. She was not now very ambitious of my admiration,
not eagerly desirous of dazzling me; a little affection -- ever so little
-- pleased her better than all the panegyrics in the world. Feeling this,
I stood a good while behind her, writing on the margin of her book. I could
hardly quit my station or relinquish my occupation. Something retained
me bending there, my head very near hers, and my hand near hers too; but
the margin of a copy-book is not an illimitable space -- so, doubtless,
the directness thought; and she took occasion to walk past, in order to
ascertain by what art I prolonged so disproportionately the period necessary
for filling it. I was obliged to go. Distasteful effort -- to leave what
we most prefer.</DD>

<DD>
Frances did not become pale or feeble in consequence of her sedentary employment;
perhaps the stimulus it communicated to her mind counterbalanced the inaction
it imposed on her body. She changed, indeed -- changed obviously and rapidly;
but it was for the better. When I first saw her, her countenance was sunless,
her complexion colourless; she looked like one who had no source of enjoyment,
no store of bliss anywhere in the world. Now the cloud had passed from
her mien, leaving space for the dawn of hope and interest, and those feelings
rose like a clear morning, animating what had been depressed, tinting what
had been pale. Her eyes, whose colour I had not at first known, so dim
were they with repressed tears, so shadowed with ceaseless dejection, now,
lit by a ray of the sunshine that cheered her heart, revealed irids of
bright hazel -- irids large and full, screened with long lashes, and pupils
instinct with fire. That look of wan emaciation which anxiety or low spirits
often communicates to a thoughtful, thin face, rather long than round,
having vanished from hers, a clearness of skin almost bloom and a plumpness
almost <I>embonpoint</I> softened the decided lines of her features. Her
figure shared in this beneficial change. It became rounder; and as the
harmony of her form was complete and her stature of the graceful middle
height, one did not regret (or at least I did not regret) the absence of
confirmed fullness in contours still slight, though compact, elegant, flexible.
The exquisite turning of waist, wrist, hand, foot, and ankle satisfied
completely my notions of symmetry, and allowed a lightness and freedom
of movement which corresponded with my ideas of grace.</DD>

<DD>
Thus improved, thus wakened to life, Mdlle. Henri began to take a new footing
in the school. Her mental power manifested gradually but steadily, ere
long extorted recognition even from the envious; and when the young and
healthy saw that she could smile brightly, converse gaily, move with vivacity
and alertness, they acknowledged in her a sisterhood of youth and health,
and tolerated her as of their kind accordingly.</DD>

<DD>
To speak truth, I watched this change much as a gardener watches the growth
of a precious plant, and I contributed to it too, even as the said gardener
contributes to the development of his favourite. To me it was not difficult
to discover how I could best foster my pupil, cherish her starved feelings,
and induce the out- ward manifestation of that inward vigour which sunless
drought and blighting blast had hitherto forbidden to expand. Constancy
of attention, a kindness as mute as watchful, always standing by her, cloaked
in the rough garb of austerity, and making its real nature known only by
a rare glance of interest or a cordial and gentle word; real respect masked
with seeming imperiousness, directing, urging her actions, yet helping
her too, and that with devoted care, -- these were the means I used, for
these means best suited Frances' feelings, as susceptible as deep-vibrating,
her nature at once proud and shy.</DD>

<DD>
The benefits of my system became apparent also in her altered demeanour
as a teacher. She now took her place amongst her pupils with an air of
spirit and firmness which assured them at once that she meant to be obeyed,
and obeyed she was. They felt they had lost their power over her. If any
girl had rebelled, she would no longer have taken her rebellion to heart.
She possessed a source of comfort they could not drain, a pillar of support
they could not overthrow. Formerly, when insulted, she wept; now, she smiled.</DD>

<DD>
The public reading of one of her <I>devoirs</I> achieved the revelation
of her talents to all and sundry. I remember the subject -- it was an emigrant's
letter to his friends at home. It opened with simplicity. Some natural
and graphic touches disclosed to the reader the scene of virgin forest
and great New World river -- barren of sail and flag -- amidst which the
epistle was supposed to be indited. The difficulties and dangers that attend
a settler's life were hinted at; and in the few words said on that subject,
Mdlle. Henri failed not to render audible the voice of resolve, patience,
endeavour. The disasters which had driven him from his native country were
alluded to; stainless honour, inflexible independence, indestructible self-respect
there took the word. Past days were spoken of; the grief of parting, the
regrets of absence, were touched upon. feeling, forcible and fine, breathed
eloquent in every period. At the close, consolation was suggested; religious
faith became there the speaker, and she spoke well.</DD>

<DD>
The <I>devoir</I> was powerfully written in language at once chaste and
choice, in a style nerved with vigour and graced with harmony.</DD>

<DD>
Mdlle. Reuter was quite sufficiently acquainted with English to understand
it when read or spoken in her presence, though she could neither speak
nor write it herself. During the perusal of this <I>devoir</I> she sat
placidly busy, her eyes and fingers occupied with the formation of a rivi&egrave;re,
or open-work hem round a cambric handkerchief. She said nothing, and her
face and forehead, clothed with a mask of purely negative expression, were
as blank of comment as her lips. As neither surprise, pleasure, approbation,
nor interest was evinced in her countenance, so no more were disdain, envy,
annoyance, weariness; if that inscrutable mien said anything, it was simply
this, --</DD>

<DD>
'The matter is too trite to excite an emotion or call forth an opinion.'</DD>

<DD>
As soon as I had done a hum rose. Several of the pupils, pressing round
Mdlle. Henri, began to beset her with compliments. The composed voice of
the directness was now heard, --</DD>

<DD>
'Young ladies, such of you as have cloaks and umbrellas will hasten to
return home before the shower becomes heavier' (it was raining a little);
'the remainder will wait till their respective servants arrive to fetch
them.' And the school dispersed, for it was four o'clock.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur, a word,' said Mdlle. Reuter, stepping on to the estrade, and
signifying, by a movement of the hand, that she wished me to relinquish,
for an instant, the castor I had clutched.</DD>

<DD>
'Mademoiselle, I am at your service.'</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur, it is, of course, an excellent plan to encourage effort in young
people by making conspicuous the progress of any particularly industrious
pupil; but do you not think that, in the present instance, Mdlle. Henri
can hardly be considered as a concurrent with the other pupils? She is
older than most of them, and has had advantages of an exclusive nature
for acquiring a knowledge of English. On the other hand, her sphere of
life is somewhat beneath theirs. Under these circumstances, a public distinction
conferred upon Mdlle. Henri may be the means of suggesting comparisons
and exciting feelings such as would be far from advantageous to the individual
forming their object. The interest I take in Mdlle. Henri's real welfare
makes me desirous of screening her from annoyances of this sort; besides,
monsieur, as I have before hinted to you, the sentiment of <I>amour propre</I>
has a somewhat marked preponderance in her character. Celebrity has a tendency
to foster this sentiment, and in her it should be rather repressed -- she
rather needs keeping down than bringing forward; and then I think, monsieur
-- it appears to me that ambition, <I>literary</I> ambition especially,
is not a feeling to be cherished in the mind of a woman. Would not Mdlle.
Henri be much safer and happier if taught to believe that in the quiet
discharge of social duties consists her real vocation, than if stimulated
to aspire after applause and publicity? She may never marry; scanty as
are her resources, obscure as are her connections, uncertain as is her
health (for I think her consumptive; her mother died of that complaint),
it is more than probable she never will. I do not see how she can rise
to a position whence such a step would be possible; but even in celibacy
it would be better for her to retain the character and habits of a respectable
decorous female.'</DD>

<DD>
'Indisputably, mademoiselle,' was my answer. 'Your opinion admits of no
doubt;' and fearful of the harangue being renewed, I retreated under cover
of that cordial sentence of assent.</DD>

<DD>
At the date of a fortnight after the little incident noted above, I find
it recorded in my diary that a hiatus occurred in Mdlle. Henri's usually
regular attendance in class. The first day or two I wondered at her absence,
but did not like to ask an explanation of it. I thought, indeed, some chance
word might be dropped which would afford me the information I wished to
obtain, without my running the risk of exciting silly smiles and gossiping
whispers by demanding it. But when a week passed and the seat at the desk
near the door still remained vacant, and when no allusion was made to the
circumstance by any individual of the class -- when, on the contrary, I
found that all observed a marked silence on the point -- I determined,
<I>co&ucirc;te qu'il co&ucirc;te</I>, to break the ice of this silly reserve.
I selected Sylvie as my informant, because from her I knew that I should
at least get a sensible answer, unaccompanied by wriggle, titter, or other
flourish of folly.</DD>

<DD>
'O&ugrave; donc est Mdlle. Henri?' I said one day as I returned an exercise-book
I had been examining.</DD>

<DD>
'Elle est partie, monsieur.'</DD>

<DD>
'Partie! et pour combien de temps? Quand reviendra-t-elle?'</DD>

<DD>
'Elle est partie pour toujours, monsieur; elle ne reviendra plus.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah!' was my involuntary exclamation; then after a pause, --</DD>

<DD>
'En &ecirc;tes-vous bien sure, Sylvie?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oui, oui, monsieur, mademoiselle la directrice nous l'a dit elle- m&ecirc;me
il y a deux ou trois jours.'</DD>

<DD>
And I could pursue my inquiries no further; time, place, and circumstances
forbade my adding another word. I could neither comment on what had been
said nor demand further particulars. A question as to the reason of the
teacher's departure, as to whether it had been voluntary or otherwise,
was indeed on my lips, but I suppressed it -- there were listeners all
round. An hour after, in passing Sylvie in the corridor as she was putting
on her bonnet, I stopped short and asked, --</DD>

<DD>
'Sylvie, do you know Mdlle. Henri's address? I have some books of hers,'
I added carelessly, 'and I should wish to send them to her.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, monsieur,' replied Sylvie; 'but perhaps Rosalie, the portress, will
be able to give it you.'</DD>

<DD>
Rosalie's cabinet was just at hand. I stepped in and repeated the inquiry.
Rosalie, a smart French <I>grisette</I>, looked up from her work with a
knowing smile, precisely the sort of smile I had been so desirous to avoid
exciting. Her answer was prepared. She knew nothing whatever of Mdlle.
Henri's address -- had never known it. Turning from her with impatience
-- for I believed she lied and was hired to lie -- I almost knocked down
some one who had been standing at my back. It was the directness. My abrupt
movement made her recoil two or three steps. I was obliged to apologize,
which I did more concisely than politely. No man likes to be dogged, and
in the very irritable mood in which I then was the sight of Mdlle. Reuter
thoroughly incensed me. At the moment I turned her countenance looked hard,
dark, and inquisitive; her eyes were bent upon me with an expression of
almost hungry curiosity. I had scarcely caught this phase of physiognomy
ere it had vanished; a bland smile played on her features; my harsh apology
was received with good-humoured facility.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, don't mention it, monsieur; you only touched my hair with your elbow;
it is no worse, only a little dishevelled.' She shook it back, and passing
her fingers through her curls, loosened them into more numerous and flowing
ringlets. Then she went on with vivacity, --</DD>

<DD>
'Rosalie, I was coming to tell you to go instantly and close the windows
of the <I>salon</I>. The wind is rising, and the muslin curtains will be
covered with dust.'</DD>

<DD>
Rosalie departed. 'Now,' thought I, 'this will not do. Mdlle. Reuter thinks
her meanness in eavesdropping is screened by her art in devising a pretext,
whereas the muslin curtains she speaks of are not more transparent than
this same pretext.' An impulse came over me to thrust the flimsy screen
aside, and confront her craft boldly with a word or two of plain truth.
'The roughshod foot treads most firmly on slippery ground,' thought I;
so I began, --</DD>

<DD>
'Mademoiselle Henri has left your establishment. been dismissed, I presume?'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah, I wished to have a little conversation with you, monsieur,' replied
the directness, with the most natural and affable air in the world. 'but
we cannot talk quietly here. Will monsieur step into the garden a minute?'
And she preceded me, stepping out through the glass door I have before
mentioned.</DD>

<DD>
'There,' said she, when we had reached the centre of the middle alley,
and when the foliage of shrubs and trees, now in their summer pride, closing
behind and around us, shut out the view of the house, and thus imparted
a sense of seclusion even to this little plot of ground in the very core
of a capital -- 'there one feels quiet and free when there are only pear-trees
and rose-bushes about one. I dare say you, like me, monsieur, are sometimes
tired of being eternally in the midst of life, of having human faces always
round you, human eyes always upon you, human voices always in your car.
I am sure I often wish intensely for liberty to spend a whole month in
the country at some little farmhouse, bien gentille, bien propre tout entour&eacute;e
de champs et de bois; quelle vie charmante que la vie champ&ecirc;tre!
N'est-ce pas, monsieur?'</DD>

<DD>
'Cela d&eacute;pend, mademoiselle.'</DD>

<DD>
'Que le vent est bon et frais!' continued the directness; and she was right
there, for it was a south wind, soft and sweet. I carried my hat in my
hand, and this gentle breeze, passing through my hair, soothed my temples
like balm. Its refreshing effect, however, penetrated no deeper than the
mere surface of the frame; for as I walked by the side of Mdlle. Reuter
my heart was still hot within me, and while I was musing the fire burned.
Then spake I with my tongue, --</DD>

<DD>
'I understand Mdlle. Henri is gone from hence, and will not return?'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah, true! I meant to have named the subject to you some days ago, but
my time is so completely taken up I cannot do half the things I wish. Have
you never experienced what it is, monsieur, to find the day too short by
twelve hours for your numerous duties?'</DD>

<DD>
'Not often. Mdlle. Henri's departure was not voluntary, I presume? If it
had been, she would certainly have given me some intimation of it, being
my pupil.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, she did not tell you? That was strange. For my part, I never thought
of adverting to the subject; when one has so many things to attend to,
one is apt to forget little incidents that are not of primary importance.'</DD>

<DD>
'You consider Mdlle. Henri's dismission, then, as a very insignificant
event?'</DD>

<DD>
'Dismission? Ah! she was not dismissed, I can say with truth, monsieur,
that since I became the head of this establishment no master or teacher
has ever been <I>dismissed</I> from it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yet some have left it, mademoiselle?'</DD>

<DD>
'Many. I have found it necessary to change frequently. A change of instructors
is often beneficial to the interests of a school; it gives life and variety
to the proceedings; it amuses the pupils, and suggests to the parents the
idea of exertion and progress.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yet when you are tired of a professor or <I>ma&icirc;tresse</I> you scruple
to dismiss them?'</DD>

<DD>
'No need to have recourse to such extreme measures I assure you. Allons,
monsieur le professeur -- asseyons nous; je vais vous donner une petite
le&ccedil;on dans votre &eacute;tat d'instituteur.' (I wish I might write
all she said to me in French; it loses sadly by being translated into English.)
We had now reached <I>the</I> garden-chair. The directness sat down, and
signed to me to sit by her; but I only rested my knee on the seat, and
stood leaning my head and arm against the embowering branch of a huge laburnum,
whose golden flowers, blent with the dusky green leaves of a lilac-bush,
formed a mixed arch of shade and sunshine over the retreat. Mdlle. Reuter
sat silent a moment; some novel movements were evidently working in her
mind, and they showed their nature on her astute brow. She was meditating
some chef d'&brvbar;uvre of policy. Convinced by several months' experience
that the affectation of virtues she did not possess was unavailing to ensnare
me -- aware that I had read her real nature, and would believe nothing
of the character she gave out as being hers -- she had determined at last
to try a new key, and see if the lock of my heart would yield to that;
a little audacity, a word of truth a glimpse of the real. 'Yes, I will
try,' was her inward resolve; and then her blue eye glittered upon me --
it did not flash, nothing of flame ever kindled in its temperate gleam.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur fears to sit by me?' she inquired playfully.</DD>

<DD>
'I have no wish to usurp Pelet's place,' I answered, for I had got the
habit of speaking to her bluntly -- a habit begun in anger, but continued
because I saw that, instead of offending it fascinated her. She cast down
her eyes and dropped her eyelids. She sighed uneasily; she turned with
an anxious gesture, as if she would give me the idea of a bird that flutters
in its cage, and would fain fly from its jail and jailer, and seek its
natural mate and pleasant nest.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, and your lesson?' I demanded briefly.</DD>

<DD>
'Ah!' she exclaimed, recovering herself, 'you are so young, so frank and
fearless, so talented, so impatient of imbecility, so disdainful of vulgarity,
you need a lesson. Here it is, then. Far more is to be done in this world
by dexterity than by strength; but perhaps you knew that before, for there
is delicacy as well as power in your character, policy as well as pride!'</DD>

<DD>
'Go on,' said I; and I could hardly help smiling, the flattery was so piquant,
so finely seasoned. She caught the prohibited smile, though I passed my
hand over my mouth to conceal it: and again she made room for me to sit
beside her. I shook my head, though temptation penetrated to my senses
at the moment, and once more I told her to go on.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, then, if ever you are at the head of a large establishment, dismiss
nobody. To speak truth, monsieur (and to you I will speak truth), I despise
people who are always making rows, blustering, sending off one to the right,
and another to the left, urging and hurrying circumstances. I'll tell you
what I like best to do, monsieur, shall I?' She looked up again; she had
compounded her glance well this rime -- much archness, mote deference,
a spicy dash of coquetry, an unveiled consciousness of capacity. I nodded.
She treated me like the great Mogul; so I became the great Mogul as far
as she was concerned.</DD>

<DD>
'I like, monsieur, to take my knitting in my hands, and to sit quietly
down in my chair. Circumstances defile past me. I watch their march. So
long as they follow the course I wish, I say nothing and do nothing. I
don't clap my hands, and cry out "Bravo! how lucky I am!" to attract the
attention and envy of my neighbours -- I am merely passive; but when events
fall out ill -- when circumstances become adverse -- I watch very vigilantly.
I knit on still, and still I hold my tongue; but every now and then, monsieur,
I just put my toe out -- so -- and give the rebellious circumstance a little
secret push, without noise which sends it the way I wish, and I am successful
after all, and nobody has seen my expedient. So, when teachers or masters
become troublesome and inefficient -- when, in short, the interests of
the school would suffer from their retaining their places -- I mind my
knitting; events progress, circumstances glide past; I see one which, if
pushed ever so little awry will render untenable the post I wish to have
vacated -- the deed is done -- the stumbling- block removed -- and no one
saw me; I have not made an enemy; I am rid of an encumbrance.'</DD>

<DD>
A moment since, and I thought her alluring; this speech concluded, I looked
on her with distaste. 'Just like you,' was my cold answer. 'And in this
way you have ousted Mdlle. Henri? You wanted her office, therefore you
rendered it intolerable to her?'</DD>

<DD>
'Not at all, monsieur; I was merely anxious about Mdlle. Henri's health.
No; your moral sight is clear and piercing, but there you have failed to
discover the truth. I took -- I have always taken a real interest in Mdlle.
Henri's welfare. I did not like her going out in all weathers; I thought
it would be more advantageous for her to obtain a permanent situation:
besides, I considered her now qualified to do something more than teach
sewing. I reasoned with her; left the decision to herself She saw the correctness
of my views, and adopted them.'</DD>

<DD>
'Excellent! And now, mademoiselle, you will have the goodness to give me
her address.'</DD>

<DD>
'Her address!' and a sombre and stony change came over the mien of the
directness -'her address? Ah! well, I wish I could oblige you, monsieur,
but I cannot, and I will tell you why. Whenever I myself asked her for
her address, she always evaded the inquiry. I thought -- I may be wrong
-- but I <I>thought</I> her motive for doing so was a natural though mistaken
reluctance to introduce me to some probably very poor abode. Her means
were narrow, her origin obscure; she lives somewhere, doubtless, in the
'basse ville."'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll not lose sight of my best pupil yet,' said I, 'though she were born
of beggars and lodged in a cellar; for the rest, it is absurd to make a
bugbear of her origin to me. I happen to know that she was a Swiss pastor's
daughter, neither more nor less; and as to her narrow means, I care nothing
for the poverty of her purse so long as her heart overflows with affluence.'</DD>

<DL>'Your sentiments are perfectly noble, monsieur,' said the directress,
affecting to suppress a yawn; her sprightliness was now extinct, her temporary
candour shut up. The little, red-coloured, piratical-looking pennon of
audacity she had allowed to float a minute in the air was furled, and the
broad, sober-hued flag of dissimulation again hung low over the citadel.
I did not like her thus, so I cut short the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
and departed.</DL>
