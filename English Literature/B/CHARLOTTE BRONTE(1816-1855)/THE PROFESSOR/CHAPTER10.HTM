<DD>
Next day the morning hours seemed to pass very slowly at M. Pelet's. I
wanted the afternoon to come, that I might go again to the neighbouring
<I>pensionnat</I> and give my first lesson within its pleasant precincts,
for pleasant they appeared to me. At noon the hour of recreation arrived;
at one o'clock we had lunch. This got on the time; and at last St. Gudule's
deep bell, tolling slowly two, marked the moment for which I had been waiting.</DD>

<DD>
At the foot of the narrow back stairs that descended from my room I met
M. Pelet.</DD>

<DD>
'Comme vous avez l'air rayonnant!' said he. 'Je ne vous ai jamais vu aussi
gai. Que s'est-il donc pass&eacute;?'</DD>

<DD>
'Apparemment que j'aime les changements,' replied I.</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! je comprends -- c'est cela -- soyez sage seulement. Vous &ecirc;tes
bien jeune -- trop jeune pour le role que vous allez jouer; il faut prendre
garde -- savez-vous?'</DD>

<DD>
'Mais quel danger y a-t-il?'</DD>

<DD>
'Je n'en sais rien -- ne vous laissez pas aller &agrave;de vives impressions
-- viol&agrave;tout.'</DD>

<DD>
I laughed. A sentiment of exquisite pleasure played over my nerves at the
thought that <I>vives impressions</I> were likely to be created. It was
the deadness, the sameness of life's daily ongoings that had hitherto been
my bane. My blouse-clad <I>&eacute;l&egrave;ves</I> in the boys' seminary
never stirred in me any <I>vives impressions</I>, except it might be occasionally
some of anger. I broke from M. Pelet, and as I strode down the passage
he followed me with one of his laughs -- a very French, rakish, mocking
sound.</DD>

<DD>
Again I stood at the neighbouring door, and soon was readmitted into the
cheerful passage with its clear dove-colour imitation marble walls. I followed
the portress, and descending a step, and making a rum, I found myself in
a sort of corridor. A side door opened; Mdlle. Reuter's little figure,
as graceful as it was plump, appeared. I could now see her dress in full
daylight. A neat, simple <I>mousseline-laine</I> gown fitted her compact
round shape to perfection; delicate little collar and <I>manchettes</I>
of lace, trim Parisian <I>brodequins</I> showed her neck, wrists, and feet
to complete advantage; but how grave was her face as she came suddenly
upon me! Solicitude and business were in her eye, on her forehead. She
looked almost stern. Her 'Bonjour, monsieur,' was quite polite, but so
orderly, so commonplace, it spread directly a cool, damp towel over my
<I>vives impressions</I>. The servant turned back when her mistress appeared,
and I walked slowly along the corridor, side by side with Mdlle. Reuter.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur will give a lesson in the first class to-day,' said she; 'dictation
or reading will perhaps be the best thing to begin with, for those are
the easiest forms of communicating instruction in a foreign language; and
at the first a master naturally feels a little unsettled.'</DD>

<DD>
She was quite right, as I had found from experience. It only remained for
me to acquiesce. We proceeded now in silence. The corridor terminated in
a hall, large, lofty, and square. A glass door on one side showed within
a long narrow refectory, with tables, an <I>armoire</I>, and two lamps.
It was empty. Large glass doors in front opened on the playground and garden;
a broad staircase ascended spirally on the opposite side; the remaining
wall showed a pair of great folding doors, now closed, and admitting, doubtless,
to the classes.</DD>

<DD>
Mdlle. Reuter turned her eye laterally on me, to ascertain, probably, whether
I was collected enough to be ushered into her sanctum sanctorum. I suppose
she judged me to be in a tolerable state of self-government, for she opened
the door, and I followed her through. A rustling sound of uprising greeted
our entrance. Without looking to the right or left, I walked straight up
the lane between two sets of benches and desks, and took possession of
the empty chair and isolated desk raised on an estrade, of one step high,
so as to command one division, the other division being under the surveillance
of a <I>ma&icirc;tresse</I> similarly elevated. At the back of the estrade,
and attached to a movable partition dividing this schoolroom from another
beyond, was a large <I>tableau</I> of wood painted black and varnished;
a thick crayon of white chalk lay on my desk, for the convenience of elucidating
any grammatical or verbal obscurity which might occur in my lessons, by
writing it upon the <I>tableau</I>; a wet sponge appeared beside the chalk,
to enable me to efface the marks when they had served the purpose intended.</DD>

<DD>
I carefully and deliberately made these observations before allowing myself
to take one glance at the benches before me. Having handled the crayon,
looked back at the <I>tableau</I>, fingered the sponge, in order to ascertain
that it was in a right state of moisture, I found myself cool enough to
admit of looking calmly up and gazing deliberately round me.</DD>

<DD>
And first I observed that Mdlle. Reuter had already glided away; she was
nowhere visible. A <I>ma&icirc;tresse</I>, or teacher -- the one who occupied
the corresponding estrade to my own -- alone remained to keep guard over
me. She was a little in the shade, and with my short sight I could only
see that she was of a thin bony figure and rather tallowy complexion, and
that her attitude, as she sat, partook equally of listlessness and affectation.
More obvious, more prominent, shone on by the full light of the large window,
were the occupants of the benches just before me, of whom some were girls
of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, some young women from eighteen (as it appeared
to me) up to twenty. The most modest attire, the simplest fashion of wearing
the hair, were apparent in all; and good features, ruddy, blooming complexions,
large and brilliant eyes, forms full, even to solidity, seemed to abound.
I did not bear the first view like a stoic. I was dazzled, my eyes fell,
and in a voice somewhat too low I murmured, --</DD>

<DD>
'Prenez vos cahiers de dict&eacute;e, mesdemoiselles.'</DD>

<DD>
Not so had I bid the boys at Pelet's take their reading-hooks. A rustle
followed, and an opening of desks; behind the lifted lids which momentarily
screened the heads bent down to search for exercise-books, I heard tittering
and whispers.</DD>

<DD>
'Eulalie, je suis pr&ecirc;te &agrave;p&acirc;mer de rire,' observed one.</DD>

<DD>
'Comme il a rougi en parlant!'</DD>

<DD>
'Oui, c'est un veritable blanc-bec.'</DD>

<DD>
'Tais-toi, Hortense; il nous &eacute;coute.'</DD>

<DD>
And now the lids sank and the heads reappeared. I had marked three, the
whisperers, and I did not scruple to take a very steady look at them as
they emerged from their temporary eclipse. It is astonishing what case
and courage their little phrases of flippancy had given me. The idea by
which I had been awed was that the youthful beings before me, with their
dark nun-like robes and softly-braided hair, were a kind of half-angels.
The light titter, the giddy whisper, had already in some measure relieved
my mind of that fond and oppressive fancy.</DD>

<DD>
The three I allude to were just in front, within half a yard of my estrade,
and were among the most womanly-looking present. Their names I knew afterwards,
and may as well mention now; they were Eulalie, Hortense, Caroline. Eulalie
was tall, and very finely shaped. She was fair, and her features were those
of a Low Country Madonna. Many a <I>figure de Vierge</I> have I seen in
Dutch pictures exactly resembling hers. There were no angles in her shape
or in her face -- all was curve and roundness; neither thought, sentiment,
nor passion disturbed by line or flush the equality of her pale, clear
skin. Her noble bust heaved with her regular breathing, her eyes moved
a little. By these evidences of life alone could I have distinguished her
from some large handsome figure moulded in wax. Hortense was of middle
size, and stout. Her form was ungraceful, her face striking, more alive
and brilliant than Eulalie's; her hair was dark brown, her complexion richly
coloured. there were frolic and mischief in her eye. Consistency and good
sense she might possess, but none of her features betokened those qualities.</DD>

<DD>
Caroline was little, though evidently full-grown. Raven-black hair, very
dark eyes, absolutely regular features, with a colourless olive complexion,
clear as to the face and sallow about the neck, formed in her that assemblage
of points whose union many persons regard as the perfection of beauty.
How, with the tintless pallor of her skin and the classic straightness
of her lineaments, she managed to look sensual, I don't know. I think her
lips and eyes contrived the affair between them, and the result left no
uncertainty on the beholder's mind. She was sensual now, and in ten years'
time she would be coarse, promise plain was written in her face of much
future folly.</DD>

<DD>
If I looked at these girls with little scruple, they looked at me with
still less. Eulalie raised her unmoved eye to mine, and seemed to expect,
passively but securely, an impromptu tribute to her majestic charms. Hortense
regarded me boldly, and giggled at the same time, while she said, with
an air of impudent freedom, --</DD>

<DD>
'Dictez-nous quelque chose de facile pour commencer, monsieur.'</DD>

<DD>
Caroline shook her loose ringlets of abundant but somewhat coarse hair
over her rolling black eyes. parting her lips, as full as those of a hot-blooded
Maroon, she showed her- well-set teeth sparkling between them, and treated
me at the same time to a smile <I>de sa fa&ccedil;on</I>. Beautiful as
Pauline Borghese, she looked at the moment scarcely purer than Lucr&egrave;ce
de Borgia. Caroline was of noble family. I heard her lady-mother's character
afterwards, and then I ceased to wonder at the precocious accomplishments
of the daughter. These three, I at once saw, deemed themselves the queens
of the school, and conceived that by their splendour they threw all the
rest into the shade. In less than five minutes they had thus revealed to
me their characters, and in less than five minutes I had buckled on a breast-plate
of steely indifference, and let down a visor of impassable austerity.</DD>

<DD>
'Take your pens and commence writing,' said I, in as dry and trite a voice
as if I had been addressing only Jules Vanderkelkov and Co.</DD>

<DD>
The <I>dict&eacute;e</I> now commenced. My three belles interrupted me
perpetually with little silly questions and uncalled-for remarks, to some
of which I made no answer, and to others replied very quietly and briefly.</DD>

<DD>
'Comment dit-on point et virgule en anglais, monsieur?'</DD>

<DD>
'Semi-colon, mademoiselle.'</DD>

<DD>
'Semi-collong? Ah, comme c'est dr&ocirc;le!' (Giggle.)</DD>

<DD>
'J'ai une si mauvaise plume -- impossible d'&eacute;crire!'</DD>

<DD>
'Mais, monsieur -- je ne sais pas suivre -- vous allez si vite.'</DD>

<DD>
'Je n'ai rien compris, moi!'</DD>

<DD>
Here a general murmur arose, and the teacher, opening her lips for the
first time, ejaculated, --</DD>

<DD>
'Silence, mesdemoiselles!'</DD>

<DD>
No silence followed; on the contrary, the three ladies in front began to
talk more loudly.</DD>

<DD>
'C'est si difficile, l'anglais!'</DD>

<DD>
'Je d&eacute;teste la dict&eacute;e.'</DD>

<DD>
'Quel ennui d'&eacute;crire quelque chose quc l'on ne comprend pas!'</DD>

<DD>
Some of those behind laughed. A degree of confusion began to pervade the
class. It was necessary to take prompt measures.</DD>

<DD>
'Donnez-moi votre cahier,' said I to Eulalie in an abrupt tone; and bending
over, I took it before she had time to give it.</DD>

<DD>
'Et vous, mademoiselle; donnez-moi le votre,' continued I, more mildly,
addressing a little pale, plain-looking girl, who sat in the first row
of the other division, and whom I had remarked as being at once the ugliest
and the most attentive in the room. She rose up, walked over to me, and
delivered her book with a grave, modest curtsy. I glanced over the two
dictations. Eulalie's was slurred, blotted, and full of silly mistakes;
Sylvie's (such was the name of the ugly little girl) was clearly written,
it contained no error against sense, and but few faults of orthography.
I coolly read aloud both exercises, marking the faults; then I looked at
Eulalie.</DD>

<DD>
'C'est honteux!' said I, and I deliberately tore her dictation in four
parts, and presented her with the fragments I returned Sylvie her book
with a smile, saying, --</DD>

<DD>
'C'est bien; je suis content de vous.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvie looked calmly pleased. Eulalie swelled like an incensed turkey.
But the mutiny was quelled. The conceited coquetry and futile flirtation
of the first bench were exchanged for a taciturn sullenness, much more
convenient to me, and the rest of my lesson passed without interruption.</DD>

<DD>
A bell clanging out in the yard announced the moment for the cessation
of school labours. I heard our own bell at the same time, and that of a
certain public college immediately after. Order dissolved instantly. Up
started every pupil. I hastened to seize my hat, bow to the <I>ma&icirc;tresse</I>,
and quit the room before the tide of <I>externats</I> should pour from
the inner class, where I knew near a hundred were prisoned, and whose rising
tumult I already heard.</DD>

<DD>
I bad scarcely crossed the hall and gained the corridor when Mdlle. Reuter
came again upon me.</DD>

<DD>
'Step in here a moment,' said she, and she held open the door of the side
room from whence she had issued on my arrival. It was a <I>salle-&agrave;-manger</I>,
as appeared from the <I>beaufet</I>, and the <I>armoire vitr&eacute;e</I>,
filled with glass and china, which formed part of its furniture. Ere she
had closed the door on me and herself, the corridor was already filled
with day-pupils, tearing down their cloaks, bonnets, and <I>cabas</I> from
the wooden pegs on which they were suspended. The shrill voice of a <I>ma&icirc;tresse</I>
was heard at intervals, vainly endeavouring to enforce some sort of order
-- vainly, I say. Discipline there was none in these rough ranks, and yet
this was considered one of the best conducted schools in Brussels.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, you have given your first lesson,' began Mdlle. Reuter in the most
calm, equable voice, as though quite unconscious of the chaos from which
we were separated only by a single wall.</DD>

<DD>
'Were you satisfied with your pupils, or did any circumstance in their
conduct give you cause for complaint? Conceal nothing from me; repose in
me entire confidence.'</DD>

<DD>
Happily, I felt in myself complete power to manage my pupils without aid.
The enchantment, the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity at first,
had been a good deal dissipated. I cannot say I was chagrined or downcast
by the contrast which the reality of a <I>pensionnat de demoiselles</I>
presented to my vague ideal of the same community. I was only enlightened
and amused; consequently, I felt in no disposition to complain to Mdlle.
Reuter, and I received her considerate invitation to confidence with a
smile.</DD>

<DD>
'A thousand thanks, mademoiselle; all has gone very smoothly.'</DD>

<DD>
She looked more than doubtful.</DD>

<DD>
'Et les trois demoiselles du premier bane?' said she.</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! tout va an mieux!' was my answer, and Mdlle. Reuter ceased to question
me; but her eye -- not large, not brilliant, not melting, or kindling,
but astute, penetrating, practical -- showed she was even with me. It let
out a momentary gleam, which said plainly, 'Be as close as you like; I
am not dependent on your candour. What you would conceal I already know.'</DD>

<DD>
By a transition so quiet as to be scarcely perceptible, the directress's
manner changed. The anxious business air passed from her face, and she
began chatting about the weather and the town, and asking in neighbourly
wise after M. and Madame Pelet. I answered all her little questions. She
prolonged her talk; I went on following its many little windings. She sat
so long, said so much, varied so often the topics of discourse, that it
was not difficult to perceive she had a particular aim in thus detaining
me. Her mere words could have afforded no clue to this aim, but her countenance
aided, while her lips uttered only affable commonplaces, her eyes reverted
continually to my face. Her glances were not given in full, but out of
the corners, so quietly, so stealthily, yet I think I lost not one. I watched
her as keenly as she watched me. I perceived soon that she was feeling
after my real character. She was searching for salient points, and weak
points, and eccentric points. She was applying now this test, now that,
hoping in the end to find some chink, some niche where she could put in
her little firm foot and stand upon my neck, mistress of my nature. Do
not mistake me, reader -- it was no amorous influence she wished to gain;
at that time it was only the power of the politician to which she aspired.
I was now installed as a professor in her establishment, and she wanted
to know where her mind was superior to mine, by what feeling or opinion
she could lead me.</DD>

<DD>
I enjoyed the game much, and did not hasten its conclusion. Sometimes I
gave her hopes, beginning a sentence rather weakly, when her shrewd eye
would light up; she thought she had me. Having led her a little way, I
delighted to turn round and finish with sound, hard sense, whereat her
countenance would fall. At last a servant entered to announce dinner. The
conflict being thus necessarily terminated, we parted without having gained
any advantage on either side. Mdlle. Reuter had not even given me an opportunity
of attacking her with feeling, and I had managed to baffle her little schemes
of craft. It was a regular drawn battle. I again held out my hand when
I left the room; she gave me hers. It was a small and white hand, but how
cool! I met her eye, too, in full, obliging her to give me a straightforward
look. This last test went against me. It left her as it found her -- moderate,
temperate, tranquil; me it disappointed.</DD>

<DL>'I am growing wiser,' thought I, as I walked back to M. Pelet's. 'Look
at this little woman. Is she like the women of novelists and romancers?
To read of female character as depicted in poetry and fiction, one would
think it was made up of sentiment, either for good or bad. Here is a specimen
and a most sensible and respectable specimen too, whose staple ingredient
is abstract reason. No Talleyrand was ever more passionless than Zora&iuml;de
Reuter.' So I thought then. I found afterwards that blunt susceptibilities
are very consistent with strong propensities.
