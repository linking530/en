<DD>
One fine, frosty Sunday in November Frances and I took a long walk. We
made the tour of the city by the boulevards, and afterwards, Frances being
a little tired, we sat down on one of those wayside seats placed under
the trees at intervals for the accommodation of the weary, Frances was
telling me about Switzerland. The subject animated her; and I was just
thinking that her eyes spoke fall as eloquently as her tongue, when she
stopped and remarked, --</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur, there is a gentleman who knows you.'</DD>

<DD>
I looked up. Three fashionably dressed men were just then passing -- Englishmen,
I knew, by their air and gait as well as by their features. In the tallest
of the trio I at once recognized Mr. Hunsden; he was in the act of lifting
his hat to Frances. Afterwards he made a grimace at me, and passed on.</DD>

<DD>
'Who is he?'</DD>

<DD>
'A person I knew in England.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why did he bow to me? he does not know me.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, he does know you, in his way.'</DD>

<DD>
'How, monsieur?' (She still called me 'monsieur;' I could not persuade
her to adopt any more familiar term.)</DD>

<DD>
'Did you not read the expression of his eyes?'</DD>

<DD>
'Of his eyes? No; what did they say?'</DD>

<DD>
'To you they said, "How do you do, Wilhelmina Crimsworth?" To me, "So you
have found your counterpart at last; there she sits, the female of your
kind!"'</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur, you could not read all that in his eyes; he was so soon gone.'</DD>

<DD>
'I read that and more, Frances. I read that he will probably call on me
this evening, or on some future occasion shortly. and I have no doubt he
will insist on being introduced to you. Shall I bring him to your rooms?'</DD>

<DD>
'If you please, monsieur; I have no objection. I think, indeed, I should
rather like to see him nearer; he looks so original.'</DD>

<DD>
As I had anticipated, Mr. Hunsden came that evening. The first thing he
said was, --</DD>

<DD>
'You need not begin boasting, monsieur le professeur. I know about your
appointment to College, and all that; Brown has told me.' Then he intimated
that he had returned from Germany hut a day or two since; afterwards he
abruptly demanded whether that was Madame Pelet-Reuter with whom he had
seen me on the boulevards. I was going to utter a rather emphatic negative,
but on second thoughts I checked myself, and, seeming to assent, asked
what he thought of her.</DD>

<DD>
'As to her, I'll come to that directly; but first I've a word for you.
I see you are a scoundrel. You've no business to be promenading about with
another man's wife. I thought you had sounder sense than to get mixed up
in foreign hodgepodge of this sort.'</DD>

<DD>
'But the lady?'</DD>

<DD>
'She's too good for you evidently. She is like you, but something better
than you; no beauty, though. Yet when she rose (for I looked back to see
you both walk away) I thought her figure and carriage good. These foreigners
understand grace. What the devil has she done with Pelet? She has not been
married to him three months; he must be a spoon!'</DD>

<DD>
I would not let the mistake go too far. I did not like it much.</DD>

<DD>
'Pelet? How your head runs on M. and Madame Pelet! You are always talking
about them. I wish to the gods you had wed Mdlle. Zora&iuml;de yourself"</DD>

<DD>
'Was that young gentlewoman not Mdlle. Zora&iuml;de?'</DD>

<DD>
'No, nor Madame Zora&iuml;de either.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why did you tell a lie then?'</DD>

<DD>
'I told no lie; but you are in such a hurry. She is a pupil of mine --
a Swiss girl.'</DD>

<DD>
'And, of course, you are going to be married to her? Don't deny that.'</DD>

<DD>
'Married! I think I shall -- if Fate spares us both ten weeks longer. That
is my little wild strawberry, Hunsden, whose sweetness made me careless
of your hot-house grapes.'</DD>

<DD>
'Stop! No boasting, no heroics; I won't hear them. What is she? To what
<I>caste</I> does she belong?'</DD>

<DD>
I smiled. Hunsden unconsciously laid stress on the word <I>caste</I>, and,
in fact, republican, lord-hater as he was, Hunsden was as proud of his
old --shire blood, of his descent and family standing, respectable and
respected through long generations back, as any peer in the realm of his
Norman race and Conquest-dated title. Hunsden would as little have thought
of taking a wife from a <I>caste</I> inferior to his own as a Stanley would
think of mating with a Cobden. I enjoyed the surprise I should give; I
enjoyed the triumph of my practice over his theory; and leaning over the
table, and uttering the words slowly but with repressed glee, I said concisely,
--</DD>

<DD>
'She is a lace-mender.'</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden examined me. He did not <I>say</I> he was surprised, but surprised
he was. He had his own notions of good breeding. I saw he suspected I was
going to take some very rash step; but repressing declamation or remonstrance,
he only answered, --</DD>

<DD>
'Well, you are the best judge of your own affairs. A lace-mender may make
a good wife as well as a lady; but, of course, you have taken care to ascertain
thoroughly that since she has not education, fortune, or station, she is
well furnished with such natural qualities as you think most likely to
conduce to your happiness. Has she many relations' '</DD>

<DD>
'None in Brussels.'</DD>

<DD>
'That is better. Relations are often the real evil in such cases. I cannot
but think that a train of inferior connections would have been a bore to
you to your life's end.'</DD>

<DD>
After sitting in silence a little while longer, Hunsden rose, and was quietly
bidding me good-evening. The polite, considerate manner in which he offered
me his hand (a thing he had never done before) convinced me that he thought
I had made a terrible fool of myself; and that, ruined and thrown away
as I was, it was no time for sarcasm or cynicism, or indeed for anything
hut indulgence and forbearance.</DD>

<DD>
'Good-night, William,' he said, in a really soft voice, while his face
looked benevolently compassionate; 'goodnight, lad. I wish you and your
future wife much prosperity, and I hope she will satisfy your fastidious
soul.'</DD>

<DD>
I had much ado to refrain from laughing as I beheld the magnanimous pity
of his mien. Maintaining, however, a grave air, I said, 'I 'thought you
would have liked to have seen Mdlle. Henri?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, that is the name! Yes, if it would be convenient, I should like to
see her; but --'He hesitated.</DD>

<DD>
'Well?'</DD>

<DD>
'I should on no account wish to intrude.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come, then,' said I. We set out. Hunsden no doubt regarded me as a rash,
imprudent man, thus to show my poor little <I>grisette</I> sweet-heart,
in her poor little unfurnished <I>grenier</I>; but he prepared to act the
real gentleman, having, in fact, the kernel of that character under the
harsh husk it pleased him to wear by way of mental mackintosh. He talked
affably, and even gently, as we went along the street. He had never been
so civil to me in his life. We reached the house, entered, ascended the
stair; on gaining the lobby, Hunsden turned to mount a narrower stair which
led to a higher story. I saw his mind was bent on the attics.</DD>

<DD>
'Here, Mr. Hunsden,' said I quietly, tapping at Frances' door. He turned.
In his genuine politeness he was a little disconcerted at having made the
mistake. His eye reverted to the green mat, but he said nothing.</DD>

<DD>
We walked in, and Frances rose from her seat near the table to receive
us. Her mourning attire gave her a recluse, rather conventual, but withal
very distinguished look. Its grave simplicity added nothing to beauty,
but much to dignity. The finish of the white collar and <I>manchettes</I>
sufficed for a relief to the merino gown of solemn black; ornament was
forsworn. Frances curtsied with sedate grace, looking, as she always did
look, when one first accosted her, more a woman to respect than to love.
I introduced Mr. Hunsden, and she expressed her happiness at making his
acquaintance in French. The pure and polished accent, the low yet sweet
and rather full voice, produced their effect immediately. Hunsden spoke
French in reply. I had not heard him speak that language before; he managed
it very well. I retired to the window seat. Mr. Hunsden, at his hostess's
invitation, occupied a chair near the hearth; from my position I could
see them both, and the room too, at a glance. The room was so clean and
bright it looked like a little polished cabinet; a glass filled with flowers
in the centre of the table, a fresh rose in each china cup on the mantelpiece,
gave it an air of <I>f&ecirc;te</I>. Frances was serious and Mr. Hunsden
subdued, but both mutually polite; they got on at the French swimmingly.
Ordinary topics were discussed with great state and decorum. I thought
I had never seen two such models of propriety; for Hunsden (thanks to the
constraint of the foreign tongue) was obliged to shape his phrases, and
measure his sentences, with a care that forbade any eccentricity. At last
England was mentioned, and Frances proceeded to ask questions. Animated
by degrees she began to change, just as a grave night-sky changes at the
approach of sunrise. First it seemed as if her forehead cleared, then her
eyes glittered, her features relaxed, and became quite mobile. Her subdued
complexion grew warm and transparent. To me she now looked pretty; before,
she had only looked ladylike.</DD>

<DD>
She had many things to say to the Englishman just fresh from his island
country, and she urged him with an enthusiasm of curiosity which ere long
thawed Hunsden's reserve as fire thaws a congealed viper. I use this not
very flattering comparison because he vividly reminded me of a snake waking
from torpor, as he erected his tall form, reared his head, before a little
declined, and putting back his hair from his broad Saxon forehead, showed
unshaded the gleam of almost savage satire which his interlocutor's tone
of eagerness and look of ardour had sufficed at once to kindle in his soul
and elicit from his eyes. He was himself as Frances was herself, and in
none but his own language would he now address her.</DD>

<DD>
'You understand English?' was the prefatory question.</DD>

<DD>
'A little.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, then, you shall have plenty of it. And first, I see you've not much
more sense than some others of my acquaintance' (indicating me with his
thumb), or else you'd never turn rabid about that dirty little country
called England -- for rabid I see you are. I read Anglo- phobia in your
looks, and hear it in your words. Why, mademoiselle, is it possible that
anybody with a grain of rationality should feel enthusiasm about a mere
name, and that name England? I thought you were a lady-abbess five minutes
ago, and respected you accordingly; and now I see you are a sort of Swiss
sibyl, with high Tory and high Church principles!'</DD>

<DD>
'England is your country?' asked Frances.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes.'</DD>

<DD>
'And you don't like it?'</DD>

<DD>
'I'd be sorry to like it! A little, corrupt, venal, lord-and-king- cursed
nation, full of mucky pride -- as they say in --shire -- and help- less
pauperism; rotten with abuses, worm-eaten with prejudices!'</DD>

<DD>
'You might say so of almost every state. There are abuses and prejudices
everywhere, and I thought fewer in England than in other countries.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come to England and see. Come to Birmingham and Manchester, come to St.
Giles's in London, and get a practical notion of how our system works.
Examine the footprints of our august aristocracy; see how they walk in
blood, crushing hearts as they go. Just put your head in at English cottage
doors; get a glimpse of Famine crouched torpid on black hearthstones, of
Disease lying bare on beds without coverlets, of Infamy wantoning viciously
with Ignorance, though indeed Luxury is her favourite paramour, and princely
halls are dearer to her than thatched hovels</DD>

<DD>
'I was not thinking of the wretchedness and vice in England; I was thinking
of the good side -- of what is elevated in your character as a nation.'</DD>

<DD>
'There is no good side -- none, at least, of which you can have any knowledge;
for you cannot appreciate the efforts of industry, the achievements of
enterprise, or the discoveries of science. Narrowness of education and
obscurity of position quite incapacitate you from understanding those points;
and as to historical and poetical associations, I will not insult you mademoiselle,
by supposing that you alluded to such humbug.'</DD>

<DD>
'But I did partly.'</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden laughed -- his laugh of unmitigated scorn.</DD>

<DD>
'I did, Mr. Hunsden. Are you of the number of those to whom such associations
give no pleasure?'</DD>

<DD>
'Mademoiselle, what is an association? I never saw one. What is its length,
breadth, weight, value -- ay, <I>value</I>? What price will it bring in
the market?'</DD>

<DD>
'Your portrait, to any one who loved you, would, for the sake of association,
be without price.'</DD>

<DD>
That inscrutable Hunsden heard this remark, and felt it rather acutely,
too, somewhere, for he coloured -- a thing not unusual with him when hit
unawares on a tender point. A sort of trouble momentarily darkened his
eye, and I believe he filled up the transient pause succeeding his antagonist's
home-thrust by a wish that some one did love him as he would like to be
loved -- some one whose love he could unreservedly return.</DD>

<DD>
The lady pursued her temporary advantage.</DD>

<DD>
'If your world is a world without associations, Mr. Hunsden, I no longer
wonder that you hate England so. I don't dearly know what Paradise is,
and what angels are, yet taking it to he the most glorious region I can
conceive, and angels the most elevated existences, if one of them -- if
Abdiel the faithful himself' (she was thinking of Milton) -- 'were suddenly
stripped of the faculty of association, I think he would soon rush forth
from "the ever-during gates," leave heaven, and seek what he had lost in
hell -- yes, in the very hell from which he turned "with retorted scorn."'</DD>

<DD>
Frances' tone in saying this was as marked as her language, and it was
when the word 'hell' twanged off from her lips, with a somewhat startling
emphasis, that Hunsden deigned to bestow one slight glance of admiration.
He liked something strong, whether in man or woman; he liked whatever dared
to clear conventional limits. He had never before heard a lady say 'hell'
with that uncompromising sort of accent, and the sound pleased him from
a lady's lips; he would fain have had Frances to strike the string again,
but it was not in her way. The display of eccentric vigour never gave her
pleasure, and it only sounded in her voice or flashed in her countenance
when extraordinary circumstances -- and those generally painful -- forced
it out of the depths where it burned latent. To me, once or twice, she
had, in intimate conversation, uttered venturous thoughts in nervous language;
but when the hour of such manifestation was past, I could not recall it
-- it came of itself, and of itself departed. Hunsden's excitations she
put by soon with a smile, and recurring to the theme of disputation, said,
--</DD>

<DD>
'Since England is nothing, why do the Continental nations respect her so?'</DD>

<DD>
'I should have thought no child would have asked that question,' replied
Hunsden, who never at any time gave information without reproving for stupidity
those who asked it of him. 'If you had been my pupil, as I suppose you
once had the misfortune to be that of a deplorable character not a hundred
miles off, I would have put you in the corner for such a confession of
ignorance. Why, mademoiselle, can't you see that it is our <I>gold</I>
which buys us French politeness, German good will, and Swiss servility?'
and he sneered diabolically.</DD>

<DD>
'Swiss!' said Frances, catching the word 'servility.' 'Do you call my countrymen
servile?' And she started up. I could not suppress a low laugh: there was
ire in her glance and defiance in her attitude. 'Do you abuse Switzerland
to me, Mr. Hunsden? Do you think I have no associations? Do you calculate
that I am prepared to dwell only on what vice and degradation may he found
in Alpine villages, and to leave quite out of my heart the social greatness
of my countrymen, and our blood-earned freedom, and the natural glories
of our mountains? You're mistaken -- you're mistaken.'</DD>

<DD>
'Social greatness? Call it what you will, your countrymen are sensible
fellows. They make a marketable article of what to you is an abstract idea;
they have ere this sold their social greatness and also their blood-eared
freedom to be the servants of foreign kings.'</DD>

<DD>
'You never were in Switzerland?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; I have been there twice.'</DD>

<DD>
'You know nothing of it.'</DD>

<DD>
'I do.'</DD>

<DD>
'And you say the Swiss are mercenary, as a parrot says "Poor Poll," or
as the Belgians here say the English are not brave, or as the French accuse
them of being perfidious. There is no justice in your dictums.'</DD>

<DD>
'There is truth.'</DD>

<DD>
'I tell you, Mr. Hunsden, you are a more unpractical man than I am an unpractical
woman, for you don't acknowledge what really exists. You want to annihilate
individual patriotism and national greatness as an atheist would annihilate
God and his own soul, by denying their existence.'</DD>

<DD>
'Where are you flying to? You are of at a tangent. I thought we were talking
about the mercenary nature of the Swiss.'</DD>

<DD>
'We were; and if you proved to me that the Swiss are mercenary to-morrow
(which you cannot do), I should love Switzerland still.'</DD>

<DD>
'You would be mad, then -- mad as a March hare -- to indulge in a passion
for trillions of shiploads of soil, timber, snow, and ice.'</DD>

<DD>
'Not so mad as you who love nothing.'</DD>

<DD>
'There's a method in my madness; there's none in yours.'</DD>

<DD>
'Your method is to squeeze the sap out of creation and make manure of the
refuse, by way of turning it to what you call use.'</DD>

<DD>
'You cannot reason at all,' said Hunsden; 'there is no logic in you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Better to be without logic than without feeling,' retorted Frances, who
was now passing backwards and forwards from her cupboard to the table,
intent, if not on hospitable thoughts, at least on hospitable deeds, for
she was laying the cloth, and putting plates, knives, and forks thereon.</DD>

<DD>
'Is that a hit at me, mademoiselle? Do you suppose I am without feeling?'</DD>

<DD>
'I suppose you are always interfering with your own feelings and those
of other people, and dogmatizing about the irrationality of this, that,
and the other sentiment, and then ordering it to be suppressed because
you imagine it to be inconsistent with logic.'</DD>

<DD>
'I do right.'</DD>

<DD>
Frances had stepped out of sight into a sort of little pantry. She soon
reappeared.</DD>

<DD>
'You do right? Indeed, no! You are much mistaken if you think so. Just!
De so good as to let me get to the fire, Mr. Hunsden; I have something
to cook.' (An interval occupied in settling a casserole on the fire; then,
while she stirred its contents.) 'Right! as if it were right to crush any
pleasureable sentiment that God has given to man, especially any sentiment
that, like patriotism, spreads man's selfishness in wider circles' (fire
stirred, dish put down before it).</DD>

<DD>
'Were you born in Switzerland?'</DD>

<DD>
'I should think so, or else why should I call it my country?'</DD>

<DD>
'And where did you get your English features and figure?'</DD>

<DD>
'I am English too -- half the blood in my veins is English; thus I have
a right to a double power of patriotism, possessing an interest in two
noble, free, and fortunate countries.'</DD>

<DD>
'You had an English mother?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, yes; and you, I suppose, had a mother from the moon or from Utopia,
since not a nation in Europe has a claim on your interest?'</DD>

<DD>
'On the contrary, I'm a universal patriot, if you could understand me rightly.
My country is the world.'</DD>

<DD>
'Sympathies so widely diffused must be very shallow. Will you have the
goodness to come to table. -- Monsieur' (to me, who appeared to be now
absorbed in reading by moonlight), 'monsieur, supper is served.'</DD>

<DD>
This was said in quite a different voice to that in which she had been
bandying phrases with Mr. Hunsden -- not so short, graver and softer.</DD>

<DD>
'Frances, what do you mean by preparing supper? We had no intention of
staying.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah, monsieur, but you have stayed, and supper is prepared; you have only
the alternative of eating it.'</DD>

<DD>
The meal was a foreign one, of course. It consisted in two small but tasty
dishes of meat prepared with skill and served with nicety; a salad and
<I>fromage fran&ccedil;ais</I> completed it. The business of eating interposed
a brief truce between the belligerents, but no sooner was supper disposed
of than they were at it again. The fresh subject of dispute ran on the
spirit of religious intolerance, which Mr. Hunsden affirmed to exist strongly
in Switzerland, notwithstanding the professed attachment of the Swiss to
freedom. Here Frances had greatly the worst of it, not only because she
was unskilled to argue, but because her own real opinions on the point
in question happened to coincide pretty nearly with Mr. Hunsden's, and
she only contradicted him out of opposition. At last she gave in, confessing
that she thought as he thought, but bidding him take notice that she did
not consider herself beaten.</DD>

<DD>
'No more did the French at Waterloo,' said Hunsden.</DD>

<DD>
'There is no comparison between the cases,' rejoined Frances; 'mine was
a sham fight.'</DD>

<DD>
'Sham or real, it's up with you.'</DD>

<DD>
'No; though I have neither logic nor wealth of words, yet in a case where
my opinion really differed from yours, I would adhere to it when I had
not another word to say in its defence; you should be baffled by dumb determination.
You speak of Waterloo! Your Wellington ought to have been conquered there,
according to Napoleon; but he persevered in spite of the laws of war, and
was victorious in defiance of military tactics. I would do as he did.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll he bound for it you would; probably you have some of the same sort
of stubborn stuff in you.'</DD>

<DD>
'I should be sorry if I had not. He and Tell were brothers, and I'd scorn
the Swiss, man or woman, who had none of the much-enduring nature of our
heroic William in his soul.'</DD>

<DD>
'If Tell was like Wellington, he was an ass.'</DD>

<DD>
'Does not <I>ass</I> mean <I>baudet</I>?' asked Frances, turning to me.</DD>

<DD>
'No, no,' replied I,. 'it means an <I>esprit fort</I>. And now,' I continued,
as I saw that fresh occasion of strife was brewing between these two, 'it
is high time to go.'</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden rose. 'Good-bye,' said he to Frances. 'I shall be off for this
glorious England to-morrow, and it maybe twelve months or more before I
come to Brussels again. Whenever I do come I'll seek you out, and you shall
see if I don't find means to make you fiercer than a dragon. You've done
pretty well this evening, but next interview you shall challenge me outright.
Meantime you're doomed to become Mrs. William Crimsworth, I suppose. Poor
young lady! But you have a spark of spirit; cherish it, and give the professor
the full benefit thereof.'</DD>

<DD>
'Are you married, Mr. Hunsden?' asked Frances suddenly.</DD>

<DD>
'No. I should have thought you might have guessed I was a Benedict by my
look.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, whenever you marry, don't take a wife out of Switzerland; for if
you begin blaspheming Helvetia and cursing the cantons -- above all, if
you mention the word <I>ass</I> in the same breath with the name Tell (for
ass <I>is</I> baudet, I know, though monsieur is pleased to translate it
<I>esprit fort</I>) -- your mountain maid will some night smother her Breton-bretonnant,
even as your own Shakespeare's Othello smothered Desdemona.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am warned,' said Hunsden; 'and so are you, lad' (nodding to me). 'I
hope yet to hear of a travesty of the Moor and his gentle lady, in which
the parts shall be reversed according to the plan just sketched -- you,
however, being in my nightcap. -- Farewell, mademoiselle!' He bowed on
her hand, absolutely like Sir Charles Grandison on that of Harriet Byron;
adding, 'Death from such fingers would not he without charms.'</DD>

<DD>
'Mon Dieu!' murmured Frances, opening her large eyes and lifting her distinctly
arched brows; 'c'est qu'il fait des compliments! je ne m'y suis pas attendu.'
She smiled, half in ire, half in mirth, curtsied with foreign grace, and
so they parted.</DD>

<DD>
No sooner had we got into the street than Hunsden collared me.</DD>

<DD>
'And that is your lace-mender?' said he; 'and you reckon you have done
a fine, magnanimous thing in offering to marry her? You, a scion of Seacombe,
have proved your disdain of social distinctions by taking up with an <I>ouvri&egrave;re</I>!
And I pitied the fellow, thinking his feelings had misled him, and that
he had hurt himself by contracting a low match!'</DD>

<DD>
'Just let go my collar, Hunsden.'</DD>

<DD>
On the contrary, he swayed me to and fro; I grappled him round the waist.
It was dark, the street lonely and lampless. We had then a tug for it;
and after we had both rolled on the pavement, and with difficulty picked
ourselves up, we agreed to walk on more soberly.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, that's my lace-mender,' said I; 'and she is to be mine for life --
God willing.'</DD>

<DD>
'God is not willing -- you can't suppose it. What business have you to
be suited so well with a partner? And she treats you with a sort of respect,
too, and says "monsieur," and modulates her tone in addressing you, actually
as if you were something superior! She could not evince more deference
to such a one as I, were she favoured by fortune to the supreme extent
of being my choice instead of yours.'</DD>

<DD>
'Hunsden, you're a puppy. But you've only seen the title-page of my happiness;
you don't know the tale that follows; you cannot conceive the interest
and sweet variety and thrilling excitement of the narrative.'</DD>

<DD>
Hunsden -- speaking low and deep, for we had now entered a busier street
-- desired me to hold my peace, threatening to do something dreadful if
