It was two o'clock when I returned to my lodgings; my dinner, just brought
in from a neighbouring hotel, smoked on the table. I sat down thinking
to cat: had the plate been heaped with potsherds and broken glass instead
of boiled beef and haricots, I could not have made a more signal failure.
Appetite had forsaken me. Impatient of seeing food which I could not taste,
I put it all aside into a cupboard, and then demanded, 'What shall I do
till evening?' for before 6 p.m. it would be vain to seek the Rue Notre
Dame aux Neiges; its inhabitant (for me it had but one) was detained by
her vocation elsewhere. I walked in the streets of Brussels, and I walked
in my own room, from two o'clock till six. Never once in that space of
time did I sit down; I was in my chamber when the last-named hour struck.
I had just bathed my face and feverish hands, and was standing near the
glass. My cheek was crimson, my eye was flame; still all my features looked
quite settled and calm. Descending swiftly the stair and stepping out,
I was glad to see twilight drawing on in clouds; such shade was to me like
a grateful screen, and the chill of later autumn, breathing in a fitful
wind from the north-west, met me as a refreshing coolness. Still I saw
it was cold to others, for the women I passed were wrapped in shawls, and
the men had their coats buttoned close.</DD>

<DD>
When are we quite happy? Was I so then? No. An urgent and growing dread
worried my nerves, and had worried them since the first moment good tidings
had reached me. How was Frances? It was ten weeks since I had seen her,
six since I had heard from her or of her. I had answered her letter by
a brief note, friendly but calm, in which no mention of continued correspondence
or further visits was made. At that hour my bark hung on the topmost curl
of a wave of fate, and I knew not on what shoal the onward rush of the
billow might hurl it. I would not then attach her destiny to mine by the
slightest thread. If doomed to split on the rock or run aground on the
sandbank, I was resolved no other vessel should share my disaster; but
six weeks was a long time, and could it be that she was still well and
doing well? Were not all sages agreed in declaring that happiness finds
no climax on earth? Dared I think that but half a street now divided me
from the full cup of contentment -- the draught drawn from waters said
to flow only in heaven?</DD>

<DD>
I was at the door; I entered the quiet house; I mounted the stairs. The
lobby was void and still, all the doors closed. I looked for the neat green
mat; it lay duly in its place.</DD>

<DD>
'Signal of hope!' I said, and advanced. 'But I will he a little calmer;
I am not going to rush in and get up a scene directly.' Forcibly staying
my eager step, I paused on the mat.</DD>

<DD>
'What an absolute hush! Is she in? Is anybody in?' I demanded to myself.
A little tinkle, as of cinders falling from a grate, replied; a movement
-- a fire was gently stirred; and the slight rustle of life continuing,
a step paced equably backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards in
the apartment. Fascinated, I stood, more fixedly fascinated when a voice
rewarded the attention of my strained ear -- so low, so self-addressed
I never fancied the speaker otherwise than alone; solitude might speak
thus in a desert, or in the hall of a forsaken house.</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
'"And ne'er but once, my son," he said,</DD>

<DD>
'Was yon dark cavern trod --</DD>

<DD>
In persecution's iron days,</DD>

<DD>
When the land was left by God.</DD>

<DD>
From Bewley's bog, with slaughter red,</DD>

<DD>
A wanderer hither drew.</DD>

<DD>
And oft he stopped and turned his head,</DD>

<DD>
As by fits the night-winds blew.</DD>

<DD>
For trampling round by Cheviot edge</DD>

<DD>
Were heard the troopers keen,</DD>

<DD>
And frequent from the Whitelaw ridge</DD>

<DD>
The death-shot flashed between,"' etc., etc.</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
The old Scotch ballad was partly recited, then dropped. A pause ensued;
then another strain followed, in French, of which the purport, translated,
ran as follows: --</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
'I gave, at first, attention close;</DD>

<DD>
Then interest warm ensued;</DD>

<DD>
From interest, as improvement rose,</DD>

<DD>
Succeeded gratitude.</DD>

<DD>
'Obedience was no effort soon,</DD>

<DD>
And labour was no pain;</DD>

<DD>
If tired, a word, a glance alone</DD>

<DD>
Would give me strength again.</DD>

<DD>
'From others of the studious band</DD>

<DD>
Ere long he singled me,</DD>

<DD>
But only by more close demand</DD>

<DD>
And sterner urgency.</DD>

<DD>
'The task he from another took,</DD>

<DD>
From me he did reject;</DD>

<DD>
He would no slight omission brook</DD>

<DD>
And suffer no defect.</DD>

<DD>
'If my companions went astray,</DD>

<DD>
He scarce their wanderings blamed.</DD>

<DD>
If I but faltered in the way</DD>

<DD>
His anger fiercely flamed.'</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
Something stirred in an adjoining chamber. It would not do to be surprised
eavesdropping. I tapped hastily, and as hastily entered. Frances was just
before me; she had been walking slowly in her room, and her step was checked
by my advent. Twilight only was with her, and tranquil, ruddy firelight;
to these sisters, the bright and the dark, she had been speaking, ere I
entered, in poetry. Sir Walter Scott's voice, to her a foreign, far-off
sound, a mountain echo, had uttered itself in the first stanzas; the second,
I thought, from the style and the substance, was the language of her own
heart. Her face was grave, its expression concentrated. She bent on me
an unsmiling eye -- an eye just resumed from abstraction, just awaking
from dreams. Well arranged was her simple attire, smooth her dark hair,
orderly her tranquil room; but what -- with her thoughtful look, her serious
self- reliance, her bent to meditation and happy inspiration -- what had
she to do with love? 'Nothing,' was the answer of her own sad though gentle
countenance. It seemed to say, 'I must cultivate fortitude and cling to
poetry; one is to be my support and the other my solace through life. Human
affections do not bloom, nor do human passions glow for me.' Other women
have such thoughts. Frances, had she been as desolate as she deemed, would
not have been worse off than thousands of her sex. Look at the rigid and
formal race of old maids -- the race whom all despise; they have fed themselves,
from youth upwards, on maxims of resignation and endurance. Many of them
get ossified with the dry diet. Self-control is so continually their thought,
so perpetually their object, that at last it absorbs the softer and more
agreeable qualifies of their nature, and they die mere models of austerity,
fashioned out of a little parchment and much bone. Anatomists will tell
you that there is a heart in the withered old maid's carcass, the same
as in that of any cherished wife or proud mother in the land. Can this
be so? I really don't know, but feel inclined to doubt it.</DD>

<DD>
I came forward, bade Frances 'good-evening,' and took my seat. The chair
I had chosen was one she had probably just left; it stood by a little table
where were her open desk and papers. I know not whether she had fully recognized
me at first, but she did so now; and in a voice soft but quiet she returned
my greeting. I had shown no eagerness; she took her cue from me, and evinced
no surprise. We met as we had always met, as master and pupil -- nothing
more. I proceeded to handle the papers. Frances, observant and serviceable,
stepped into an inner room, brought a candle, lit it, placed it by me,
then drew the curtain over the lattice, and having added a little fresh
fuel to the already bright fire, she drew a second chair to the table and
sat down at my right hand, a little removed. The paper on the top was a
translation of some grave French author into English, but underneath lay
a sheet with stanzas. On this I laid hands. Frances half rose, made a movement
to recover the captured spoil, saying that was nothing -- a mere copy of
verses. I put by resistance with the decision I knew she never long opposed,
but on this occasion her fingers had fastened on the paper. I had quietly
to unloose them. Their hold dissolved to my touch; her hand shrunk away.
My own would fain have followed it, but for the present I forbade such
impulse. The first page of the sheet was occupied with the lines I had
overheard; the sequel was not exactly the writer's own experience, but
a composition by portions of that experience suggested. Thus, while egotism
was avoided, the fancy was exercised, and the heart satisfied. I translate
as before, and my translation is nearly literal. It continued thus: --</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
'When sickness stayed awhile my course,</DD>

<DD>
He seemed impatient still</DD>

<DD>
Because his pupil's flagging force</DD>

<DD>
Could not obey his will.</DD>

<DD>
'One day when summoned to the bed</DD>

<DD>
Where pain and I did strive</DD>

<DD>
I heard him, as he bent his head,</DD>

<DD>
say, "God, she <I>must</I> revive!"</DD>

<DD>
'I felt his band, with gentle stress,</DD>

<DD>
A moment laid on mine,</DD>

<DD>
And wished to mark my consciousness</DD>

<DD>
By some responsive sign.</DD>

<DD>
'But powerless then to speak or move</DD>

<DD>
I only felt within</DD>

<DD>
The sense of hope, the strength of love</DD>

<DD>
Their healing work begin.</DD>

<DD>
'And as he from the room withdrew,</DD>

<DD>
My heart his steps pursued;</DD>

<DD>
I longed to prove, by efforts new,</DD>

<DD>
My speechless gratitude.</DD>

<DD>
'When once again I took my place,</DD>

<DD>
Long vacant, in the class,</DD>

<DD>
Th' unfrequent smile across his face,</DD>

<DD>
Did for one moment pass.</DD>

<DD>
'The lessons done, the signal made</DD>

<DD>
Of glad release and play,</DD>

<DD>
He, as he passed, an instant stayed</DD>

<DD>
One kindly word to say.</DD>

<DD>
'"Jane, till to-morrow you are free</DD>

<DD>
From tedious task and rule;</DD>

<DD>
This afternoon I must not see</DD>

<DD>
That yet pale face in school.</DD>

<DD>
'"Seek in the garden shades a seat,</DD>

<DD>
Far from the playground din;</DD>

<DD>
The sun is warm, the air is sweet:</DD>

<DD>
Stay till I call you in."</DD>

<DD>
'A long and pleasant afternoon</DD>

<DD>
I passed in those green bowers,</DD>

<DD>
All silent, tranquil, and alone</DD>

<DD>
With birds, and bees, and flowers.</DD>

<DD>
'Yet when my master's voice I heard</DD>

<DD>
Call, from the window, "Jane!"</DD>

<DD>
I entered, joyful, at the word,</DD>

<DD>
The busy house again.</DD>

<DD>
'He, in the hall, paced up and down;</DD>

<DD>
He paused as I passed by;</DD>

<DD>
His forehead stem relaxed its frown;</DD>

<DD>
He raised his deep-set eye.</DD>

<DD>
'"Not quite so pale," he murmured low;</DD>

<DD>
"Now, Jane, go rest awhile."</DD>

<DD>
And as I smiled, his smoothened brow</DD>

<DD>
Returned as glad a smile.</DD>

<DD>
'My perfect health restored, he took</DD>

<DD>
His mien austere again,</DD>

<DD>
And, as before, he would not brook</DD>

<DD>
The slightest fault from Jane.</DD>

<DD>
'The longest task, the hardest theme,</DD>

<DD>
Fell to my share as erst,</DD>

<DD>
And still I toiled to place my name</DD>

<DD>
In every study first.</DD>

<DD>
'He yet begrudged and stinted praise;</DD>

<DD>
But I had learnt to read</DD>

<DD>
The secret meaning of his face,</DD>

<DD>
And that was my best meed.</DD>

<DD>
'Even when his hasty temper spoke</DD>

<DD>
In tones that sorrow stirred</DD>

<DD>
My grief was lulled as soon as woke</DD>

<DD>
By some relenting word.</DD>

<DD>
'And when he lent some precious book.</DD>

<DD>
Or gave some fragrant flower,</DD>

<DD>
I did not quail to envy's look,</DD>

<DD>
Upheld by pleasure's power.</DD>

<DD>
'At last our school ranks took their ground:</DD>

<DD>
The hard-fought field I won;</DD>

<DD>
The prize, a laurel-wreath, was bound</DD>

<DD>
My throbbing forehead on.</DD>

<DD>
'Low at my master's knee I bent,</DD>

<DD>
The offered crown to meet;</DD>

<DD>
Its green leaves through my temples sent</DD>

<DD>
A thrill as wild as sweet.</DD>

<DD>
'The strong pulse of ambition struck</DD>

<DD>
In every vein I owned;</DD>

<DD>
At the same instant bleeding broke</DD>

<DD>
A secret, inward wound.</DD>

<DD>
'The hour of triumph was to me</DD>

<DD>
The hour of sorrow sore;</DD>

<DD>
A day hence I must cross the sea,</DD>

<DD>
Ne'er to recross it more.</DD>

<DD>
'An hour hence, in my master's room,</DD>

<DD>
I with him sat alone,</DD>

<DD>
And told him what a dreary gloom</DD>

<DD>
O'er joy had parting thrown.</DD>

<DD>
'He little said; the time was brief,</DD>

<DD>
The ship was soon to sail,</DD>

<DD>
And while I sobbed in bitter grief,</DD>

<DD>
My master but looked pale.</DD>

<DD>
'They called in haste; he bade me go,</DD>

<DD>
Then snatched me back again;</DD>

<DD>
He held me fast and murmured low,</DD>

<DD>
"Why will they part us, Jane?</DD>

<DD>
'"Were you not happy in my care?</DD>

<DD>
Did I not faithful prove?</DD>

<DD>
Will others to my darling bear</DD>

<DD>
As true, as deep a love?</DD>

<DD>
'"O God, watch o'er my foster child</DD>

<DD>
O guard her gentle head!</DD>

<DD>
When winds are high and tempests wild,</DD>

<DD>
Protection round her spread.</DD>

<DD>
'"They call again; leave, then, my breast;</DD>

<DD>
Quit thy true shelter, Jane;</DD>

<DD>
But when deceived, repulsed opprest,</DD>

<DD>
Come home to me again."'</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>
I read, then dreamily made marks on the margin with my pencil, thinking
all the while of other things -- thinking that 'Jane' was now at my side,
no child, but a girl of nineteen; and she might be mine, so my heart affirmed.
Poverty's curse was taken off me, envy and jealousy were far away, and
unapprised of this our quiet meeting. The frost of the master's manner
might melt; I felt the thaw coming fast, whether I would or not. No further
need for the eye to practise a hard look, for the brow to compress its
expanse into a stem fold; it was now permitted to suffer the outward revelation
of the inward glow, to seek, demand, elicit an answering ardour. While
musing thus I thought that the grass on Hermon never drank the fresh dews
of sunset more gratefully than my feelings drank the bliss of this hour.</DD>

<DD>
Frances rose as if restless; she passed before me to stir the fire, which
did not want stirring; she lifted and put down the little ornaments on
the mantelpiece; her dress waved within a yard of me; slight, straight,
and elegant, she stood erect on the hearth.</DD>

<DD>
There are impulses we can control, but there are others which.' control
us, because they attain us with a tiger leap, and are our masters ere we
have seen them. Perhaps, though, such impulses are seldom altogether bad;
perhaps reason, by a process as brief as quiet, a process that is finished
ere felt, has ascertained the sanity of the deed instinct meditates, and
feels justified in remaining passive while it is performed. I know I did
not reason, I did not plan or intend; yet, whereas one moment I was sitting
solus on the chair near the table, the next I held Frances on my knee,
placed there with sharpness and decision, and retained with exceeding tenacity.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur!' cried Frances, and was still. Not another word escaped her
lips. Sorely confounded she seemed during the lapse of the first few moments;
but the amazement soon subsided. Terror did not succeed, nor fury. After
all, she was only a little nearer than she had ever been before to one
she habitually respected and trusted. Embarrassment might have impelled
her to contend, but self-respect checked resistance where resistance was
useless.</DD>

<DD>
'Frances, how much regard have you for me?' was my demand. No answer; the
situation was yet too new and surprising to permit speech. On this consideration
I compelled myself for some seconds to tolerate her silence, though impatient
of it. Presently I repeated the same question, probably not in the calmest
of tones. She looked at me. My face, doubtless, was no model of composure,
my eyes no still wells of tranquillity.</DD>

<DD>
'Do speak,' I urged; and a very low, hurried, yet still arch voice said,
--</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur, vous me fa&icirc;tes mal; de grce lchez un peu ma main droite.'</DD>

<DD>
In truth I became aware that I was holding the said 'main droite' in a
somewhat ruthless grasp. I did as desired, and, for the third time, asked
more gently, --</DD>

<DD>
'Frances, how much regard have you for me?'</DD>

<DD>
'Mon maitre, j'en ai beaucoup,' was the truthful rejoinder,</DD>

<DD>
'Frances, have you enough to give yourself to me as my wife? to accept
me as your husband?'</DD>

<DD>
I felt the agitation of the heart; I saw 'the purple light of love' cast
its glowing reflection on cheeks, temples, neck. I desired to consult the
eye, but sheltering lash and lid forbade.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur,' said the soft voice at last -- 'monsieur d&eacute;sire savoir
si je consens -- si, enfin, si je veux me marier avec lui?'</DD>

<DD>
'Justement.'</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur sera-t-il aussi bon mari qu'il a &eacute;t&eacute; bon ma&icirc;tre?'</DD>

<DD>
'I will try, Frances.'</DD>

<DD>
A pause; then with a new yet still subdued inflection of the voice an inflection
which provoked while it pleased me -- accompanied, too, by a 'sourire &agrave;la
fois fin et timide' in perfect harmony with the tone, --</DD>

<DD>
'C'est &agrave;dire, monsieur sera toujours un peu ent&ecirc;t&eacute;,
exigeant, volontaire --'</DD>

<DD>
'Have I been so, Frances?'</DD>

<DD>
'Mais oui; vous le savez bien.'</DD>

<DD>
'Have I been nothing else?'</DD>

<DD>
'Mais oui; vous avez &eacute;t&eacute; mon meilleur ami.'</DD>

<DD>
'And what, Frances, are you to me?'</DD>

<DD>
'Votre d&eacute;vou&eacute;e &eacute;l&egrave;ve, qui vous aime de tout
son c&brvbar;ur.'</DD>

<DD>
'Will my pupil consent to pass her life with me? Speak English now, Frances.'</DD>

<DD>
Some moments were taken for reflection. The answer, pronounced slowly,
ran thus, --</DD>

<DD>
'You have always made me happy. I like to hear you speak; I like to see
you; I like to be near you. I believe you are very good, and very superior.
I know you are stern to those who are careless and idle, but you are kind,
very kind to the attentive and industrious, even if they are not clever.
Master, I should be <I>glad</I> to five with you always;' and she made
a sort of movement as if she would have clung to me, but restraining herself,
she only added with earnest emphasis, 'Master, I consent to pass my life
with you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very well, Frances.'</DD>

<DD>
I drew her a little nearer to my heart; I took a first kiss from her lips,
thereby sealing the compact now framed between us. Afterwards she and I
were silent, nor was our silence brief Frances' thoughts during this interval
I know not, nor did I attempt to guess them; I was not occupied in searching
her countenance, nor in otherwise troubling her composure. The peace I
felt I wished her to feel. My arm, it is true, still detained her, but
with a restraint that was gentle enough, so long as no opposition tightened
it. My gaze was on the red fire, my heart was measuring its own content;
it sounded and sounded, and found the depth fathomless.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur,' at last said my quiet companion, as stirless in her happiness
as a mouse in its terror. Even now in speaking she scarcely lifted her
head.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, Frances?' I like unexaggerated intercourse; it is not my way to
overpower with amorous epithets, any more than to worry with selfishly
importunate caresses.</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur est raisonnable, n'est-ce pas?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, especially when I am requested to be so in English. But why do you
ask me? You see nothing vehement or obtrusive in my manner; am I not tranquil
enough?'</DD>

<DD>
'Ce n'est pas cela --'began Frances.</DD>

<DD>
'English!' I reminded her.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, monsieur, I wished merely to say that I should like, of course,
to retain my employment of teaching. You will teach still, I suppose, monsieur?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh yes; it is all I have to depend on.'</DD>

<DD>
'Bon -- I mean good. Thus we shall have both the same profession. I like
that; and my efforts to get on will be as unrestrained as yours -- will
they not, monsieur?'</DD>

<DD>
'You are laying plans to be independent of me,' said I.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, monsieur; I must be no encumbrance to you -- no burden in any way.'</DD>

<DD>
'But, Frances, I have not yet told you what my prospects are. I have left
M. Pelet's; and after nearly a month's seeking I have got another place,
with a salary of three thousand francs a year, which I can easily double
by a little additional exertion. Thus you see it would be useless for you
to fag yourself by going out to give lessons; on six thousand francs you
and I can live, and live well.'</DD>

<DD>
Frances seemed to consider. There is something flattering to man's strength,
something consonant to his honourable pride, in the idea of becoming the
providence of what he loves -- feeding and clothing it, as God does the
lilies of the field. So, to decide her resolution, I went on, --</DD>

<DD>
'Life has been painful and laborious enough to you so far, Frances; you
require complete rest. Your twelve hundred francs would not form a very
important addition to our income, and what sacrifice of comfort to earn
it! Relinquish your labours -- you must be weary -- and let me have the
happiness of giving you rest.'</DD>

<DD>
I am not sure whether Frances had accorded due attention to my harangue.
Instead of answering me with her usual respectful promptitude, she only
sighed, and said, --</DD>

<DD>
'How rich you are, monsieur!' and then she stirred uneasy in my arms. 'Three
thousand francs!' she murmured, 'while I get only twelve hundred!' She
went on faster. 'However, it must be so for the present; and, monsieur,
were you not saying something about my giving up my place? Oh no! I shall
hold it fast,' and her little fingers emphatically tightened on mine. 'Think
of my marrying you to be kept by you, monsieur! I could not do it; and
how dull my days would be! You would be away teaching in close, noisy schoolrooms
from morning till evening, and I should be lingering at home, unemployed
and solitary. I should get depressed and sullen, and you would soon tire
of me.'</DD>

<DD>
'Frances, you could read and study -- two things you like so well.'</DD>

<DD>
'Monsieur, I could not. I like a contemplative life, but I like an active
life better. I must act in some way, and act with you. I have taken notice,
monsieur, that people who are only in each other's company for amusement
never really like each other so well, or esteem each other so highly, as
those who work together, and perhaps suffer together.'</DD>

<DD>
'You speak God's truth,' said I at last; 'and you shall have your own way,
for it is the best way. Now, as a reward for such ready consent, give me
a voluntary kiss.'</DD>

<DD>
After some hesitation, natural to a novice in the art of kissing, she brought
her lips into very shy and gentle contact with my forehead. I took the
small gift as a loan, and repaid it promptly, and with generous interest.</DD>

<DD>
I know not whether Frances was really much altered since the time I first
saw her; but as I looked at her now, I felt that she was singularly changed
for me. The sad eye, the pale cheek, the dejected and joyless countenance
I remembered as her early attributes were quite gone, and now I saw a face
dressed in graces; smile, dimple, and rosy tint rounded its contours and
brightened its hues. I had been accustomed to nurse a flattering idea that
my strong attachment to her proved some particular perspicacity in my nature.
She was not handsome, she was not rich, she was not even accomplished,
yet was she my life's treasure. I must, then, be a man of peculiar discernment.
To-night my eyes opened on the mistake I had made; I began to suspect that
it was only my tastes which were unique, not my power of discovering and
appreciating the superiority of moral worth over physical charms. For me
Frances had physical charms. In her there was no deformity to get over,
none of those prominent defects of eyes, teeth, complexion, shape, which
hold at bay the admiration of the boldest male champions of intellect (for
women can love a downright ugly man if he be but talented). Had she been
either '&eacute;dent&eacute;e, myope, rugueuse, ou bossue,' my feelings
towards her might still have been kindly, but they could never have been
impassioned. I had affection for the poor little misshapen Sylvie, but
for her I could never have had love. It is true Frances' mental points
had been the first to interest me, and they still retained the strongest
hold on my preference; but I liked the graces of her person too. I derived
a pleasure, purely material, from contemplating the clearness of her brown
eyes, the fairness of her fine skin, the purity of her well-set teeth,
the proportion of her delicate form; and that pleasure I could ill have
dispensed with. It appeared, then, that I too was a sensualist, in my temperate
and fastidious way.</DD>

Now, reader, during the last two pages I have been giving you honey fresh
from flowers, but you must not live entirely on food so luscious; taste,
then, a little gall -- just a drop, by way of change.</DD>

At a somewhat late hour I returned to my lodgings. Having temporarily forgotten
that man had any such coarse cares as those of eating and drinking, I went
to bed fasting. I had been excited and in action all day, and had tasted
no food since eight that morning; besides, for a fortnight past I had known
no rest either of body or mind. The last few hours had been a sweet delirium;
it would not subside now, and till long after midnight broke with troubled
ecstasy the rest I so much needed. At last I dozed, but not for long; it
was yet quite dark when I awoke, and my waking was like that of Job when
a spirit passed before his face, and, like him, 'the hair of my flesh stood
up.' I might continue the parallel, for in truth, though I saw nothing,
yet 'a thing was secretly brought unto me, and mine car received a little
thereof. There was silence, and I heard a voice,' saying, 'In the midst
of life we are in death.'</DD>

<DD>
That sound, and the sensation of chill anguish accompanying it, many would
have regarded as supernatural; but I recognized it at once as the effect
of reaction. Man is ever clogged with his mortality, and it was my mortal
nature which now faltered and plained -- my nerves which jarred and gave
a false sound, because the soul, of late rushing headlong to an aim, had
overstrained the body's comparative weakness. A horror of great darkness
fell upon me. I felt my chamber invaded by one I had known formerly, but
had thought for ever departed. I was temporarily a prey to hypochondria.</DD>

She had been my acquaintance -- nay, my guest, once before in boyhood.
I had entertained her at bed and hoard for a year; for that space of time
I had her to myself in secret. She lay with me, she ate with me, she walked
out with me, showing me nooks in woods, hollows in hills, where we could
sit together, and where she could drop her drear veil over me and so hide
sky and sun, grass and green tree; taking me entirely to her death-cold
bosom, and holding me with arms of bone. What tales she would tell me at
such hours! What songs she would recite in my ears! How she would discourse
to me of her own country -- the grave -- and again and again promise to
conduct me there ere long; and, drawing me to the very brink of a black,
sullen river, show me, on the other side, shores unequal with mound, monument,
and tablet, standing up in a glimmer more hoary than moonlight. 'Necropolis!'
she would whisper, pointing to the pale piles, and add, 'It contains a
mansion prepared for you.'</DD>

But my boyhood was lonely, parentless, uncheered by brother or sister;
and there was no marvel that, just as I rose to youth, a sorceress, finding
me lost in vague mental wanderings, with many affections and few objects,
glowing aspirations and gloomy prospects, strong desires and slender hopes,
should lift up her illusive lamp to me in the distance, and lure me to
her vaulted home of horrors. No wonder her spells <I>then</I> had power;
but <I>now</I>, when my course was widening, my prospect brightening, when
my affections had found a rest, when my desires, folding wings, weary with
long flight, had just alighted on the very lap of Fruition, and nestled
there, warm, content, under the caress of a soft hand -- why did hypochondria
accost me now?</DD>

<DL>I repulsed her as one would a dreaded and ghastly concubine coming
to embitter a husband's heart towards his young bride. In vain. She kept
her sway over me for that night and the next day, and eight succeeding
days. Afterwards my spirits began slowly to recover their tone; my appetite
returned, and in a fortnight I was well. I had gone about as usual all
the time, and had said nothing to anybody of what I felt; but I was glad
when the evil spirit departed from me, and I could again seek Frances,
and sit at her side, freed from the dreadful tyranny of my demon.</DL>
