Farewell to the Romans - The Landlord and His Niece - Set Out 

as a Traveller.





ON reaching the plain above, I found my Romany friends 

breakfasting, and on being asked by Mr. Petulengro to join 

them, I accepted the invitation.  No sooner was breakfast 

over than I informed Ursula and her husband that they would 

find the property, which I had promised them, in the dingle, 

commanding the little pony Ambrol to their best care.  I took 

leave of the whole company, which was itself about to break 

up camp and to depart in the direction of London, and made 

the best of my way to the public-house.  I had a small bundle 

in my hand, and was dressed in the same manner as when I 

departed from London, having left my waggoner's slop with the 

other effects in the dingle.  On arriving at the public-

house, I informed the landlord that I was come for my horse, 

inquiring, at the same time, whether he could not accommodate 

me with a bridle and saddle.  He told me that the bridle and 

saddle, with which I had ridden the horse on the preceding 

day, were at my service for a trifle; that he had received 

them some time since in payment for a debt, and that he had 

himself no use for them.  The leathers of the bridle were 

rather shabby, and the bit rusty, and the saddle was old 

fashioned; but I was happy to purchase them for seven 

shillings, more especially as the landlord added a small 

valise, which he said could be strapped to the saddle, and 

which I should find very convenient for carrying my things 

in.  I then proceeded to the stable, told the horse we were 

bound on an expedition, and giving him a feed of corn, left 

him to discuss it, and returned to the bar-room to have a 

little farewell chat with the landlord, and at the same time 

to drink with him a farewell glass of ale.  Whilst we were 

talking and drinking, the niece came and joined us: she was a 

decent, sensible young woman, who appeared to take a great 

interest in her uncle, whom she regarded with a singular 

mixture of pride and, disapprobation - pride for the renown 

which he had acquired by his feats of old, and disapprobation 

for his late imprudences.  She said that she hoped that his 

misfortunes would be a warning to him to turn more to his God 

than he had hitherto done, and to give up cock-fighting and 

other low-life practices.  To which the landlord replied, 

that with respect to cock-fighting he intended to give it up 

entirely, being determined no longer to risk his capital upon 

birds, and with respect to his religious duties, he should 

attend the church of which he was churchwarden at least once 

a quarter, adding, however, that he did not intend to become 

either canter or driveller, neither of which characters would 

befit a publican surrounded by such customers as he was, and 

that to the last day of his life he hoped to be able to make 

use of his fists.  After a stay of about two hours I settled 

accounts, and having bridled and saddled my horse, and 

strapped on my valise, I mounted, shook hands with the 

landlord and his niece, and departed, notwithstanding that 

they both entreated me to tarry until the evening, it being 

then the heat of the day.
