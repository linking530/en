The Guests</H3></CENTER>
Sept. 23rd. Our guests arrived about three weeks ago. Lord and Lady Lowborough
have now been married above eight months; and I will do the lady the credit
to say that her husband is quite an altered man: his looks, his spirits,
and his temper are all perceptibly changed for the better since I last
saw him. But there is room for improvement still. He is not always cheerful
nor always contented, and she often complains of his ill humour, which,
how ever, of all persons, <I>she</I> ought to be the last to accuse him
of, as he never displays it against her, except for such conduct as would
provoke a saint He adores her still, and would go to the world's end to
please her, She knows her power, and she uses it too; but well knowing
that to wheedle and coax is safer than to command, she judiciously tempers
her despotism with flattery and blandishments enough to make him deem himself
a favoured and a happy man. And yet, at times, a sombre shadow overclouds
his brow even In her presence, but evidently the result of despondency
rather than of ill humour, and generally occasioned by some display of
her ill-regulated temper or misguided mind--some wanton trampling upon
his most cherished opinions--some seck less disregard of principle that
makes him bitterly regret that she is not as good as she is charming and
beloved. I pity him from my heart, for I know the misery of such regrets.

<P>&nbsp;But she has another way of tormenting him, In which I am a fellow-sufferer--or
might be, if I chose to regard myself as such. This is by openly but not
too glaringly coquetting with Mr Huntingdon, who is quite willing to be
her partner in the game; but I don't care for it, because with him, I know
there is nothing but personal vanity and a mischievous desire to excite
my jealousy, and perhaps to torment his friend; and she, no doubt, is actuated
by much the same motives; only there is more of malice and less of playfulness
in <I>her</I> manoeuvres. It is obviously, therefore, my interest to disappoint
them both, as far as I am concerned, by preserving a cheerful, undisturbed
serenity throughout; and accordingly I endeavour to show the fullest confidence
In my husband and the greatest indifference to the arts of my attractive
guest. I have never reproached the former but once, and that was for laughing
at Lord Lowborough's depressed and anxious countenance one evening, when
they had both been particularly provoking; and then, indeed, I said a good
deal on the subject, and rebuked him sternly enough; but he only laughed,
and said--

<P>&nbsp;`You can feel for him, Helen--can't you?'

<P>&nbsp;`I can feel for anyone that is unjustly treated,' I replied, `and
I can feel for those that injure them too,'

<P>&nbsp;`Why Helen, you are as jealous as he is!' cried he, laughing still
more; and I found it impossible to convince him of his mistake. So from
that time I have carefully refrained from any notice of the subject whatever,
and left Lord Lowborough to take care of himself. He either has not the
sense or the power to follow my example, though he does try to conceal
his uneasiness as well as he can; but still, it will appear in his face,
and his ill humour will peep out at intervals, though not in the expression
of open resentment--they never go far enough for that. But I confess I
do feel jealous at times--most painfully, bitterly so--when she sings and
plays to him, and he hangs over the instrument and dwells upon her voice
with no affected interest; for then, I know he is really delighted, and
I have no power to awaken similar fervour. I can amuse and please him with
my simple songs, but not delight him thus.

<P>&nbsp;I might retaliate if chose, for Mr Hargrave is disposed to be
very polite and attentive to me as his hostess--especially so when Arthur
is the most neglectful, whether in mistaken compassion for me, or ambitious
to show off his own good breeding by comparison with his friend's remissness,
I cannot tell; but in either case, his civilities are highly distasteful
to me. If Arthur is a little careless, of course it is unpleasant to have
the fault exaggerated by contrast; and to be pitied as a neglected wife
when I am not such, is an insult I can ill endure. But for hospitality's
sake, I endeavour to suppress my impulse of scarcely reasonable resentment,
and behave with decent civility to our guest, who, to give him his due,
is by no means a disagreeable companion: he has good conversational powers
and considerable Information and taste, and talks about things that Arthur
never could be brought to discuss, or to feel any interest in. But Arthur
dislikes me to talk to him, and is visibly annoyed by his commonest acts
of politeness: not that my husband has any unworthy suspicions of me--or
of his friend either, as I believe--but he dislikes me to have any pleasure
but in himself, any shadow of homage or kindness but such as he chooses
to vouchsafe: he knows he is my sun, but when he chooses to withhold his
light, he would have my sky to be all darkness; he cannot bear that I should
have a moon to mitigate the deprivation. This is unjust; and I am sometimes
tempted to tease him accordingly; but I won't yield to the temptation:
if he should carry his trifling with my feelings too far, I shall find
some other means of checking him.

<P>&nbsp;28th.--Yesterday we all went to the Grove, Mr Hargrave's much
neglected home. His mother frequently asks us over that she may have the
pleasure of her dear Walter's company; and this time she had invited us
to a dinner-party, and got together as many of the country gentry as were
within reach to meet us. The entertainment was very well got up; but I
could not help thinking about the cost of it all the time. I don't like
Mrs Hargrave; she is a hard, pretentious, worldly-minded woman. She has
money enough to live very comfortably, if she only knew how to use it judiciously,
and had taught her son to do the same; but she is ever straining to keep
up appearances, with that despicable pride that shuns the semblance of
poverty as of a shameful crime. She grinds her dependants, pinches her
servants, and deprives even her daughters and herself of the real comforts
of life, because she will not con sent to yield the palm in outward show
to those who have three times her wealth, and, above all, because she is
determined her cherished son shall be enabled to `hold up his head with
the high est gentleman in the land.' This same son, I imagine, is a man
of expensive habits--no reckless spendthrift, and no abandoned sensualist,
but one who likes to have `everything handsome about him,' and to go to
a certain length in youthful indulgences--not so much gratify his own tastes
as to maintain his reputation as a man of fashion In the world, and a respectable
fellow among his own lawless companions; while he is too selfish to consider
how many comforts might be obtained for his fond mother and sisters with
the money he thus wastes upon himself: as long as they can contrive to
make a respectable appearance once a year when they come to town, he gives
himself little concern about their private stintings and struggles at home.
This is a harsh judgment to form of `dear, noble-minded, generous-hearted
Walter,' but I fear it is too just.

<P>&nbsp;Mrs Hargrave's anxiety to make good matches for her daughters
is partly the cause and partly the result of these errors: by making a
figure in the world and showing them off to advantage, she hopes to obtain
better chances for them; and by thus living beyond her legitimate means
and lavishing so much on their brother, she renders them portionless, and
makes them burdens on her hands. Poor Milicent, I fear, has already fallen
a sacrifice to the manoeuvrings of this mistaken mother, who congratulates
herself on having so satisfactorily discharged her maternal duty, and hopes
to do as well for Esther. But Esther is a child as yet--a little merry
romp of fourteen: as honest-hearted, and as guileless and simple as her
sister, but with a fearless spirit of her own, that, I fancy, her mother
will find some difficulty in bending to her purposes.
