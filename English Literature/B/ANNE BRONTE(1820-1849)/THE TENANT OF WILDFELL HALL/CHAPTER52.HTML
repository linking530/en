FLUCTUATIONS</H3></CENTER>
The tardy gig had overtaken me at last. I entered it, and bade the man
who brought it drive to Grassdale Manor--I was too busy with my own thoughts
to care to drive it myself. I would see Mrs. Huntingdon--there could be
no impropriety in that now that her husband had been dead above a year--and
by her indifference or her joy at my unexpected arrival, I could soon tell
whether her heart was truly mine. But my companion, a loquacious, forward
fellow, was not disposed to leave me to the indulgence of my private cogitations.

<P>&nbsp;`There they go!' said he as the carriages filed away before us.
`There'll be brave doings on yonder <I>to-day</I>, as what come tomorra.--Know
anything of that family, sir? or you're a stranger in these parts?'

<P>&nbsp;`I know them by report.'

<P>&nbsp;`Humph!--There's the best of `em gone anyhow. And I suppose the
old missis is agoing to leave after this stir's gotten overed, and take
herself off, somewhere, to live on her bit of a jointure, and the young
`unit least the new `un (she's none so very young) is coming down to live
at the Grove.'

<P>&nbsp;`Is Mr. Hargrave married, then?'

<P>&nbsp;`Ay sir, a few months since. He should a been wed afore, to a
widow lady, but they couldn't agree over the money: she'd a rare long purse,
and Mr. Hargrave wanted it all to his-self, but she wouldn't let it go,
and so then they fell out. This one isn't quite as rich--nor as handsome
either, but she hasn't been married before. She's very plain they say,
and getting on to forty or past, and so, you know, if she didn't jump at
this hopportunity, she thought she'd never get a better. I guess she thought
such a handsOme young husband was worth all `at ever she had, and he might
take it and welcome; but I lay she'll rue her bargain afore long. They
say she begins already to see 'at he isn't not altogether that nice, generous,
perlite, delightful gentleman 'at she thought him afore marriage begins
a being careless, and masterful already. Ay, and she'll find him harder
and carelesser nor she thinks on.' `You seem to be well acquainted with
him,' I observed. `I am, sir; I've known him since he was quite a young
gentleman; and a proud'un he was, and a wilful. I was servant yonder for
several years; but I couldn't stand their niggardly ways--she got ever
longer and worse did Missis, with her nipping and screwing, and watching
and grudging; so I thought I'd find another place as <I>what</I> came.'
And then he discoursed upon his present position as ostler at the Rose
and Crown, and how greatly superior it was to his former one, in comfort
and freedom, though inferior in outward respectability; and entered into
various details respecting the domestic economy at the Grove, and the characters
of Mrs. Hargrave and her son,--to which I gave no heed, being too much
occupied with my own anxious, fluttering anticipations and with the character
of the country through which we passed, that, in spite of the leafless
trees and snowy ground, had for some time begun to manifest unequivocal
signs of the approach to a gentleman's country seat. `Are we not near the
house?' said I, interrupting him in the middle of his discourse. `Yes,
sir; yond's the park.' My heart sank within me to behold that stately mansion
in the midst of its expansive grounds-he park as beautiful now, in its
wintry garb, as it could be in its summer glory; the majestic sweep, the
undulating swell and fall, displayed to full advantage in that robe of
dazzling purity, stainless and printless--save one long, winding track
left by the trooping deer--the stately timber-trees with their heavy laden
branches gleaming white against the dull, grey sky; the deep, encircling
woods; the broad expanse of water sleeping in frozen quiet; and the weeping
ash and willow drooping their snowclad boughs above it--all presented a
picture, striking, indeed, and pleasing to an unencumbered mind, but by
no means encouraging to me. There was one comfort however,-all this was
entailed upon little Arthur, and could not under any circumstances, strictly
speaking, be his mother's. But how was she situated? Overcoming with a
sudden effort my repugnance to mention her name to my garrulous companion,
I asked him if he knew whether her late husband had left a will, and how
the property had been disposed of. Oh, yes, he knew all about it; and I
was quickly informed that to her had been left the full control and management
of the estate during her son's minority, besides the absolute, unconditional
possession of her own fortune (but I knew her father had not given her
much), and the small additional sum that had been settled upon her before
marriage.

<P>&nbsp;Before the close of the explanation, we drew up at the park gates.
Now for the trial--if I should find her within--but alas! she might be
still at Staningley: her brother had given me no intimation to the contrary.
I enquired at the porter's lodge if Mrs. Huntingdon were at home. No, she
was with her aunt in ---hire, but was expected to return before Christmas.
She usually spent most of her time at Staningley, only coming to Grassdale
occasionally, when the management of affairs, or the interest of her tenants
and dependants required her presence.

<P>&nbsp;`Near what town is Staningley situated?' I asked. The requisite
information was soon obtained. `Now then, my man, give me the reins, and
we'll return to M---. I must have some breakfast at the Rose and Crown,
and then away to Staningley by the first coach for---"

<P>&nbsp;`You'll not get there to-day, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;`No matter, I don't want to get there to-day; I want to get there
to-morrow, and pass the night on the road.'

<P>&nbsp;`At an inn, sir? You'd better by half stay at <I>our</I> house;
and then start fresh to-morrow, and have the whole day for your journey.'

<P>&nbsp;`What, and lose twelve hours? not I.'

<P>&nbsp;`Perhaps, sir, you're <I>related</I> to Mrs. Huntingdon?' said
he, seeking to indulge his curiosity since his cupidity was not to be gratified.

<P>&nbsp;`I have not that honour.'

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! well,' returned he with a dubious, sidelong glance at my
splashed, grey trousers and rough P jacket. `But,' he added, encouragingly,
`there's many a fine lady like that `at has kinsfolks poorer nor what you
are, sir, I should think.'

<P>&nbsp;`No doubt,--and there's many a fine gentleman would esteem himself
vastly honoured to be able to claim kindred with the lady you mention.'

<P>&nbsp;He now cunningly glanced at my face. `Perhaps, sir, you <I>mean</I>
to--'

<P>&nbsp;I guessed what was coming, and checked the impertinent conjecture
with,--`Perhaps you'll be so good as to be quiet a moment. I'm busy.

<P>&nbsp;`Busy, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, in my mind, and don't want to have my cogitations disturbed.'

<P>&nbsp;`Indeed, sir!'

<P>&nbsp;You will see that my disappointment had not <I>very</I> greatly
affected me, or I should not have been able so quietly to bear with the
fellow's impertinence. The fact is I thought it as well--nay better, all
things considered, that I should not see her to-day,--that I should have
time to compose my mind for the interview--to prepare it for a heavier
disappointment, after the intoxicating delight experienced by this sudden
removal of my former apprehensions; not to mention that, after travelling
a night and a day without intermission, and rushing in hot haste through
six miles of new-fallen snow, I could not possibly be in a very presentable
condition.

<P>&nbsp;At M-- I had time before the coach started to replenish my forces
with a hearty breakfast, and to obtain the refreshment of my usual morning's
ablutions, and the amelioration of some slight change in my toilet,--and
also to dispatch a short note to my mother (excellent son that I was) to
assure her that I was still in existence and to excuse my nonappearance
at the expected time. It was a long journey to Staningley for those slow
travelling days; but I did not deny myself needful refreshment on the road,
nor even a night's rest at a way-side inn; choosing rather to brook a little
delay than to present myself worn, wild, and weatherbeaten before my mistress
and her aunt, who would be astonished enough to see me without that. Next
morning, therefore, I not only fortified myself with as substantial a breakfast
as my excited feelings would allow me to swallow, but I bestowed a little
more than usual time and care upon my toilet; and, furnished with a change
of linen from my small carpet-bag, well brushed clothes, well polished
boots, and neat new gloves,--I mounted `the Lightning,' and resumed my
journey. I had nearly two stages yet before me, but the coach, I was informed,
passed through the neighbourhood of Staningley, and, having desired to
be set down as near the Hall as possible, I had nothing to do but to sit
with folded arms and speculate upon the coming hour.

<P>&nbsp;It was a clear, frosty morning. The very fact of sitting exalted
aloft, surveying the snowy landscape and sweet, sunny sky, inhaling the
pure, bracing air, and crunching away over the crisp, frozen snow, was
exhilarating enough in itself, but add to this the idea of to what goal
I was hastening, and whom I expected to meet, and you may have some faint
conception of my frame of mind at the time--only a <I>faint</I> one though,
for my heart swelled with unspeakable delight, and my spirits rose almost
to madness--in spite of my prudent endeavours to bind them down to a reasonable
platitude' by thinking of the undeniable difference between Helen's rank
and mine; of all that she had passed through since our parting; of her
long, unbroken silence; and, above all, of her cool, cautious aunt, whose
counsels she would doubtless be careful not to slight again. These considerations
made my heart flutter with anxiety, and my chest heave with impatience
to get the crisis over, but they could not dim her image in my mind, or
mar the vivid recollection of what had been said and felt between us--or
destroy the keen anticipation of what was to be--in fact, I could not realize
their terrors now. Towards the close of the journey, however, a couple
of my fellow passengers kindly came to my assistance, and brought me low
enough.

<P>&nbsp;`Fine land this,' said one of them, pointing with his umbrella
to the wide fields on the right, conspicuous for their compact hedgerows,
deep, well-cut ditches, and fine timber-trees, growing sometimes on the
borders, sometimes in the midst of the enclosure;--`very fine land, if
you saw it in the summer or spring.'

<P>&nbsp;`Ay,' responded the others gruff elderly man, with a drab great
coat buttoned up to the chin and a cotton umbrella between his knees. `It's
old Maxwell's I suppose.'

<P>&nbsp;`It <I>was</I> his, sir, but he's dead now, you're aware, and
has left it all to his niece.'

<P>&nbsp;`All!'

<P>&nbsp;`Every rood of it,--and the mansion-house and all,--every hatom
of his worldly goods!--except just a trifle, by way of remembrance to his
nephew down in ---hire and an annuity to his wife.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's strange, sir!'

<P>&nbsp;`It is sir. And she wasn't his own niece neither; but he had no
near relations of his own--none but a nephew he'd quarrelled with--and
he always had a partiality for this one. And then his wife advised him
to it, they say: she'd brought most of the property, and it was her wish
that this lady should have it.'

<P>&nbsp;`Humph!--She'll be a fine catch for somebody.'

<P>&nbsp;`She will so. She's a widow, but quite young yet, and uncommon
handsome fortune of her own, besides, and only one child--and she's nursing
a fine estate for him in ------ There'll be lots to speak for her!--'fraid
there's no chance for uz'--(facetiously jogging me with his elbow, as well
as his companion)--`ha, ha, ha! No offence, sir, I hope?' (to me) `Ahem!--I
should think she'll marry none but a nobleman, myself. Look ye sir,' resumed
he, turning to his other neighbour, and pointing past me with his umbrella,
`that's the Hall--grand park, you see--and all them woods--plenty of timber
there, and lots of game--hallo! what now?'

<P>&nbsp;This exclamation was occasioned by the sudden stoppage of the
coach at the park gates.

<P>&nbsp;`Gen'leman for Staningley Hall?' cried the coachman; and I rose
and threw my carpet-bag on to the ground, preparatory to dropping myself
down after it.

<P>&nbsp;`Sickly, sir?' asked my talkative neighbour, staring me in the
face (I dare say it was white enough).

<P>&nbsp;`No. Here, coachman.'

<P>&nbsp;`Thank'ee, sir.--All right!'

<P>&nbsp;The coachman pocketed his fee and drove away, leaving me not walking
up the park, but pacing to and fro before its gates, with folded arms and
eyes fixed upon the ground--in overwhelming force of images, thoughts,
impressions crowding on my mind, and nothing tangibly distinct but this:--My
love had been cherished in vain; my hope was gone for ever; I must tear
myself away at once, and banish or suppress all thoughts of her like the
remembrance of a wild, mad dream. Gladly would I have lingered round the
place for hours, in the hope of catching, at least one distant glimpse
of her before I went, but it must not be: I must not suffer her to see
me; for what could have brought me hither but the hope of reviving her
attachment, with a view, hereafter to obtain her hand? And could I bear
that she should think me capable of such a thing?--of presuming upon the
acquaintance--the <I>love</I> if you will--accidentally contracted, or
rather forced upon her against her will, when she was an unknown fugitive,
toiling for her own support, apparently without fortune, family or connections--to
come upon her now, when she was re-instated in her proper sphere, and claim
a share in her prosperity, which, had it never failed her, would most certainly
have kept her unknown to me for ever? and this too, when we had parted
sixteen months ago, and she had expressly forbidden me to hope for a re-union
in this world--and never sent me a line or a message from that day to this?
No! The very idea was intolerable.

<P>&nbsp;And even if she should have a lingering affection for me still,
ought I to disturb her peace by awakening those feelings? to subject her
to the struggles of conflicting duty and inclination--to whichsoever side
the latter might allure, or the former imperatively call her--whether she
should deem it her duty to risk the slights and censures of the world,
the sorrow and displeasure of those she loved, for a romantic idea of truth
and constancy to me, or to sacrifice her individual wishes to the feelings
of her friends and her own sense of prudence and the fitness of things?
No--and I would not! I would go at once, and she should never know that
I had approached the place of her abode; for though I might disclaim all
idea of ever aspiring to her hand, or even of soliciting a place in her
friendly regard, her peace should not be broken by my presence, nor her
heart afflicted by the sight of my fidelity.

<P>&nbsp;`Adieu then, dear Helen, for ever!--For ever adieu!'

<P>&nbsp;So said I--and yet I could not tear myself away. I moved a few
paces, and then looked back, for one last view of her stately home, that
I might have its outward form, at least impressed upon my mind as indelibly
as her own image, which alas! I must not see again--then, walked a few
steps farther; and then lost in melancholy musings, paused again and leant
my back against a rough old tree that grew beside the road.
