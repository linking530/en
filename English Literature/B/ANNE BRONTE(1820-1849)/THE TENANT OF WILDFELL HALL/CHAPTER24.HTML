First Quarrel</H3></CENTER>
March 25th.--Arthur is getting tired--not of me, I trust, but of the idle,
quiet life he leads--and no wonder, for he has so few sources of amusement;
he never reads anything but newspapers and sporting magazines; and when
he sees me occupied with a book, he won't let me rest till I close it.
In fine weather he generally manages to get through the time pretty well;
but on rainy days, of which we have had a good many of late, it is quite
painful to witness his ennui. I do all can to amuse him, but it is impossible
to get him to feel interested what I most like to talk about; while, on
the other hand, he likes to talk about things that cannot interest me--or
even that annoy me--and these please him the most of all; for his favourite
amusement is to sit or loll beside me on the sofa and tell me stories of
his former amours, always turning upon the ruin of some confiding girl
or the cozening of some unsuspecting husband; and when I express my horror
and indignation, he lays it all to the charge of jealousy, and laughs till
the tears run down his cheeks. I used to fly into passions or melt into
tears at first, but seeing that his delight increased in proportion to
my anger and agitation, I have since endeavoured to suppress my feelings
and receive his revelations in the silence of calm contempt; but still,
he reads the inward struggle in my face, and misconstrues my bitterness
of soul for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded jealousy; and when
he has sufficiently diverted himself with that, or fears my displeasure
will become too serious for his comfort, be tries to kiss and soothe me
into smiles again--never were his caresses so little welcome as then! <I>This
is double</I> selfishness, displayed to me and to the victims of his former
love. There are times when, with a momentary pang--a flash of wild dismay,
I ask myself, `Helen, what have you done?' But I rebuke the inward questioner,
and repel the obtrusive thoughts that crowd upon me; for, were he ten times
as sensual and impenetrable to good and lofty thoughts, I well know I have
Do right to complain. And I don't and won't complain. I do and will love
him still; and I do not and will not regret that I have linked my fate
with his.

<P>&nbsp;April 4th.--We have had a downright quarrel. `The particulars
are as follows:--Arthur had told me, at different intervals, the whole
story of his intrigue with Lady F--, which I would not believe before.
It was some consolation, however, to find that, in this instance, the lady
had been more to blame than he; for he was very young at the time, and
she had decidedly made the first advances, if what he said was true. I
hated her for it, for it seemed as if she had chiefly contributed to his
corruption, and when he was beginning to talk about her the other day,
I begged he would not mention her, for I detested the very sound of her
name,--

<P>&nbsp;`Not because you loved her, Arthur, mind, but because she injured
you, and deceived her husband, and was altogether a very abominable woman,
whom you ought to be ashamed to mention.'

<P>&nbsp;But he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband,
whom it was impossible to love.

<P>&nbsp;`Then why did she marry him?' said I.

<P>`For his money,' was the reply.

<P>&nbsp;`Then that was another crime, and her solemn promise to love and
honour him was another, that only increased the enormity of the last.'

<P>&nbsp;`You are too severe upon the poor lady,' laughed he. `But never
mind, Helen, I don't care for her now; and I never loved any of them half
as much as I do you; so you needn't fear to be forsaken like them.'

<P>&nbsp;`If you had told me these things before, Arthur, I never should
have given you the chance.'

<P>&nbsp;`<I>Wouldn't</I> you, my darling!'

<P>&nbsp;`Most certainly not!'

<P>&nbsp;He laughed incredulously.

<P>&nbsp;`I wish I could convince you of it now!' cried I, starting up
from beside him; and for the first time in my life, and I hope the last,
I wished I had not married him.

<P>&nbsp;`Helen,' said he, more gravely, `do you know that if I believed
you now, I should be very angry?--but thank Heaven I don't. Though you
stand there with your white face and flashing eyes, looking at me like
a very tigress, I know the heart within you, perhaps a trifle better than
you know it yourself.'

<P>&nbsp;Without another word, I left the room, and locked myself up in
my own chamber. In about half an hour, he came to the door; and first he
tried the handle, then he knocked.

<P>&nbsp;`Won't you let me in, Helen?' said he.

<P>&nbsp;`No; you have displeased me,' I replied, `and I don't want to
see your face or hear your voice again till the morning.'

<P>&nbsp;He paused a moment, as if dumbfoundered or uncertain how to answer
such a speech, and then turned and walked away. This was only an hour after
dinner: I knew he would find it very dull to sit alone all the evening;
and this considerably softened my resentment, though it did not make me
relent. I was determined to show him that my heart was not his slave, and
I could live without him if I chose; and I sat down and wrote a long letter
to my aunt--of course telling her nothing of all this. Soon after ten o'clock,
I heard him come up again; but he passed my door and went straight to his
own dressing-room, where he shut himself in for the fight.

<P>&nbsp;I was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning,
and not a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room with
a careless smile.

<P>&nbsp;`Are you cross still, Helen?' said he, approaching as if to salute
me. I coldly turned to the table, and began to pour out the coffee, observing
that he was rather late.

<P>&nbsp;He uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window, where
he stood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of sullen,
grey clouds, streaming rain, soaking lawn, and dripping, leafless trees--and
muttering execrations on the weather, and then sat down to breakfast. ~e
taking his coffee, he muttered it was `d--d cold.'

<P>&nbsp;`You should not have left it so long,' said I.

<P>&nbsp;He made Do answer, and the meal was concluded in silence. It was
a relief to both when the letter-bag was brought in. It contained, upon
examination, a newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a couple of
letters for me, which he tossed across the table without a remark. One
was from my brother, the other from Milicent Hargrave, who is now in London
with her mother. His, I think, were business letters, and apparently not
much to his mind, for he crushed them into his pocket with some muttered
expletives, that I should have reproved him for at any other time. The
paper, he set before him, and pretended to be deeply absorbed in its contents
during the remainder of breakfast, and a considerable time after.

<P>&nbsp;The reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of
household concerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning; after
lunch, I got my drawing, and from dinner till bedtime, I read. Meanwhile,
poor Arthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy
his time. He wanted to appear as busy and as unconcerned as I did: had
the weather at all permitted, he would doubtless have ordered his horse
and set off to some distant region--no matter where--immediately after
breakfast, and not returned till night; had there been a lady anywhere
within reach, of any age between fifteen and forty-five, he would have
sought revenge and found employment in getting up--or trying to get up--a
desperate flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction, entirely
cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings were truly
deplorable. Ben he had done yawning over his paper and scribbling short
answers to his shorter letters, he spent the remainder of the morning and
the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from room to room, watching
the clouds, cursing the rain, alternately petting, and teasing, and abusing
his dogs, sometimes lounging on the sofa with a book that he could not
force himself to read, and very often fixedly gazing at me, when he thought
I did not perceive it, with the vain hope of detecting some traces of tears,
or some tokens of remorseful anguish in my face. But I managed to preserve
an undisturbed, though grave serenity throughout the day. I was not really
angry: I felt for him all the time, and longed to be reconciled; but I
determined he should make the first advances, or at least show some signs
of an humble and contrite spirit, first; for, if I began, it would only
minister to his self-conceit, increase his arrogance, and quite destroy
the lesson I wanted to give him.

<P>&nbsp;He made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear,
took an unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his tongue;
for when he came in and found me quietly occupied with my book, too busy
to lift my head on his entrance, he merely murmured an expression of suppressed
disapprobation, and, shutting the door with a bang, went and stretched
himself at full length on the sofa, and composed himself to sleep. But
his favourite cocker, Dash, that had been lying at my feet, took the liberty
of jumping upon him and beginning to lick his face. He struck it off with
a smart blow; and the poor dog squeaked, and ran cowering back to me. den
he woke up, about half an hour after, he called it to him again; but Dash
only looked sheepish and wagged the tip of his tail. He called again, more
sharply, but Dash only clung the closer to me, and licked my hand as if
imploring protection. Enraged at this, his master snatched up a heavy book
and hurled it at his head. The poor dog set up a piteous outcry and ran
to the door. I let him out, and then quietly took up the book.

<P>&nbsp;`Give that book to me,' said Arthur,in very courteous tone. I
gave it to him.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why did you let the dog out?' he asked. `You knew I wanted him.'

<P>&nbsp;`By what token?' I replied; `by your throwing the book at him?
but perhaps it was intended for me?'

<P>&nbsp;`No--but I see you've got a taste of it,' said he, looking at
my hand, that had also been struck, and was rather severely grazed.

<P>&nbsp;I returned to my reading; and he endeavoured to occupy himself
in the same manner; but, in a little while, after several portentous yawns,
he pronounced <I>his</I> book to be `cursed trash,' and threw it on to
the table. Then followed eight or ten minutes of silence, during the greater
part of which, I believe, he was staring at me. At last his patience was
tired out.

<P>&nbsp;`What <I>is</I> that book, Helen?' he exclaimed.

<P>I told him.

<P>&nbsp;`Is it interesting?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, very.'

<P>`Humph!'

<P>&nbsp;I went on reading--or pretending to read, at least--I cannot say
there was much communication between my eyes and my brain; for, while the
former ran over the pages, the latter was earnestly wondering when Arthur
would speak next, and what he would say, and what I should answer. But
he did not speak again till I rose to make the tea, and then it was only
to say he should not take any. He continued lounging on the sofa. and alternately
closing his eyes and looking at his watch and at me, till bedtime, when
I rose, and took my candle and retired.

<P>&nbsp;`Helen!' cried he, the moment I had left the room. I turned back,
and stood awaiting his commands.

<P>&nbsp;`What do you want, Arthur?' I said, at length.

<P>`Nothing,' replied he. `Go!'

<P>&nbsp;I went, but hearing him mutter something as I was closing the
door, I turned again. It sounded very like `confounded slut,' but I was
quite willing it should be something else.

<P>&nbsp;`Were you speaking, Arthur?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;`No,' was the answer; and I shut the doom and departed. I saw
nothing more of him till the following morning at breakfast, when he came
down a full hour after the usual time.

<P>&nbsp;`You're very late,' was my morning's salutation.

<P>&nbsp;`You needn't have waited for me,' was his; and he walked up to
the window again. It was just such weather as yesterday.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, this confounded rain!' he muttered. But after studiously
regarding it for a minute or two, a bright idea seemed to strike him, for
he suddenly exclaimed, `But I know what I'll do!' and then returned and
took his seat at the table. The letter.bag was already there, waiting to
be opened. He unlocked it and examined the contents, but said nothing about
them.

<P>&nbsp;`Is,there anything for me?' I asked.

<P>`No.' He opened the newspaper and began to read.

<P>&nbsp;`You'd better take your coffee,' suggested I; `it will be cold
again.'

<P>&nbsp;`You may go,' said he, `if you've done. I don't want you.'

<P>&nbsp;I rose, and withdrew to the next room, wondering if we were to
have another such miserable day as yesterday, and wishing intensely for
an end of these mutually inflicted torments. Shortly after, I heard him
ring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that sounded as if
he meditated a long journey. He then sent for the coachman, and I heard
something about the carriage and the horses, and London, and seven o'clock
to-morrow morning, that startled and disturbed me not a little.

<P>&nbsp;`I must not let him go to London, whatever comes of it,' said
I to myself: `he will run into all kinds of mischief, and I shall be the
cause of it. But the question is, how am I to alter his purpose?--Well,
I will wait awhile, and see if he mentions it.'

<P>&nbsp;I waited most anxiously, from hour to hour; but not a word was
spoken, on that or any other subject, to me. He whistled, and talked to
his dogs, and wandered from room to room, much the same as on the previous
day. At last I began to think I must introduce the subject myself, and
was pondering how to bring it about, when John unwittingly came to my relief
with the following message from the coachman:--

<P>&nbsp;`Please, sir, Richard save one of the horses has got a very bad
cold, and he thinks, sir, if you could make it convenient to go the day
after to-morrow, instead of to-morrow, he could physic it today so as--'

<P>&nbsp;`Confound his impudence!' interjected the master.

<P>&nbsp;`Please, sir, he says it would be a deal better if you could,'
persisted John, `for he hopes there'll be a change in the weather shortly,
and he says it's not <I>likely</I>, when a horse is so bad with a cold,
and physicked and all--'

<P>&nbsp;`Devil take the horse!' cried the gentleman--`Well, tell him I'll
think about it,' he added, after a moment's reflection. He cast a searching
glance at me, as the servant withdrew, expecting to see e token of deep
astonishment and alarm; but, being previously prepared, I preserved an
aspect of stoical indifference. His countenance fell as he met my steady
gaze, and he turned away in very obvious disappointment, and walked up
to the fireplace, where he stood in an attitude of undisguised dejection,
leaning against the chimney-piece with his forehead sunk upon his arm.

<P>`Where do you want to go, Arthur?' said I.

<P>`To London,' replied he, gravely.

<P>`What for?' I asked.

<P>`Because I cannot be happy here.'

<P>`Why not?'

<P>`Because my wife doesn't love me.'

<P>`She would love you with all her heart, if you deserved it.'

<P>`What must I do to deserve it?'

<P>This seemed humble and earnest enough; and I was so much affected, between
sorrow and joy, that I was obliged to pause a few seconds before I could
steady my voice to reply.

<P>&nbsp;`if she gives you her heart,' said I, `you must take it thankfully,
and use it well, and not pull it in pieces, and laugh in her face, because
she cannot snatch it away.'

<P>&nbsp;He now turned round and stood faring me, with his back to the
fire.

<P>&nbsp;`Come then, Helen, are you going to be a good girl?' said he.

<P>&nbsp;This sounded rather too arrogant, and the smile that accompanied
it did not please me. I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former
answer had implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might have
seen me brush away a tear.

<P>&nbsp;`Are you going to forgive me, Helen?' he resumed, more humbly.

<P>&nbsp;`Are <I>you</I> penitent?' I replied, stepping up to him and smiling
in his face.

<P>&nbsp;`Heart-broken!' he answered, with a rueful countenance--yet with
a merry smile just lurking within his eyes and about the corners of his
mouth; but this could not repulse me, and I flew into his arms. He fervently
embraced me and though I shed a torrent of tears, I think I never was happier
in my life than at that moment.

<P>&nbsp;`Then you won't go to London, Arthur?' I said, when the first
transport of tears and kisses had subsided.

<P>&nbsp;`No, love,--unless you will go with me.'

<P>&nbsp;`I will, gladly,' I answered, `if you think the change will amuse
you, and if you will put off the journey till next week.'

<P>&nbsp;He readily consented, but said there was no need of much preparation,
as he should not be staying for long, for he did not wish me to be Londonized,
and to lose my country freshness and originality by too much intercourse
with the ladies of the world. I thought this folly; but I did not wish
to contradict him now: I merely said that I was of very domestic habits,
as he well knew, and had no particular wish to mingle with the world.

<P>&nbsp;So we are to go to London on Monday, the day after to-morrow.
It is now four days since the termination of our quarrel, and I'm sure
it has done us both good: it has made me like Arthur a great deal better
and made him behave a great deal better to me. He has never once attempted
to annoy me, since, by the most distant allusion to Lady F--or any of those
disagreeable reminiscences of his former life--I wish I could blot them
from my memory, or else get him to regard such matters in the same light
as I do. Well! it is something, however, to have made him see that they
are not fit subjects for a conjugal jest. He may see farther sometime--I
will put no limits to my hopes; and, in spite of my aunt's forebodings
and my own unspoken fears, I trust we shall be happy yet.
