AN UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE</H3></CENTER>
We will now turn to a certain still, cold, cloudy afternoon about the commencement
of December, when the first fall of snow lay thinly scattered over the
blighted fields and frozen roads, or stored more thickly in the hollows
of the deep cart ruts and footsteps of men and horses, impressed in the
now petrified mire of last month's drenching rains. I remember it well,
for I was walking home from the vicarage, with no less remarkable a personage
than Miss Eliza Millward by my side. I had been to call upon her iather,--a
sacrifice to civility undertaken entirely to please my mother, not myself,
for I hated to go near the house; not merely on account of my antipathy
to the once so bewitching Eliza, but because I had not half forgiven the
old gentleman himself for his ill opinion of Mrs. Huntingdon; for though
now constrained to acknowledge himself mistaken in his former judgment,
he still maintained that she had done wrong to leave her husband; it was
a violation of her sacred duties as a wife, and a tempting of Providence
by laying herself open to temptation; and nothing short of bodily ill-usage
(and that of no trifling nature) could excuse such a step--or even that,
for in such a case she ought to appeal to the laws for protection. But
it was not of him I intended to speak; it was of his daughter Eliza. Just
as I was taking leave of the vicar, she entered the room, ready equipped
for a walk.

<P>&nbsp;`I was just coming to see your sister, Mr. Markham,' said she;
`and so if you have no objection, I'll accompany you home. I like company
when I'm walking out--don't you?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, when it's agreeable.'

<P>&nbsp;`That of course,' rejoined the young lady, smiling archly. So
we proceeded together.

<P>&nbsp;`Shall I find Rose at home, do you think?' said she, as we closed
the garden gate, and set our faces towards Lirden-car.

<P>&nbsp;`I believe so.'

<P>&nbsp;`I trust I shall, for I've a little bit of news for her--if you
haven't forestalled me.'

<P>&nbsp;`I?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes: do you know what Mr. Lawrence is gone for?' She looked up
anxiously for my reply.

<P>&nbsp;`<I>Is</I> he gone?' said I, and her face brightened.

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! then he hasn't told you about his sister?'

<P>&nbsp;`What of <I>her</I>?' I demanded, in terror lest some evil should
have befallen her.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, Mr. Markham, how you blush!' cried she with a tormenting
laugh. `Ha, ha, you have not forgotten her yet! But you had better be quick
about it, I can tell you, for alas, alas!--she's going to be married next
Thursday!'

<P>&nbsp;`No, Miss Eliza! that's false.'

<P>&nbsp;`Do you charge me with a falsehood, sir?'

<P>&nbsp;`You are misinformed.'

<P>&nbsp;`Am I? Do you know better then?'

<P>&nbsp;`I think I do.'

<P>&nbsp;`What makes you look so pale then?' said she, smiling with delight
at my emotion. `Is it anger at poor me for telling such a fib? Well, I
only "tell the tale as 'twas told to me:" I don't vouch for the truth of
it; but at the same time, I don't see what reason Sarah should have for
deceiving me, or her informant for deceiving her; and that was what she
told me the footman told her:--that Mrs. Huntingdon was going to be married
on Thursday, and Mr. Lawrence was gone to the wedding. She did tell me
the name of the gentleman, but I've forgotten that. Perhaps you can assist
me to remember it. Is there not some one that lives near--or frequently
visits the neighbourhood, that has long been attached to her? a Mr.--oh
dear!--Mr.--'

<P>&nbsp;`Hargrave?' suggested I, with a bitter smile.

<P>&nbsp;`You're right!' cried she, `that was the very name.'

<P>&nbsp;`Impossible, Miss Eliza!' I exclaimed in a tone that made her
start.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, you know, that's what they told me,' said she, composedly
staring me in the face. And then she broke out into a long shrill laugh
that put me to my wits' end with fury.

<P>&nbsp;`Really, you must excuse me,' cried she: `I know it's very rude,
but ha, ha, ha!--Did you think to marry her yourself? Dear, dear, what
a pity! ha, ha, ha!--Gracious, Mr. Markham! are you going to faint? O mercy!
shall I call this man? Here, Jacob--' But checking the word on her lips,
I seized her arm and gave it, I think, a pretty severe squeeze, for she
shrank into herself with a faint cry of pain or terror; but the spirit
within her was not subdued: instantly rallying, she continued, with well
feigned concern--

<P>&nbsp;`What can I do for you? Will you have some water--some brandy?--I
dare say they have some in the public-house down there, if you'll let me
run.'

<P>&nbsp;`Have done with this nonsense!' cried I sternly. She looked confounded--almost
frightened again, for a moment. `You know I hate such jests,' I continued.

<P>&nbsp;`<I>Jests</I> indeed! I wasn't <I>jesting</I>!'

<P>&nbsp;`You were laughing, at all events; and I don't like to be laughed
at,' returned I, making violent efforts to speak with proper dignity and
composure, and to say nothing but what was coherent and sensible. `And
since you are in such a merry mood, Miss Eliza, you must be good enough
company for yourself, and therefore I shall leave you to finish your walk
alone--for, now I think of it, I have business elsewhere; so good evening.'

<P>&nbsp;With that I left her (smothering her malicious laughter) and turned
aside into the fields, springing up the bank, and pushing through the nearest
gap in the hedge. Determined at once to prove the truth--or rather the
falsehood of her story, I hastened to Woodford as fast as my legs could
carry me--first, veering round by a circuitous course, but the moment I
was out of sight of my fair tormentor, cutting away across the country,
just as a bird might fly--over pastureland and fallow, and stubble, and
lane--clearing hedges and ditches, and hurdles, till I came to the young
squire's gates. Never till now had I known the full fervour of my love--the
full strength of my hopes, not wholly crushed even in my hours of deepest
despondency, always tenaciously clinging to the thought that one day she
might be mine--or if not that, at least that something of my memory, some
slight remembrance of our friendship and our love would be for ever cherished
in her heart. I marched up to the door, determined if I saw the master,
to question him boldly concerning his sister, to wait and hesitate no longer,
but cast false delicacy and stupid pride behind my back, and know my fate
at once.

<P>&nbsp;`Is Mr. Lawrence at home?' I eagerly asked of the servant that
opened the door.

<P>&nbsp;`No sir, master went yesterday,' replied he, looking very alert.

<P>&nbsp;`Went where?'

<P>&nbsp;`To Grassdale, sir--wasn't you aware, sir? He's very close, is
master,' said the fellow with a foolish, simpering grin. `I suppose, sir--'

<P>&nbsp;But I turned and left him, without waiting to hear what he supposed.
I was not going to stand there to expose my tortured feelings to the insolent
laughter and impertinent curiosity of a fellow like that.

<P>&nbsp;But what was to be done now? Could it be possible that she had
left me for <I>that</I> man? I could not believe it. Me she might forsake,
but <I>not</I> to give herself to him! Well, I would know the truth--to
no concerns of daily life could I attend; while this tempest of doubt and
dread, of jealousy and rage distracted me. I would take the morning coach
from L--- (the evening one would be already gone), and fly to Grassdale,
I <I>must</I> be there before the marriage. And why? Because a thought
struck me, that <I>perhaps</I> I might prevent it--that if I did not, she
and I might both lament it to the latest moment of our lives. It struck
me that some one might have belied me to her: perhaps her brother--yes,
no doubt her brother had persuaded her that I was false and faithless,
and taking advantage of her natural indignation, and perhaps her desponding
carelessness about her future life, had urged her, artfully, cruelly on,
to this other marriage in order to secure her from me. If this <I>was</I>
the case, and if she should only discover her mistake when too late to
repair it--to what a life of misery and vain regret might she be doomed
as well as me! and what remorse for me, to think my foolish scruples had
induced it all! Oh, I <I>must</I> see her--she must know my truth even
if I told it at the church door! I might pass for a madman or an impertinent
fool--even she might be offended at such an interruption, or at least might
tell me it was now too lat--but if I <I>could</I> save her! if she <I>might</I>
be mint was too rapturous a thought!

<P>&nbsp;Winged by this hope, and goaded by these fears, I hurried homewards
to prepare for my departure on the morrow. I told my mother that urgent
business which admitted no delay, but which I could not then explain, called
me away to (the last large town through which I had to pass). My deep anxiety
and serious preoccupation, could not be concealed from her maternal eyes;
and I had much ado to calm her apprehensions of some disastrous mystery.

<P>&nbsp;That night there came a heavy fall of snow, which so retarded
the progress of the coaches on the following day, that I was almost driven
to distraction. I travelled all night of course, for this was Wednesday:
tomorrow morning, doubtless, the marriage would take place. But the night
was long and dark; the snow heavily clogged the wheels and balled the horses'
feet; the animals were consumedly lazy, the coachmen most execrably cautious,
the passengers confoundedly apathetic in their supine indifference to the
rate of our progression. Instead of assisting me to bully the several coachmen
and urge them forward, they merely stared and grinned at my impatience:
one fellow even ventured to rally me upon it--but I silenced him with a
look that quelled him for the rest of the journey;--and when, at the last
stage, I would have taken the reins into my own hand, they all with one
accord opposed it.

<P>&nbsp;It was broad daylight when we entered M--- and drew up at the
Rose and Crown. I alighted and called aloud for a postchaise to Grassdale.
There was none to be had: the only one in the town was under repair. `A
gig then---fly--car--anything--only be quick!' There was a gig but not
a horse to spare. I sent into the town to seek one; but they were such
an intolerable time about it that I could wait no longer: I thought my
own feet would carry me sooner, and bidding them send the confounded conveyance
after me, if it were ready within an hour, I set off as fast as I could
walk. The distance was little more than six miles, but the road was strange,
and I had to keep stopping to enquire my way--hallooing to carters and
clod-hoppers, and frequently invading the cottages, for there were few
abroad that winter's morning,--sometimes knocking up the lazy people from
their beds, for where so little work was to be done--perhaps so little
food and fire to be had, they cared not to curtail their slumbers. I had
no time to think of <I>them</I>, however: aching with weariness and desperation,
I hurried on. The gig did not overtake me: it was well I had not waited
for it--vexatious rather, that I had been fool enough to wait so long.

<P>&nbsp;At length however, I entered the neighbourhood of Grassdale. I
approached the little rural church--but lo! there stood a train of carriages
before it--it needed not the white favours bedecking the servants and horses,
nor the merry voices of the village idlers assembled to witness the show,
to apprize me that there was a wedding within. I ran in among them', demanding,
with breathless eagerness, had the ceremony long commenced? They only gaped
and stared. In my desperation I pushed past them, and was about to enter
the church-yard gate, when a group of ragged urchins, that had been hanging
like bees to the windows, suddenly dropped off and made a rush for the
porch, vociferating in the uncouth dialect of their county, something which
signified, `It's over--they're coming out!'

<P>&nbsp;If Eliza Millward had seen me then, she might indeed have been
delighted. I grasped the gate-post for support, and stood intently gazing
towards the door to take my last look on my soul's delight, my first on
that detested mortal who had torn her from my heart, and doomed her, I
was certain, to a life of misery and hollow, vain repining--for what happiness
could she enjoy with him? I did not wish to shock her with my presence
now, but I had not power to move away. Forth came the bride and bridegroom.
Him I saw not; I had eyes for none but her. A long veil shrouded half her
graceful form, but did not hide it; I could see that while she carried
her head erect, her eyes were bent upon the ground, and her face and neck
were suffused with a crimson blush; but every feature was radiant with
smiles, and, gleaming through the misty whiteness of her veil, were clusters
of golden ringlets! O Heavens! it was <I>not</I> my Helen! The first glimpse
made me start--but my eyes were darkened with exhaustion and despair--dare
I trust them? Yes--it <I>is</I> not she! It was a younger, slighter, rosier
beauty--lovely, indeed, but with far less dignity and depth of soul--without
that indefinable grace, that keenly <I>spirituel</I> yet gentle charm,
that ineffable power to attract and subjugate the heart--my heart at least.
I looked at the bridegroom--it was Frederick Lawrence! I wiped away the
cold drops that were trickling down my forehead, and stepped back as he
approached; but his eye fell upon me, and he knew me, altered as my appearance
must have been.

<P>&nbsp;`Is that you Markham?' said he, startled and confounded at the
apparition--perhaps, too, at the wildness of my looks.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, Lawrence--is that you?' I mustered the presence of mind
to reply.

<P>&nbsp;He smiled and coloured, as if half-proud and half-ashamed of his
identity; and if he had reason to be proud of the sweet lady on his arm,
he had no less cause to be ashamed of having concealed his good fortune
so long.

<P>&nbsp;`Allow me to introduce you to my bride,' said he, endeavouring
to hide his embarrassment by an assumption of careless gaiety. `Esther,
this is Mr. Markham, my friend Markham, Mrs. Lawrence, late Miss Hargrave.'

<P>&nbsp;I bowed to the bride, and vehemently wrung the bridegroom's hand.

<P>&nbsp;`Why did you not tell me of this?' I said reproachfully, pretending
a resentment I did not feel (for in truth I was almost wild with joy to
find myself so happily mistaken, and overflowing with affection to him
for this and for the base injustice I felt that I had done him in my mind--he
might have wronged me, but not to <I>that</I> extent; and as I had hated
him like a demon for the last forty hours, the reaction from such a feeling
was so great that I could pardon all offences for the moment--and love
him in spite of them too).

<P>&nbsp;`I <I>did tell</I> you,' said he, with an air of guilty confusion,
`you received my letter?'

<P>&nbsp;`What letter?'

<P>&nbsp;`The one announcing my intended marriage.'

<P>&nbsp;`I never received the most distant hint of such an intention.'

<P>&nbsp;`It must have crossed you on your way then--it should have reached
you yesterday morning--it was rather late, I acknowledge. But what brought
you here then, if you received no information?'

<P>&nbsp;It was now <I>my</I> turn to be confounded; but the young lady,
who had been busily patting the snow with her foot during our short, sotto
voce colloquy, very opportunely came to my assistance by pinching her companion's
arm and whispering a suggestion that his friend should be invited to step
into the carriage and go with them; it being scarcely agreeable to stand
there among so many gazers, and keeping their friends waiting, into the
bargain.

<P>&nbsp;`And so cold as it is too!' said he, glancing with dismay at her
slight drapery, and immediately handing her into the carriage. `Markham,
will you come? We are going to Paris, but we can drop you anywhere between
this and Dover.'

<P>&nbsp;`No thank you. Good bye--I needn't wish you a pleasant journey;
but I shall expect a very handsome apology, some time, mind, and scores
of letters, before we meet again.'

<P>&nbsp;He shook my hand and hastened to take his place beside his lady.
This was no time or place for explanation or discourse: we had already
stood long enough to excite the wonder of the village sightseers, and perhaps
the wrath of the attendant bridal party; though, of course, all this passed
in a much shorter time than I have taken to relate or even than you will
take to read it. I stood beside the carriage, and, the window being down,
I saw my happy friend fondly encircle his companion's waist with his arm,
while she rested her glowing cheek on his shoulder, looking the very impersonation'
of loving, trusting bliss. In the interval between the footman's closing
the door and taking his place behind, she raised her smiling brown eyes
to his face, observing playfully--

<P>&nbsp;`I fear you must think me very insensible, Frederick: I know it
is the custom for ladies to cry on these occasions, but I couldn't squeeze
a tear for my life.'

<P>&nbsp;He only answered with a kiss, and pressed her still closer to
his bosom.

<P>&nbsp;`But what is this?' he murmured. `Why, Esther, you're crying now!'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, it's nothing--it's only too much happiness--and the wish,'
sobbed she, `that our dear Helen were as happy as ourselves.'

<P>&nbsp;`Bless you for that wish!' I inwardly responded as the carriage
rolled away--`and Heaven grant it be not wholly vain!'

<P>&nbsp;I thought a cloud had suddenly darkened her husband's face as
she spoke. What did <I>he</I> think? Could he grudge such happiness to
his dear sister and his friend as he now felt himself? At <I>such</I> a
moment it was impossible. The contrast between her fate and his <I>must</I>
darken his bliss for a time. Perhaps too he thought of me: perhaps he regretted
the part he had had in preventing our union, by omitting to help us, if
not by actually plotting against us--I exonerated him from <I>that</I>
charge, now, and deeply lamented my former ungenerous suspicions; but he
<I>had</I> wronged us, still--I hoped, I trusted that he had. He had not
attempted to check the course of our love by actually damming up the streams
in their passage, but he had passively watched the two currents wandering
through life's arid wilderness, declining to clear away the obstructions
that divided them, and secretly hoping that both would lose themselves
in the sand before they could be joined in one. And meantime, he had been
quietly proceeding with his own affairs: perhaps his heart and head had
been so full of his fair lady that he had had but little thought to spare
for others. Doubtless he had made his first acquaintance with her--his
first intimate acquaintance at least--during his three months' sojourn
at F , for I now recollected that he had once casually let fall an intimation
that his aunt and sister had a young friend staying with them at the time,
and this accounted for at least one half his silence about all transactions
there. Now too I saw a reason for many little things that had slightly
puzzled me before; among the rest, for sundry departures from Woodford,
and absences more or less prolonged, for which he never satisfactorily
accounted, and concerning which he hated to be questioned on his return.
Well might the servant say his master was `very close.' But why this strange
reserve to <I>me?</I> Partly, from that remarkable idiosyncrasy to which
I have before alluded; partly, perhaps, from tenderness to my feelings,
or fear to disturb my philosophy by touching upon the infectious theme
of love.
