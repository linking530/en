SOCIAL VIRTUES</H3></CENTER>
March 20th, 1824. The dreaded time is come, and Arthur is gone, as I expected.
This time he announced it his intention to make but a short stay in London,
and pass over to the continent, where he should probably stay a few weeks;
but I shall not expect him till after the lapse of many weeks: I now know
that, with him, days signify weeks, and weeks months.

<P>&nbsp;I was to have accompanied him, but, a little before the time arranged
for our departure, he allowed--and even urged me, with an appearance of
wonderful self-sacrifice, to go and see my unfortunate father, who is very
ill, and my brother, who is very unhappy in consequence of both the illness
and its cause, and whom I had not seen since the day our child was christened,
when he stood sponsor along with Mr. Hargrave and my aunt. Not willing
to impose upon my husband's good-nature in thus allowing me to leave him,
I made but a very short stay; but when I returned to Grassdale--he was
gone.

<P>&nbsp;He left a note to explain his so hasty departure, pretending that
some sudden emergency had demanded his immediate presence in London, and
rendered it impossible to await my return; adding that I had better not
trouble myself to follow him, as he intended to make such a short stay,
that it would hardly be worth while; and as, of course, he could travel
alone at less than half the expense than if I accompanied him, it would
perhaps be better to defer the excursion to another year, when he should
have got our affairs into a rather more settled state, as he was now endeavouring
to do.

<P>&nbsp;Was it really so?--or was the whole a contrivance to ensure his
going forth upon his pleasure-seeking excursion, without my presence to
restrain him? It is painful to doubt the sincerity of those we love, but
after so many proofs of falsity and utter disregard to principle how can
I believe so improbable a story?

<P>&nbsp;I have this one source of consolation left:--he had told me some
time previously, that if ever he went to London or Paris again, he should
observe more moderation in his indulgences than before, lest he should
destroy his capacity for enjoyment altogether: he had no ambition to live
to a prodigious old age, but he should like to have his share of life,
and above all, to relish its pleasures to the last--to which end, he found
it necessary to economize, for already, he feared, he was not so handsome
a fellow as he had been, and young as he was, he had lately detected some
grey hairs among his beloved chestnut locks; he suspected he was getting
a trifle fatter too, than was quite desirable--but that was with good living
and idleness; and for the rest, he trusted he was as strong and hearty
as ever: only there was no saying what <I>another</I> such a season of
unlimited madness and devilment, as the last, might not do towards bringing
him down. Yes; he said this to me--with unblushing effrontery, and that
same blythe, roguish twinkle of the eyes I once so loved to see, and that
low, joyous laugh it used to warm my heart to hear.

<P>&nbsp;Well! such considerations will doubtless have more weight with
him than any that I could urge. We shall see what <I>they</I> can do towards
his preservation, since no better hope remains.

<P>&nbsp;July 30th.--He returned about three weeks ago, rather better in
health, certainly, than before, but still worse in temper. And yet, perhaps,
I am wrong: it is <I>I</I> that am less patient and forbearing. I am tired
out with his injustice, his selfishness and hopeless <I>depravity</I>--I
wish a milder word would do--; I am no angel and my corruption rises against
it. My poor father died last week: Arthur was vexed to hear of it, because
he saw that I was shocked and grieved, and he feared the circumstance would
mar his comfort. When I spoke of ordering my mourning, he exclaimed--

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, I hate black! But however, I suppose you must wear it awhile,
for form's sake; but I hope, Helen, you won't think it your bounden duty
to compose your face and manners into conformity with your funereal garb.
Why should you sigh and groan, and I be made uncomfortable because an old
gentleman in ---hire, a perfect stranger to us both, has thought proper
to drink himself to death?--There now, I declare you're crying! Well, it
must be affectation.'

<P>&nbsp;He would not hear of my attending the funeral, or going for a
day or two, to cheer poor Frederick's solitude. It was quite unnecessary,
he said, and I was unreasonable to wish it. What was my father to me? I
had never seen him, but once since I was a baby, and I well knew he had
never cared a stiver about me;--and my brother too, was little better than
a stranger. `Besides, dear Helen,' said he, embracing me with flattering
fondness, `I cannot spare you for a single day.'

<P>&nbsp;`Then how have you managed without me, these <I>many</I> days?'
said I.

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! then I was knocking about the world, now I am at home; and
home without you, my household deity, would be intolerable.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, as long as I am necessary to your comfort; but you did not
say so before, when you urged me to leave you, in order that you might
get away from your home without me,' retorted I; but before the words were
well out of my mouth, I regretted having uttered them. It seemed so heavy
a charge: if false, too gross an insult; if true, too humiliating a fact
to be thus openly cast in his teeth. But I might have spared myself that
momentary pang of self-reproach. The accusation awoke neither shame nor
indignation in him: he attempted neither denial nor excuse, but only answered
with a long, low, chuckling laugh as if he viewed the whole transaction
as a clever, merry jest from beginning to end. Surely that man will make
me dislike him at last!

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>`Sine as ye brew, my maiden fair,</CENTER>

<CENTER>Keep mind that ye maun drink the yill."</CENTER>


<P>Yes; and I <I>will</I> drink it to the very dregs: and none but myself
shall know how bitter I find it!

<P>&nbsp;August 20th.--We are shaken down again to about our usual position.
Arthur has returned to nearly his former condition and habits; and I have
found it my wisest plan to shut my eyes against the past and future, as
far as <I>he</I> at least is concerned, and live only for the present;
to love him when I can; to smile (if possible) when he smiles, be cheerful
when he is cheerful, and pleased when he is agreeable; and when he is not,
to try to make him so--and if that won't answer, to bear with him, to excuse
him, and forgive him, as well as I can, and restrain my own evil passions
from aggravating his; and yet, while I thus yield and minister to his more
harmless propensities to self-indulgence, to do all in my power to save
him from the worse.

<P>&nbsp;But we shall not be long alone together. I shall shortly be called
upon to entertain the same select body of friends as we had the autumn
before last, with the addition of Mr. Hattersley and, at my special request,
his wife and child. I long to see Milicent--and her little girl too. The
latter is now above a year old; she will be a charming playmate for my
little Arthur.

<P>&nbsp;September 30th.--Our guests have been here a week or two; but
I have had no leisure to pass any comments upon them till now. I cannot
get over my dislike to Lady Lowborough. It is not founded on mere personal
pique; it is the woman herself that I dislike, because I so thoroughly
disapprove of her. I always avoid her company as much as I can without
violating the laws of hospitality; but when we do speak or converse together,
it is with the utmost civility--even apparent cordiality on her part; but
preserve me from such cordiality! It is like handling briar-roses and may-blossoms--bright
enough to the eye, and outwardly soft to the touch, but you know there
are thorns beneath, and every now and then you feel them too; and perhaps
resent the injury by crushing them in till you have destroyed their power,
though somewhat to the detriment of your own fingers.

<P>&nbsp;Of late, however, I have seen nothing in her conduct towards Arthur
to anger or alarm me. During the first few days I thought she seemed very
solicitous to win his admiration. Her efforts were not unnoticed by him:
I frequently saw him smiling to himself at her artful manoeuvres: but,
to his praise be it spoken, her shafts fell powerless by his side. Her
most bewitching smiles, her haughtiest frowns were ever received with the
same immutable, careless good-humour; till, finding he was indeed impenetrable,
she suddenly remitted her efforts, and became, to all appearance, as perfectly
indifferent as himself. Nor have I since witnessed any symptom of pique
on his part, or renewed attempts at conquest upon hers.

<P>&nbsp;This is as it should be; but Arthur never will let me be satisfied
with him. I have never, for a single hour since I married him, known what
it is to realize that sweet idea, `In quietness and confidence shall be
your rest.' Those two detestable men Grimsby and Hattersley have destroyed
all my labour against his love of wine. They encourage him daily to overstep
the bounds of moderation, and, not unfrequently, to disgrace himself by
positive excess. I shall not soon forget the second night after their arrival.
Just as I had retired from the dining-room, with the ladies, before the
door was closed upon us, Arthur exclaimed--

<P>&nbsp;`Now then, my lads, what say you to a regular jollification?'

<P>&nbsp;Milicent glanced at me with a half reproachful look, as if <I>I</I>
could hinder it; but her countenance changed when she heard Hattersley's
voice shouting through door and wall:

<P>&nbsp;`<I>I'm</I> your man! Send for more wine: here isn't <I>half</I>
enough!'

<P>&nbsp;We had scarcely entered the drawing-room before we were joined
by Lord Lowborough.

<P>&nbsp;`What <I>can</I> induce you to come so soon?' exclaimed his lady,
with a most ungracious air of dissatisfaction.

<P>&nbsp;`You know I never drink, Annabella,' replied he, seriously.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, but you might stay with them a little: it looks so silly
to be always dangling after the women--I wonder you can!'

<P>&nbsp;He reproached her with a look of mingled bitterness and surprise,
and sinking into a chair, suppressed a heavy sigh, bit his pale lips, and
fixed his eyes upon the floor.

<P>&nbsp;`You did right to leave them, Lord Lowborough,' said I. `I trust
you will always continue to honour us so early with your company. And if
Annabella knew the value of true wisdom, and the misery of folly and--and
intemperance, she would not talk such nonsense--even in jest.'

<P>&nbsp;He raised his eyes while I spoke, and gravely turned them upon
me with a half surprised, half abstracted look, and then bent them on his
wife.

<P>&nbsp;`At least,' said she, `I know the value of a warm heart and a
bold, manly spirit!'

<P>&nbsp;And she pointed her words with a glance of triumph at me, which
seemed to say, `And that is more than <I>you</I> do,' and a look of scorn
at her husband, that entered into his soul. I was intensely exasperated;
but it was not for me to reprove her, or, as it seemed, to express my sympathy
with her husband without insulting his feelings. All I could do, to obey
my inward impulse, was to hand him a cup of coffee, bringing it to him
myself, and before I served either of the ladies, by way of balancing her
contempt by my exceeding deference. He took it mechanically from my hand,
with a slight inclination, and, next minute, rose and placed it untasted
on the table, looking, not at it, but at her.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, Annabella,' said he, in a deep and hollow tone, `since
my presence is disagreeable to you, I will relieve you of it.'

<P>&nbsp;`Are you going back to them, then?' said she, carelessly.

<P>&nbsp;`No,' exclaimed he, with harsh and startling emphasis; `I will
NOT go back to them! And I will never stay with them one moment longer
than I think right, for you or any other tempter! But you needn't mind
that I shall never trouble you again, by intruding my company upon you
so unseasonably.'

<P>&nbsp;He left the room, I heard the hall door open and shut, and immediately
after, on putting aside the curtain, I saw him pacing down the park, in
the comfortless gloom of the damp, cloudy twilight.

<P>&nbsp;Such scenes as this are always disagreeable to witness. Our little
party was completely silenced for a moment. Milicent played with her teaspoon,
and looked confounded and uncomfortable. If Annabella felt any shame or
uneasiness, she attempted to hide it by a short, reckless laugh, and calmly
betook herself to her coffee.

<P>&nbsp;`It would serve you right, Annabella,' said I at length, `if Lord
Lowborough were to return to his old habits, which had so nearly effected
his ruin, and which it cost him such an effort to break. You would then
see cause to repent such conduct as this.'

<P>&nbsp;`Not at all, my dear! I should not mind if his Lordship were to
see fit to intoxicate himself every day: I should only the sooner be rid
of him.'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, Annabella!' cried Milicent. `How <I>can</I> you say such
wicked things! It would indeed be a just punishment, as far as you are
concerned, if Providence should take you at your word, and make you feel
what others feel that--' She paused as a sudden burst of loud talking and
laughter reached us from the dining room, in which the voice of Hattersley
was pre-eminently conspicuous, even to my unpractised ear.

<P>&nbsp;`What <I>you</I> feel at this moment, I suppose?' said Lady Lowborough,
with a malicious smile, fixing her eyes upon her cousin's distressed countenance.

<P>&nbsp;The latter offered no reply, but averted her face and brushed
away a tear. At that moment the door opened and admitted Mr. Hargrave;
just a little flushed, his dark eyes sparkling with unwonted vivacity.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, I'm glad you're come, Walter!' cried his sister-- `But I
wish you could have got Ralph to come too.'

<P>&nbsp;`Utterly impossible, dear Milicent,' replied he, gaily. `I had
much ado to get away myself. Ralph attempted to keep me by violence; Huntingdon
threatened me with the eternal loss of his friendship; and Grimsby, worse
than all, endeavoured to make me ashamed of my virtue, by such galling
sarcasms and innuendos as he knew would wound me the most. So you see,
ladies, you ought to make me welcome when I have braved and suffered so
much for the favour of your sweet society.' He smilingly turned to me and
bowed as he finished the sentence.

<P>&nbsp;`Isn't he <I>handsome</I> now Helen?' whispered Milicent, her
sisterly pride overcoming, for the moment, all other considerations.

<P>&nbsp;`He would be,' I returned, `if that brilliance of eye, and lip,
and cheek were natural to him; but look again, a few hours hence.'

<P>&nbsp;Here the gentleman took a seat near me at the table, and petitioned
for a cup of coffee.

<P>&nbsp;`I consider this an apt illustration of Heaven taken by storm,'
said he, as I handed one to him. `I am in paradise now; but I have fought
my way through flood and fire to win it. Ralph Hattersley's last resource
was to set his back against the door, and swear I should find no passage
but through his body (a pretty substantial one too). Happily, however,
that was not the only door, and I effected my escape by the side entrance,
through the butler's pantry, to the infinite amazement of Benson, who was
cleaning the plate.'

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Hargrave laughed, and so did his cousin; but his sister and
I remained silent and grave.

<P>&nbsp;`Pardon my levity, Mrs. Huntingdon,' murmured he, more seriously,
as he raised his eyes to my face. `You are not used to these things: you
suffer them to affect your delicate mind too sensibly. But I thought of
you in the midst of those lawless roisterers; and I endeavoured to persuade
Mr. Huntingdon to think of you too; but to no purpose: I fear he is fully
determined to enjoy himself this night; and it will be no use keeping the
coffee waiting for him or his companions: it will be much if they join
us at tea. Meantime, I earnestly wish I could banish the thoughts of them
from your mind--and my own too, for I hate to think of them--yes--even
of my dear friend Huntingdon, when I consider the power he possesses over
the happiness of one so immeasurably superior to himself, and the use he
makes of it--I positively <I>detest</I> the man!'

<P>&nbsp;`You had better not say so to me, then,' said I; `for, bad as
he is, he is part of myself,' and you cannot abuse him without offending
me.'

<P>&nbsp;`Pardon me, then, for I would sooner die than offend you.--But
let us say no more of him for the present if you please.'

<P>&nbsp;He then entirely changed the subject of discourse, and exerting
all his powers to entertain our little circle, conversed on different topics
with more than his usual brilliance and fluency, addressing himself, sometimes,
exclusively to me, sometimes to the whole trio of ladies. Annabella cheerfully
bore her part in the conversation; but I was sick at heart,--especially
when loud bursts of laughter and incoherent songs, pealing through the
triple doors of hall and ante-room, startled my ear and pierced my aching
temples;--and Milicent partly shared my feelings; so that, to us, the evening
appeared a very long one, in spite of Hargrave's apparently good-natured
exertions to give it a contrary effect.

<P>&nbsp;At last, they came; but not till after ten, when tea, which had
been delayed for more than half an hour, was nearly over. Much as I had
longed for their coming, my heart failed me at the riotous uproar of their
approach; and Milicent turned pale and almost started from her seat as
Mr. Hattersley burst into the room with a clamorous volley of oaths in
his mouth, which Hargrave endeavoured to check by entreating him to remember
the ladies.

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! you do well to remind me of the ladies, you dastardly deserter,'
cried he, shaking his formidable fist at his brother-in-law; `if it were
not for them, you well know, I'd demolish you in the twinkling of an eye,
and give your body to the fowls of Heaven and the lilies of the field!"
Then, planting a chair by Lady Lowborough's side, he stationed himself
in it, and began to talk to her, with a mixture of absurdity and rascally
impudence that seemed rather to amuse than to offend her; though she affected
to resent his insolence, and to keep him at bay with sallies of smart and
spirited repartee.

<P>&nbsp;Meantime, Mr. Grimsby seated himself by me, in the chair vacated
by Hargrave as they entered, and gravely stated that he would thank me
for a cup of tea: and Arthur placed himself beside poor Milicent, confidentially
pushing his head into her face, and drawing in closer to her as she shrunk
away from him. He was not so noisy as Hattersley, but his face was exceedingly
flushed, he laughed incessantly, and while I blushed for all I saw and
heard of him, I was glad that he chose to talk to his companion in so low
a tone that no one could hear what he said but herself. It must have been
intolerable nonsense at best, for she looked excessively annoyed, and first
went red in the face, then indignantly pushed back her chair, and finally
took refuge behind me on the sofa. Arthur's sole intention seemed to have
been to produce some such disagreeable effects: he laughed immoderately
on finding he had driven her away--drawing in his chair to the table, he
leant his folded arms upon it, and delivered himself up to a paroxysm of
weak, low, foolish laughter. When he was tired of this exercise he lifted
his head and called aloud to Hattersley, and there ensued a clamorous contest
between them about I know not what.

<P>&nbsp;`What fools they are!' drawled Mr. Grimsby, who had been talking
away, at my elbow, with sententious gravity all the time; but I had been
too much absorbed in contemplating the deplorable state of the other two--specially
Arthur--to attend to him.

<P>&nbsp;`Did you ever hear such nonsense as they talk, Mrs. Huntingdon?'
he continued. `I'm quite ashamed of them for my part: they can't take so
much as a bottle between them without its getting into their heads--'

<P>&nbsp;`You are pouring the cream into your saucer, Mr. Grimsby.'

<P>&nbsp;`Ah! yes, I see, but we're almost in darkness here. Hargrave,
snuff those candles, will you?'

<P>&nbsp;`They're wax; they don't require snuffing,' said I.

<P>&nbsp;`"The light of the body is the eye,"' observed Hargrave, with
a sarcastic smile. `"If thine eye be <I>single</I> thy whole body shall
be full of light."'

<P>&nbsp;Grimsby repulsed him with a solemn wave of the hand, and then,
turning to me, continued, with the same drawling tones, and strange uncertainty
of utterance and heavy gravity of aspect as before, `But as I was saying,
Mrs. Huntingdon,--they have no head at all: they can't take half a bottle
without being affected some way; whereas I--well, I've taken three times
as much as they have to-night, and you see I'm perfectly steady. Now that
may strike you as very singular, but I think I can explain it:--you see
<I>their</I> brains--I mention no names, but you'll understand to whom
I allude--their brains are light to begin with, and the fumes of the fermented
liquor render them lighter still, and produce an entire light-headedness,
or giddiness, resulting in intoxication; whereas <I>my</I> brains being
composed of more solid materials will absorb a considerable quantity of
this alcoholic vapour without the production of any sensible result--'

<P>&nbsp;`I think you will find a sensible result produced on that tea,'
interrupted Mr. Hargrave, `by the quantity of sugar you have put into it.
Instead of your usual complement of one lump you have put in six.'

<P>&nbsp;`Have I so?' replied the philosopher, diving with his spoon into
the cup and bringing up several half-dissolved pieces in confirmation of
the assertion. `Um! I perceive. Thus, Madam, you see the evil of absence
of mind--of thinking too much while engaged in the common concerns of life.
Now if I had my wits about me, like ordinary men, instead of within me
like a philosopher, I should not have spoiled this cup of tea, and been
constrained to trouble you for another.--With your permission, I'll turn
this into the slop-basin.'

<P>&nbsp;`That is the sugar-basin, Mr. Grimsby. Now you have spoiled the
sugar too; and I'll thank you to ring for some more--for here is Lord Lowborough,
at last; and I hope his lordship will condescend to sit down with us, such
as we are, and allow me to give him some tea.

<P>&nbsp;His lordship gravely bowed in answer to my appeal, but said nothing.
Meantime, Hargrave volunteered to ring for the sugar, while Grimsby lamented
his mistake, and attempted to prove that it was owing to the shadow of
the urn and the badness of the lights.

<P>&nbsp;Lord Lowborough had entered a minute or two before, unobserved
by any one but me, and been standing before the door, grimly surveying
the company. He now stepped up to Annabella, who sat with her back towards
him, with Hattersley still beside her, though not now attending to her,
being occupied in vociferously abusing and bullying his host.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, Annabella,' said her husband, as he leant over the back
of her chair, `which of these three "bold, manly spirits" would you have
me to resemble?'

<P>&nbsp;`By Heaven and earth, you shall resemble us all!' cried Hattersley,
starting up and rudely seizing him by the arm. `Hallo Huntingdon!' he shouted--
`I've got him! Come, man, and help me! And d--n me body and soul if I don't
make him blind drunk before I let him go! He shall make up for all past
delinquencies as sure as I'm a living soul!'

<P>&nbsp;There followed a disgraceful contest; Lord Lowborough, in desperate
earnest, and pale with anger, silently struggling to release himself from
the powerful madman that was striving to drag him from the room. I attempted
to urge Arthur to interfere in behalf of his outraged guest, but he could
do nothing but laugh.

<P>&nbsp;`Huntingdon, you fool, come and help me, can't you!' cried Hattersley,
himself somewhat weakened by his excesses.

<P>&nbsp;`I'm wishing you God-speed, Hattersley,' cried Arthur, `and aiding
you with my prayers: I can't do anything else if my life depended on it!
I'm quite used up. Oh, ho!' and leaning back in his seat, he clapped his
hands on his sides and groaned aloud.

<P>&nbsp;`Annabella, give me a candle!' said Lowborough whose antagonist
had now got him round the waist and was endeavouring to root him from the
door-post to which he madly clung with all the energy of desperation.

<P>&nbsp;`<I>I</I> shall take no part in your rude sports!' replied the
lady, coldly drawing back, `I wonder you can expect it.'

<P>&nbsp;But I snatched up a candle and brought it to him. He took it and
held the flame to Hattersley's hands till, roaring like a wild beast, the
latter unclasped them and let him go. He vanished, I suppose to his own
apartment, for nothing more was seen of him till the morning. Swearing
and cursing like a maniac, Hattersley threw himself on to the ottoman beside
the window. The door being now free, Milicent attempted to make her escape
from the scene of her husband's disgrace; but he called her back, and insisted
upon her coming to him.

<P>&nbsp;`What do you want Ralph?' murmured she, reluctantly approaching
him.

<P>&nbsp;`I want to know what's the matter with you,' said he, pulling
her on to his knee like a child. `What are you crying for Milicent?--Tell
me!'

<P>&nbsp;`I'm not crying.'

<P>&nbsp;`You are,' persisted he, rudely pulling her hands from her face.
`How dare you tell such a lie?'

<P>&nbsp;`I'm not crying now,' pleaded she.

<P>&nbsp;`But you have been--and just this minute too; and I <I>will</I>
know what for. Come now, you <I>shall</I> tell me!'

<P>&nbsp;`Do let me alone Ralph! remember we are not at home.'

<P>&nbsp;`No matter: you <I>shall</I> answer my question!' exclaimed her
tormentor; and he attempted to extort the confession by shaking her and
remorselessly crushing her slight arms in the gripe of his powerful fingers.

<P>&nbsp;`Don't let him treat your sister in that way,' said I to Mr. Hargrave.

<P>&nbsp;`Come now, Hattersley, I can't allow that,' said that gentleman,
stepping up to the ill-assorted couple. `You let my sister alone, if you
please.' And he made an effort to unclasp the ruffian's fingers from her
arm, but was suddenly driven backward and nearly laid upon the floor by
a violent blow in the chest accompanied with the admonition,

<P>&nbsp;`Take that for your insolence!--and learn not to interfere between
me and mine again.'

<P>&nbsp;`If you were not beastly drunk, I'd have satisfaction for that!'
gasped Hargrave, white and breathless as much from passion as from the
immediate effects of the blow.

<P>&nbsp;`Go to the devil!' responded his brother-in-law. `Now Milicent,
tell me what you were crying for.'

<P>&nbsp;`I'll tell you some other time,' murmured she, `when we are alone.'

<P>&nbsp;`Tell me now!' said he with another shake and a squeeze that made
her draw in her breath and bite her lip to suppress a cry of pain.

<P>&nbsp;<I>`I'll</I> tell you, Mr. Hattersley,' said I. `She was crying
from pure shame and humiliation for you; because she could not bear to
see you conduct yourself so disgracefully.'

<P>&nbsp;`Confound you, Madam!' muttered he, with a stare of stupid amazement
at my `impudence.' `It was <I>not</I> that--was it Milicent?'

<P>&nbsp;She was silent.

<P>&nbsp;`Come, speak up child!'

<P>&nbsp;`I can't tell now,' sobbed she.

<P>&nbsp;`But you can say "yes" or "no" as well as "I can't tell--come!'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes,' she whispered, hanging her head and blushing at the awful
acknowledgement.

<P>&nbsp;`Curse you for an impertinent huzzy then!' cried he, throwing
her from him with such violence that she fell on her side; but she was
up again before either I or her brother could come to her assistance, and
made the best of her way out of the room and, I suppose, up stairs, without
loss of time.

<P>&nbsp;The next object of assault was Arthur, who sat opposite, and had
no doubt richly enjoyed the whole scene.

<P>&nbsp;`Now Huntingdon,' exclaimed his irascible friend, `I WILL NOT
have you sitting there and laughing like an idiot!'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, Hattersley!' cried he, wiping his swimming eyes--`you'll
be the death of me.'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes I will, but not as you suppose: I'll have the heart out of
your body, man, if you irritate me with any more of that imbecile laughter!
What! are you at it yet?--There! see if that'll settle you!' cried Hattersley,
snatching up a footstool and hurling it at the head of his host; but he
missed his aim and the latter still sat collapsed and quaking with feeble
laughter, with the tears running down his face; a deplorable spectacle
indeed. Hattersley tried cursing and swearing, but it would not do; he
then took a number of books from the table beside him and threw them, one
by one, at the object of his wrath, but Arthur only laughed the more; and,
finally, Hattersley rushed upon him in a phrensy, and, seizing him by the
shoulders, gave him a violent shaking, under which he laughed and shrieked
alarmingly. But I saw no more: I thought I had witnessed enough of my husband's
degradation; and, leaving Annabella and the rest to follow when they pleased,
I withdrew--but not to bed. Dismissing Rachel to her rest, I walked up
and down my room, in an agony of misery, for what had been done, and suspense,
not knowing what might further happen or how or when that unhappy creature
would come up to bed.

<P>&nbsp;At last he came, slowly and stumblingly, ascending the stairs,
supported by Grimsby and Hattersley, who neither of them walked quite steadily
themselves, but were both laughing and joking at him, and making noise
enough for all the servants to hear. He himself was no longer laughing
now, but sick and stupid--I will write no more about <I>that</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Such disgraceful scenes (or nearly such) have been repeated more
than once. I don't say much to Arthur about it, for if I did, it would
do more harm than good; but I let him know that I intensely dislike such
exhibitions; and each time he has promised they should never again be repeated;
but I fear he is losing the little self-command and self-respect he once
possessed: formerly, he would have been ashamed to act thus--at least,
before any other witnesses than his boon companions, or such as they. His
friend Hargrave, with a prudence and self-government that I envy for <I>him</I>,
never disgraces himself by taking more than sufficient to render him a
little `elevated,' and is always the first to leave the table, after Lord
Lowborough, who, wiser still, perseveres in vacating the dining-room immediately
after us; but never once, since Annabella offended him so deeply, has he
entered the drawing-room before the rest; always spending the interim in
the library, which I take care to have lighted for his accommodation--or,
on fine moonlight nights, in roaming about the grounds. But I think she
regrets her misconduct, for she has never repeated it since, and of late
she has comported herself with wonderful propriety towards him, treating
him with more uniform kindness and consideration than ever I have observed
her to do before. I date the time of this improvement from the period when
she ceased to hope and strive for Arthur's admiration.
