<H3>
A SCHEME OF ESCAPE</H3></CENTER>
My greatest source of uneasiness, in this time of trial, was my son, whom
his father and his father's friends delighted to encourage in all the embryo
vices a little child can show, and to instruct in all the evil habits he
could acquire in a word, to `make a man of him' was one of their staple
amusements; and I need say no more to justify my alarm on his account,
and my determination to deliver him at any hazard from the hands of such
instructors. I first attempted to keep him always with me or in the nursery,
and gave Rachel particular injunctions never to let him come down to dessert
as long as these `gentlemen' stayed; but it was no use; these orders were
immediately countermanded and over-ruled by his father: he was not going
to have the little fellow moped to death between an old nurse and a cursed
fool of a mother. So the little fellow came down every evening, in spite
of his cross mamma, and learnt to tipple wine like papa, to swear like
Mr. Hattersley, and to have his own way like a man, and sent mamma to the
devil when she tried to prevent him. To see such things done with the roguish
naivete of that pretty little child and hear such things spoken by that
small infantile voice, was as peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll
to them as it was inexpressibly distressing and painful to me; and when
he had set the table in a roar,' he would look round delightedly upon them
all, and add his shrill laugh to theirs. But if that beaming blue eye rested
on me, its light would vanish for a moment, and he would say, in some concern,--`Mamma,
why don't <I>you</I> laugh? Make her laugh, papa--she never will.'

<P>&nbsp;Hence, was I obliged to stay among these human brutes, watching
an opportunity to get my child away from them, instead of leaving them
immediately after the removal of the cloth, as I should always otherwise
have done. He was never willing to go, and I frequently had to carry him
away by force; for which he thought me very cruel and unjust; and sometimes
his father would insist upon my letting him remain;--and then, 336 I would
leave him to his kind friends, and retire to indulge my bitterness and
despair alone or to rack my brains for a remedy to this great evil.

<P>&nbsp;But here again, I must do Mr. Hargrave the justice to acknowledge
that I never saw <I>him</I> laugh at the child's misdemeanours, nor heard
him utter a word of encouragement to his aspirations after manly accomplishments.
But when anything very extraordinary was said or done by the infant profligate,
I noticed, at times, a peculiar expression in his face, that I could neither
interpret nor defined slight twitching about the muscles of the mouths
sudden flash in the eye, as he darted a sudden glance at the child and
then at me; and then, I could fancy there arose a gleam of hard, keen,
sombre satisfaction in his countenance at the look of impotent wrath and
anguish he was too certain to behold in mine. But on one occasion, when
Arthur had been behaving particularly ill, and Mr. Huntingdon and his guests
had been particularly provoking and insulting to me in their encouragement
of him, and I particularly anxious to get him out of the room, and on the
very point of demeaning myself by a burst of uncontrollable passion--Mr.
Hargrave suddenly rose from his seat, with an aspect of stern determination,
lifted the child from his father's knee, where he was sitting half tipsy,
cocking his head and laughing at me, and execrating me with words he little
knew the meaning of,--handed him out of the room, and setting him down
in the hall, held the door open for me, gravely bowed as I withdrew, and
closed it after me. I heard high words exchanged between him and his already
half-inebriated host as I departed, leading away my bewildered and disconcerted
boy,

<P>&nbsp;But this should not continue; my child must not be abandoned to
this corruption: better far that he should live in poverty and obscurity
with a fugitive mother, than in luxury and affluence with such a father.
These guests might not be with us long, but they would return again; and
he, the most injurious of the whole, his child's worst enemy, would still
remain. I could endure it for myself, but for my son it must be borne no
longer: the world's opinion and the feelings of my friends must be alike
unheeded here, at least, alike unable to deter me from my duty. But where
should I find an asylum, and how obtain 337 subsistence for us both? Oh,
I would take my precious charge at early dawn, take the coach to M--, flee
to the port of

<P>&nbsp;cross the Atlantic, and seek a quiet, humble home in New England,
where I would support myself and him by the labour of my hands. The palette
and the easel, my darling playmates once, must be my sober toil-fellows
now. But was I sufficiently skilful as an artist to obtain my livelihood
in a strange land, without friends and without recommendation? No; I must
wait a little; I must labour hard to improve my talent and to produce something
worth while as a specimen of my powers, something to speak favourably for
me, whether as an actual painter or a teacher. Brilliant success, of course,
I did not look for, but some degree of security from positive failure was
indispensable--I must not take my son to starve. And then I must have money
for the journey, the passage, and some little to support us in our retreat
in case I should be unsuccessful at first; and not too little either, for
who could tell how long I might have to struggle with the indifference
or neglect of others, or my own inexperience, or inability to suit their
tastes?

<P>&nbsp;What should I do then? Apply to my brother, and explain my circumstances
and my resolves to him? No, no; even if I told him <I>all</I> my grievances,
which I should be very reluctant to do, he would be certain to disapprove
of the step: it would seem like madness to him, as it would to my uncle
and aunt, or to Milicent. No; I must have patience and gather a hoard of
my own. Rachel should be my only confidant--I thought I could persuade
her into the scheme; and she should help me, first to find out a picture
dealer in some distant town; then, through her means, I would privately
sell what pictures I had on hand that would do for such a purpose, and
some of those I should thereafter paint. Besides this, I would contrive
to dispose of my jewels--not the family jewels, but the few I brought with
me from home, and those my uncle gave me on my marriage. A few months'
arduous toil might well be borne by me, with such an end in view; and in
the interim, my son could not be much more injured than he was already.

<P>&nbsp;Having formed this resolution, I immediately set to work to accomplish
it. I might possibly have been induced to wax cool 338 upon it afterwards,
or perhaps, to keep weighing the pros and cons in my mind till the latter
overbalanced the former, and I was driven to relinquish the project altogether,
or delay the execution of it to an indefinite period,--had not something
occurred to confirm me in that determination to which I still adhere, which
I still think I did well to form, and shall do better to execute.

<P>&nbsp;Since Lord Lowborough's departure, I had regarded the library
as entirely my own, a secure retreat at all hours of the day. None of our
gentlemen had the smallest pretensions to a literary taste, except Mr.
Hargrave; and he, at present, was quite contented with the newspapers and
periodicals of the day. And if, by any chance, he should look in here,
I felt assured he would soon depart on seeing me, for instead of becoming
less cool and distant towards me, he had become decidedly more so since
the departure of his mother and sisters, which was just what I wished.
Here, then, I set up my easel, and here I worked at my canvass from daylight
till dusk, with very little intermission saving when pure necessity, or
my duties to little Arthur called me away--for I still thought proper to
devote some portion of every day exclusively to his instruction and amusement.
But contrary to my expectation, on the third morning, while I was thus
employed, Mr. Hargrave <I>did</I> look in, and did <I>not</I> immediately
withdraw on seeing me. He apologized for his instrusion, and said he was
only come for a book; but when he had got it, he condescended to cast a
glance over my picture. Being a man of taste, he had something to say on
this subject as well as another, and having modestly commented on it, without
much encouragement from me, he proceeded to expatiate on the art in general.
Receiving no encouragement in that either, he dropped it, but did not depart.

<P>&nbsp;`You don't give us much of your company, Mrs. Huntingdon,' observed
he, after a brief pause, during which I went on coolly mixing and tempering
my colours; `and I cannot wonder at it, for you must be heartily sick of
us all. I myself am so thoroughly ashamed of my companions, and so weary
of their irrational conversation and pursuits--now that there is no one
to humanize them and keep them in check, since you have justly abandoned
us to our own devices--that I think I 339 shall presently withdraw from
amongst them--probably within this weekend I cannot suppose you will regret
my departure.

<P>&nbsp;He paused. I did not answer.

<P>&nbsp;`Probably,' he added, with a smile, `your only regret on the subject
will be, that I do not take all my companions along with me. I flatter
myself, at times, that though among them, I am not of them; but it is natural
that you should be glad to get rid of me. I may regret this, but I cannot
blame you for it.'

<P>&nbsp;`I shall not rejoice at <I>your</I> departure, for you <I>can</I>
conduct yourself like a gentleman,' said I, thinking it but right to make
some acknowledgment for his good behaviour, `but I must confess I shall
rejoice to bid adieu to the rest, inhospitable as it may appear.

<P>&nbsp;`No one can blame you for such an avowal,' replied he gravely;
`not even the gentlemen themselves, I imagine. I'll just tell you,' he
continued, as if actuated by a sudden resolution, `what was said last night
in the dining-room, after you left us--perhaps you will not mind it as
you're so <I>very</I> philosophical on certain points,' he added with a
slight sneer. `They were talking about Lord Lowborough and his delectable
lady, the cause of whose sudden departure is no secret amongst them; and
her character is so well known to them all, that, nearly related to me
as she is, I could not attempt to defend it.--God curse me,' he muttered,
<I>par parenth&egrave;se,</I> `if I don't have vengeance for this! If the
villain <I>must</I> disgrace the family, must he blazon it abroad to every
low-bred knave of his acquaintance?--I beg your pardon, Mrs. Huntingdon.
Well, they were talking of these things, and some of them remarked that,
as she was separated from her husband, he might see her again when he pleased.'

<P>&nbsp;`"Thank you," said he; "I've had enough of her for the present:
I'll not trouble to see her, unless she comes to me."

<P>&nbsp;`"Then what do you mean to do, Huntingdon, when we're gone?" said
Ralph Hattersley. "Do you mean to turn from the error of your ways, and
be a good husband, a good father, and so forth--as I do, when I get shut
of you and all these rollicking devils you call your friends? I think it's
time; and your wife is fifty times too good for you, you <I>know</I>--"

<P>&nbsp;340

<P>&nbsp;`And he added some praise of you, which you would not thank me
for repeating--or him for uttering; proclaiming it aloud, as he did, without
delicacy or discrimination, in an audience where it seemed profanation
to utter your name--himself utterly incapable of understanding or appreciating
your real excellencies. Huntingdon meanwhile, sat quietly drinking his
wine, or looking smilingly into his glass and offering no interruption
or reply, till Hattersley shouted out,--

<P>&nbsp;`"Do you hear me, man?"

<P>&nbsp;`"Yes, go on," said he.

<P>&nbsp;`"Nay, I've done," replied the other: "I only want to know if
you intend to take my advice."

<P>&nbsp;`"What advice?"

<P>&nbsp;`"To turn over a new leaf, you double-dyed scoundrel," shouted
Ralph, "and beg your wife's pardon, and be a good boy for the future."

<P>&nbsp;`"My wife! what wife? I have no wife," replied Huntingdon, looking
innocently up from his glass--"or if I have, look you gentlemen, I value
her so highly that any one among you, that can fancy her, may have her
and welcome--you may, by Jove and my blessing into the bargain!"

<P>&nbsp;`I--hem--some one asked if he really meant what he said, upon
which, he solemnly swore he did, and no mistake.--What do you think of
that, Mrs. Huntingdon?' asked Mr. Hargrave, after a short pause, during
which I had felt he was keenly examining my half-averted face.

<P>&nbsp;`I say,' replied I, calmly, `that what he prizes so lightly, will
not be long in his possession.'

<P>&nbsp;`You cannot mean that you will break your heart and die for the
detestable conduct of an infamous villain like that!'

<P>&nbsp;`By no means: my heart is too thoroughly dried to be broken in
a hurry, and I mean to live as long as I can.'

<P>&nbsp;`Will you leave him then?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;`When--and how?' asked he, eagerly.

<P>&nbsp;<I>`When</I> I am ready, and <I>how</I> I can manage it most effectually.'

<P>&nbsp;`But your child?'

<P>&nbsp;`My child goes with me.'

<P>&nbsp;341

<P>&nbsp;`He will not allow it.'

<P>&nbsp;`I shall not ask him.'

<P>&nbsp;`Ah, then, it is a secret flight you meditate!--but with whom,
Mrs. Huntingdon?'

<P>&nbsp;`With my son--and, possibly, his nurse.'

<P>&nbsp;`Alone--and unprotected! But where can you go? What can you do?
He will follow you and bring you back.'

<P>&nbsp;`I have laid my plans too well for that. Let me once get clear
of Grassdale, and I shall consider myself safe.'

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Hargrave advanced one step towards me, looked me in the face,
and drew in his breath to speak; but that look, that heightened colour,
that sudden sparkle of the eye made my blood rise in wrath: I abruptly
turned away, and, snatching up my brush, began to dash away at my canvass
with rather too much energy for the good of the picture.

<P>&nbsp;`Mrs. Huntingdon,' said he with bitter solemnity, `you are cruel--cruel
to me--cruel to yourself.'

<P>&nbsp;`Mr. Hargrave, remember your promise.'

<P>&nbsp;`I <I>must</I> speak--my heart will burst if I don't! I have been
silent long enough--and you <I>must</I> hear me!' cried he boldly intercepting
my retreat to the door. `You tell me you owe no allegiance to your husband;
he openly declares himself weary of you, and calmly gives you up to any
body that will take you; you are about to leave him; no one will believe
that you go alone--all the world will say, "She has left him at last, and
who can wonder at it? Few can blame her, fewer still can pity him; but
who is the companion of her flight?" Thus you will have no credit for your
virtue (if you call it such): even your best friends will not believe in
it; because, it is monstrous, and not to be credited--but by those who
suffer from the effects of it, such cruel torments that they know it to
be indeed reality.--But what can you do in the cold, rough world alone?
you, a young and inexperienced woman, delicately nurtured, and utterly--'

<P>&nbsp;`In a word, you would advise me to stay where I am,' interrupted
I. `Well, I'll see about it.'

<P>&nbsp;`By <I>all means,</I> leave him!' cried he earnestly, `but NOT
alone! Helen! let <I>me</I> protect you!'

<P>&nbsp;342

<P>&nbsp;`Never!--while Heaven spares my reason,' replied I, snatching
away the hand he had presumed to seize and press between his own. But he
was in for it now; he had fairly broken the barrier: he was completely
roused, and determined to hazard all for victory.

<P>&nbsp;`I must not be denied!' exclaimed he vehemently; and seizing both
my hands, he held them very tight, but dropped upon his knee, and looked
up in my face with a half-imploring, half-imperious gaze. `You have no
reason now: you are flying in the face of Heaven's decrees. God has designed
me to be your comfort and Protector--I feel it--I know it as certainly
as if a voice from Heaven declared "Ye twain shall be one flesh"--and you
spurn me from you--

<P>&nbsp;`Let me go, Mr. Hargrave!' said I sternly. But he only tightened
his grasp.

<P>&nbsp;`Let me go!' I repeated, quivering with indignation.

<P>&nbsp;His face was almost opposite the window as he knelt. With a slight
start, I saw him glance towards it; and then a gleam of malicious triumph
lit up his countenance. Looking over my shoulder, I beheld a shadow just
retiring round the corner.

<P>&nbsp;`That is Grimsby,' said he deliberately. `He will report what
he has seen to Huntingdon and all the rest, with such embellishments as
he thinks proper. He has no love for you, Mrs. Huntingdon--no reverence
for your sex--no belief in virtue--no admiration for its image. He will
give such a version of this story as will leave no doubt at all, about
your character, in the minds of those who hear it. Your fair fame is gone;
and nothing that I or you can say can ever retrieve it. But give me the
power to protect you, and show me the villain that dares to insult!'

<P>&nbsp;`No one has ever dared to insult me as you are doing now!' said
I, at length releasing my hands, and recoiling from him.

<P>&nbsp;`I do not insult you,' cried he: `I worship you. You are my angel--my
divinity! I lay my powers at your feet--and you must and shall accept them!'
he exclaimed impetuously, starting to his feet--I <I>mill</I> be your consoler
and defender! and if your conscience upbraid you for it, say I overcame
you and you could not choose but yield!'

<P>&nbsp;I never saw a man so terribly excited. He precipitated himself
towards me. I snatched up my palette-knife and held it 343 against him.
This startled him: he stood and gazed at me in astonishment; I dare say
I looked as fierce and resolute as he. I moved to the bell and put my hand
upon the cord. This tamed him still more. With a half-authoritative, half-deprecating
wave of the hand, he sought to deter me from ringing.

<P>&nbsp;`Stand off, then!' said I. He stepped back.-- `And listen to me.--I
don't like you,' I continued, as deliberately and emphatically as I could,
to give the greater efficacy to my words; `and if I were divorced from
my husband--or if he were dead, I would not marry you. There now! I hope
you're satisfied.'

<P>&nbsp;His face grew blanched with anger.

<P>&nbsp;`I <I>am</I> satisfied,' he replied with bitter emphasis, `that
you are the most cold-hearted, unnatural, ungrateful woman I ever yet beheld!'

<P>&nbsp;`Ungrateful sir?'

<P>&nbsp;`Ungrateful.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, Mr. Hargrave; I am not. For all the good you ever did me,
or ever wished to do, I most sincerely thank you: for all the evil you
have done me, and all you would have done, I pray God to pardon you, and
make you of a better mind.'

<P>&nbsp;Here the door was thrown open, and Messrs. Huntingdon and Hattersley
appeared without. The latter remained in the hall, busy with his ram-rod
and his gun; the former walked in, and stood with his back to the fire,
surveying Mr. Hargrave and me, particularly the former, with a smile of
insupportable meaning, accompanied as it was, by the impudence of his brazen
brow and the sly, malicious twinkle of his eye.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, sir?' said Hargrave interrogatively, and with the air of
one prepared to stand on the defensive.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, sir,' returned his host.

<P>&nbsp;`We want to know if you're at liberty to join us in a go at the
pheasants, Walter,' interposed Hattersley from without. `Come! there shall
be nothing shot besides, except a puss' or two; <I>I'll </I>vouch for that.'

<P>&nbsp;Walter did not answer, but walked to the window to collect his
faculties, Arthur uttered a low whistle, and followed him with his eyes.
A slight flush of anger rose to Hargrave's cheek; but in a moment, he turned
calmly round, and said carelessly-- 344

<P>&nbsp;`I came here to bid farewell to Mrs. Huntingdon, and tell her
I must go to-morrow.

<P>&nbsp;`Humph! You're mighty sudden in your resolution. What takes you
off so soon, may I ask?'

<P>&nbsp;`Business,' returned he, repelling the other's incredulous sneer
with a glance of scornful defiance.

<P>&nbsp;`Very good,' was the reply; and Hargrave walked away. Thereupon,
Mr. Huntingdon, gathering his coat laps under his arms, and setting his
shoulder against the mantle-piece, turned to me, and, addressing me in
a low voice, scarcely above his breath, poured forth a volley of the vilest
and grossest abuse it was possible for the imagination to conceive or the
tongue to utter. I did not attempt to interrupt him; but my spirit kindled
within me, and when he had done, I replied--

<P>&nbsp;`If your accusation were true, Mr. Huntingdon, how <I>dare you
</I>blame me?'

<P>&nbsp;`She's hit it, by Jove!' cried Hattersley, rearing his gun against
the wall; and, stepping into the room, he took his precious friend by the
arm, and attempted to drag him away. `Come, my lad,' he muttered; `true
or false, <I>you've</I> no right to blame her, you <I>know</I>--nor him
either; after what you said last night. So come along.'

<P>&nbsp;There was something implied here that I could not endure.

<P>&nbsp;`Dare you suspect me, Mr. Hattersley?' said I, almost beside myself
with fury.

<P>&nbsp;`Nay, nay, I suspect nobody. It's all right--it's all right. So
come along Huntingdon, you blackguard.'

<P>&nbsp;`She can't deny it!' cried the gentleman thus addressed, grinning
in mingled rage and triumph. `She can't deny it if her life depended on
it!' and muttering some more abusive language, he walked into the hall,
and took up his hat and gun from the table.

<P>&nbsp;`I scorn to justify myself to you!' said I. `But you,' turning
to Hattersley, `if you presume to have any doubts on the subject, ask Mr.
Hargrave.'

<P>&nbsp;At this, they simultaneously burst into a rude laugh that made
my whole frame tingle to the finger's ends.

<P>&nbsp;`Where is he? I'll ask him myself!' said I, advancing towards
them.

<P>&nbsp;345

<P>&nbsp;Suppressing a new burst of merriment, Hattersley pointed to the
outer door. It was half open. His brother-in-law was standing on the front
without.

<P>&nbsp;`Mr. Hargrave, will you please to step this way?' said I. He turned
and looked at me in grave surprise. `Step this way, if you please!' I repeated,
in so determined a manner that he could not, or did not choose to resist
its authority. Somewhat reluctantly he ascended the steps and advanced
a pace or two into the hall.

<P>&nbsp;`And tell those gentlemen,' I continued-- `these <I>men</I> whether
or not I yielded to your solicitations.'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't understand you, Mrs. Huntingdon.'

<P>&nbsp;`You <I>do</I> understand me, sir; and I charge you upon your
honour as a gentleman (if you have any), to answer truly. Did I, or did
I not?'

<P>&nbsp;`No,' muttered he, turning away.

<P>&nbsp;`Speak up sir; they can't hear you. Did I grant your request?'

<P>&nbsp;`You did not.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, I'll be sworn she didn't,' said Hattersley, `or he'd never
look so black.'

<P>&nbsp;`I'm willing to grant you the satisfaction of a gentleman, Huntingdon,'
said Mr. Hargrave, calmly addressing his host, but with a bitter sneer
upon his countenance.

<P>&nbsp;`Go to the deuce!' replied the latter, with an impatient jerk
of the head. Hargrave withdrew with a look of cold disdain, saying,--

<P>&nbsp;`You know where to find me, should you feel disposed to send a
friend.'

<P>&nbsp;Muttered oaths and curses were all the answer this intimation
obtained.

<P>&nbsp;`Now Huntingdon, you see!' said Hattersley, `clear as the day.'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't care <I>what</I> he sees,' said I, `or what he imagines;
but you, Mr. Hattersley, when you hear my name belied and slandered, will
you defend it?'

<P>&nbsp;`I will. Blast me if I don't!'

<P>&nbsp;I instantly departed, and shut myself into the library. What could
possess me to make such a request of such a man? I 346 cannot tell, but
drowning men catch at straws: they had driven me desperate between them;
I hardly knew what I said. There was no other to preserve my name from
being blackened and aspersed among this nest of boon companions, and through
them, perhaps into the world; and beside my abandoned wretch of a husband,
the base, malignant Grimsby, and the false villain Hargrave, this boarish
ruffian, coarse and brutal as he was, shone like a glow-worm in the dark,
among its fellow worms.

<P>&nbsp;What a scene was this! Could I ever have imagined that I should
be doomed to bear such insults under my own roof--to hear such things spoken
in my presence--nay spoken <I>to</I> me and <I>of</I> me--and by those
who arrogated to themselves the name of gentlemen? And could I have imagined
that I should have been able to endure it as calmly, and to repel their
insults as firmly and as boldly as I had done? A hardness such as this,
is taught by rough experience and despair alone.

<P>&nbsp;Such thoughts as these, chased one another through my mind, as
I paced to and fro the room, and longed--oh, <I>how</I> I longed to take
my child and leave them now, without an hour's delay! But it could not
be: there was work before me--hard work, that must be done.

<P>&nbsp;`Then let me do it,' said I, `and lose not a moment in vain repinings,
and idle chafings against my fate, and those who influence it.'

<P>&nbsp;And conquering my agitation with a powerful effort, I immediately
resumed my task, and laboured hard all day.

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Hargrave did depart on the morrow; and I have never seen him
since. The others stayed on for two or three weeks longer; but I kept aloof
from them as much as possible, and still continued my labour, and have
continued it, with almost unabated ardour, to the present day. I soon acquainted
Rachel with my design, confiding all my motives and intentions to her ear,
and much to my agreeable surprise, found little difficulty in persuading
her to enter into my views. She is a sober, cautious woman, but she so
hates her master, and so loves her mistress and her nursling, that after
several ejaculations, a few faint objections, and many tears and lamentations
that I should be brought to such a pass, she applauded my resolution and
consented to aid me with all her might--on one condition, 347

<P>&nbsp;only--that she might share my exile: otherwise, she was utterly
inexorable, regarding it as perfect madness for me and Arthur to go alone.
With touching generosity, she modestly offered to aid me with her little
hoard of savings, hoping I would `excuse her for the liberty, but really
if I would do her the favour to accept it as a loan, she should be very
happy.' Of course I could not think of such a thing;--but now, thank Heaven,
I have gathered a little hoard of my own, and my preparations are so far
advanced, that I am looking forward to a speedy emancipation. Only let
the stormy severity of this winter weather be somewhat abated, and then,
some morning Mr. Huntingdon will come down to a solitary breakfast-table,
and perhaps be clamouring through the house for his invisible wife and
child, when they are some fifty miles on their way to the western world--or
it may be more, for we shall leave him hours before the dawn, and it is
not probable he will discover the loss of both, until the day is far advanced.

<P>&nbsp;I am fully alive to the evils that may, and must result upon the
step I am about to take; but I never waver in my resolution, because I
never forget my son. It was only this morning--while I pursued my usual
employment, he was sitting at my feet, quietly playing with the shreds
of canvass I had thrown upon the carpet--but his mind was otherwise occupied,
for, in a while, he looked up wistfully in my face, and gravely asked--

<P>&nbsp;`Mamma, why are you wicked?'

<P>&nbsp;`Who told you I was wicked, love?'

<P>&nbsp;`Rachel.'

<P>&nbsp;`No Arthur, Rachel never said so, I am certain.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well then, it was papa,' replied he thoughtfully. Then, after
a reflective pause, he added, `At least, I'll tell you how it was I got
to know: when I'm with papa, if I say mamma wants me, or mamma says I'm
not to do something that he tells me to do--he always says, "Mamma be damned,'--and
Rachel says it's only wicked people that are damned. So mamma, that's why
I think you must be wicked--and I wish you wouldn't.'

<P>&nbsp;`My dear child, I am not. Those are bad words, and wicked people
often say them of others better than themselves. Those words cannot make
people be damned, nor show that they deserve it. God will judge us by our
own thoughts and deeds, 348 not by what others say about us. And when you
hear such words spoken, Arthur, remember never to repeat them: it is wicked
to say such things of others, not to have them said against you.

<P>&nbsp;`Then it's papa that's wicked,' said he, ruefully.

<P>&nbsp;`Papa is wrong to say such things, and you will be very wrong
to imitate him, now that you know better.'

<P>&nbsp;`What <I>is</I> imitate?'

<P>&nbsp;`To do as he does.'

<P>&nbsp;`Does <I>he</I> know better?'

<P>&nbsp;`Perhaps he does; but that is nothing to you.'

<P>&nbsp;`If he doesn't, you ought to tell him, mamma.'

<P>&nbsp;`I <I>have</I> told him.'

<P>&nbsp;The litHe moralist paused and pondered. I tried in vain to divert
his mind from the subject.

<P>&nbsp;`I'm sorry papa's wicked,' said he mournfully, at length, `for
I don't want him to go to hell.' And so saying he burst into tears.

<P>&nbsp;I consoled him with the hope that perhaps his papa would alter
and become good before he died--but is it not time to deliver him from
such a parent?
