October 5th.--Esther Hargrave is getting a fine girl. She is not out of
the school-room yet, but her mother frequently brings her over to call
in the mornings when the gentlemen are out, and sometimes she spends an
hour or two in company with her sister, and me, and the children; and when
we go to the Grove, I always contrive to see her, and talk more to her
than to any one else, for I am very much attached to my little friend,
and so is she to me. I wonder what she can see to like in me though, for
I am no longer the happy, lively girl I used to be; but she has no other
society--save that of her uncongenial mother, and her governess (as artificial
and conventional a person as that prudent mother could procure to rectify
the pupil's natural qualities), and, now and then, her subdued, quiet sister.
I often wonder what will be <I>her</I> lot in life--and so does she; but
<I>her</I> speculations on the future are full of buoyant hope--so were
mine once. I shudder to think of her being awakened like me to a sense
of their delusive vanity. It seems as if I should feel her disappointment
even more deeply than my own: I feel, almost, as if I were born for such
a fate, but <I>she</I> is so joyous and fresh, so light of heart and free
of spirit, and so guileless and unsuspecting too--oh, it would be cruel
to make her feel as I feel now, and know what I have known!

<P>&nbsp;Her sister trembles for her too. Yesterday morning, one of October's
brightest, loveliest days, Milicent and I were in the garden enjoying a
brief half hour together with our children, while Annabella was lying on
the drawing-room sofa, deep in the last new novel. We had been romping
with the little creatures, almost as merry and wild as themselves, and
now paused in the shade of the tall copper beech, to recover breath and
rectify our hair, disordered by the rough play and the frolicsome breeze--while
they toddled together along the broad, sunny walk; my Arthur supporting
the feebler steps of her little Helen, and sagaciously pointing out to
her the brightest beauties of the border as they passed, with semi-articulate
prattle that did as well for her as any other mode of discourse. From laughing
at the pretty sight, we began to talk of the children's future life; and
that made us thoughtful. We both relapsed into silent musing as we slowly
proceeded up the walk; and I suppose Milicent by a train of associations
was led to think of her sister.

<P>&nbsp;`Helen,' said she, `you often see Esther, don't you?'

<P>&nbsp;`Not very often.'

<P>&nbsp;`But you have more frequent opportunities of meeting her than
I have: and she loves you I know, and reverences you too: there is nobody's
opinion she thinks so much of, and she says you have more sense than mamma.'

<P>&nbsp;`That is because she is self-willed, and my opinions more generally
coincide with her own than your mamma's. But what then, Milicent?'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, since you have so much influence with her, I wish you would
seriously impress it upon her, never, on any account, or for any body's
persuasion, to marry for the sake of money, or rank, or establishment,
or any earthly thing, but true affection and well-grounded esteem.'

<P>&nbsp;`There is no necessity for that,' said I: `for we have had some
discourse on that subject already, and I assure you her ideas of love and
matrimony are as romantic as any one could desire.'

<P>&nbsp;`But romantic notions will not do: I want her to have true notions.'

<P>&nbsp;`Very right, but in my judgment, what the world stigmatizes as
romantic, is often more nearly allied to the truth than is commonly supposed;
for, if the generous ideas of youth are too often overclouded by the sordid
views of after-life, that scarcely proves them to be false.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, but if you think her ideas are what they ought to be, strengthen
them, will you? and confirm them, as far as you can; for <I>I</I> had romantic
notions once, and--I don't mean to say that I regret my lot, for I am quite
sure I don't--but--'

<P>&nbsp;`I understand you,' said I; `you are contented for yourself, but
you would not have your sister to suffer the same as you.

<P>&nbsp;`No--or worse. She might have far worse to suffer than I--for
I <I>am really</I> contented, Helen, though you mayn't think it: I speak
the solemn truth in saying that I would not exchange my husband for any
man on earth, if I might do it by the plucking of this leaf.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, I believe you: now that you have him, you would not exchange
<I>him</I> for another; but then you would gladly exchange some of his
qualities for those of better men.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes; just as I would gladly exchange some of my own qualities
for those of better women; for neither he nor I are perfect, and I desire
his improvement as earnestly as my own. And he will improve--don't you
think so Helen?--he's only six and twenty yet.

<P>&nbsp;`He may,' I answered.

<P>&nbsp;`He will--he WILL!' repeated she.

<P>&nbsp;`Excuse the faintness of my acquiescence, Milicent; I would not
discourage your hopes for the world, but mine have been so often disappointed,
that I am become as cold and doubtful in my expectations as the flattest
of octogenarians.'

<P>&nbsp;`And yet you do hope, still--even for Mr. Huntingdon?'

<P>&nbsp;`I do, I confess--"even" for <I>him;</I> for it seems as if life
and hope must cease together. And is he so <I>much</I> worse, Milicent,
than Mr. Hattersley?'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, to give you my candid opinion, I think there is no comparison
between them. But you mustn't be offended, Helen, for you know I always
speak my mind; and you may speak yours too; I shan't care.'

<P>&nbsp;`I am not offended, love; and <I>my</I> opinion is that if there
<I>be</I> a comparison made between the two, the difference, for the most
part, is certainly in Hattersley's favour.'

<P>&nbsp;Milicent's own heart told her how much it cost me to make this
acknowledgement; and, with a childlike impulse, she expressed her sympathy
by suddenly kissing my cheek, without a word of reply, and then turning
quickly away caught up her baby, and hid her face in its frock. How odd
it is that we so often weep for each other's distresses, when we shed not
a tear for our own! Her heart had been full enough of her own sorrows,
but it overflowed at the idea of mine;--and I too, shed tears at the sight
of her sympathetic emotion, though I had not wept for myself for many a
week.

<P>&nbsp;But Milicent's satisfaction in her choice, is not entirely feigned:
she really loves her husband; and it is too true that he loses nothing
by comparison with mine. Either he is less unbridled in his excesses, or
owing to his stronger, hardier frame, they produce a much less deleterious
effect upon him; for he never reduces himself to a state in any degree
bordering on imbecility, and with him the worst effect of a night's debauch
is a slight increase of irascibility, or it may be a season of sullen ferocity
on the following morning: there is nothing of that lost, depressing appearance--that
peevish, ignoble fretfulness, that wears one out with very shame for the
transgressor. But then, it was not formerly so with Arthur: he can bear
less now than he could at Hattersley's age; and if the latter does not
reform, his powers of endurance may be equally impaired when he has tried
them as long. He has five years the advantage of his friend, and his vices
have not mastered him yet: he has not folded them to him and made them
a part of himself. They seem to sit loose upon him, like a cloak that he
could throw aside at any moment if he would--but how long will that option
be left him?--Though a creature of passion and sense, regardless of the
duties and the higher privileges of intelligent beings, he is no voluptuary:
he prefers the more active and invigorating animal enjoyments, to those
of a more relaxing, enervating kind. He does not make a <I>science</I>
of the gratification of his appetites either in the pleasures of the table
or anything else; he eats heartily what is set before him, without demeaning
himself by any of that abandonment to the palate and the eye--that unbecoming
particularity in approval or disapproval which it is so hateful to witness
in those we would esteem. Arthur, I fear, would give himself up to luxury
as the chief good, and might ultimately plunge into the grossest excesses,
but for the fear of irremediably blunting his appetites, and destroying
his powers of further enjoyment. For Hattersley, graceless ruffian as he
is, I believe there is more reasonable ground of hope; and--far be it from
me to blame poor Milicent for his delinquencies--but I do think that if
she had the courage or the will to speak her mind about them, and maintain
her point unflinchingly, there would be more chance of his reclamation,
and he would be likely to treat her better, and love her more, in the end.
I am partly led to think so by what he said to me himself, not many days
ago--I purpose to give her a little advice on the subject some time; but
still, I hesitate from the consciousness that her ideas and disposition
are both against it, and if my counsels failed to do good, they would do
harm by making her more unhappy.

<P>&nbsp;It was one rainy day last week: most of the company were killing
time in the billiard-room, but Milicent and I were with little Arthur and
Helen in the library, and between our books, our children, and each other,
we expected to make out a very agreeable morning. We had not been thus
secluded above two hours, however, when Mr. Hattersley came in attracted,
I suppose, by the voice of his child as he was crossing the hall, for he
is prodigiously fond of her, and she of him.

<P>&nbsp;He was redolent of the stables, where he had been regaling himself
with the company of his fellow-creatures, the horses, ever since breakfast.
But that was no matter to my little namesake: as soon as the colossal person
of her father darkened the door, she uttered a shrill scream of delight,
and, quitting her mother's side, ran crowing towards him--balancing her
course with out-stretched arms,--and, embracing his knee, threw back her
head and laughed in his face. He might well look smilingly down upon those
small, fair features radiant with innocent mirth, those clear, blue, shining
eyes, and that soft flaxen hair cast back upon the little ivory neck and
shoulders. Did he not think how unworthy he was of such a possession? I
fear no such idea crossed his mind. He caught her up, and there followed
some minutes of very rough play, during which it is difficult to say whether
the father or the daughter laughed and shouted the loudest. At length,
however, the boisterous pastime terminated--suddenly, as might be expected:
the little one was hurt and began to cry; and its ungentle playfellow tossed
it into its mother's lap, bidding her `make all straight.' As happy to
return to that gentle comforter as it had been to leave her, the child
nestled in her arms and hushed its cries in a moment; and, sinking its
little weary head on her bosom, soon dropped asleep.

<P>&nbsp;Meantime, Mr. Hattersley strode up to the fire, and, interposing
his height and breadth between us and it, stood, with arms akimbo, expanding
his chest, and gazing round him as if the house and all its appurtenances
and contents were his own undisputed possessions.

<P>&nbsp;`Deuced bad weather this!' he began. `There'll be no shooting
to-day, I guess.' Then, suddenly lifting up his voice, he regaled us with
a few bars of a rollicking song, which abruptly ceasing, he finished the
tune with a whistle, and then continued,-- `I say Mrs. Huntingdon, what
a fine stud your husband has!--not large but good.--I've been looking at
them a bit this morning; and upon my word, Black Bess, and Grey Tom, and
that young Nimrod are the finest animals I've seen for many a day!' Then
followed a particular discussion of their various merits, succeeded by
a sketch of the great things <I>he</I> intended to do in the horse-jockey
line when his old governor thought proper to quit the stage.-- `Not that
I wish him to close his accounts, added he; `the old Trojan is welcome
to keep his books open as long as he pleases for me.'

<P>&nbsp;`I hope so, <I>indeed</I>, Mr. Hattersley!'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh yes! It's only my way of talking. The event must come, sometime,
and so I look to the bright side of it--that's the right plan, isn't it,
Mrs. H.?--What are you two doing here, by the by--where's Lady Lowborough?'

<P>&nbsp;`In the billiard room.

<P>&nbsp;`What a splendid creature she <I>is</I>!' continued he, fixing
his eyes on his wife, who changed colour, and looked more and more disconcerted
as he proceeded. `What a noble figure she has! and what magnificent black
eyes; and what a fine spirit of her own;--and what a tongue of her own,
too, when she likes to use it--I perfectly adore her!--But never mind,
Milicent; I wouldn't have her for my wife--not if she'd a kingdom for her
dowry! I'm better satisfied with the one I have.--Now, <I>then</I>! what
do you look so sulky for? don't you believe me?'

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, I believe you,' murmured she, in a tone of half sad, half
sullen resignation, as she turned away to stroke the hair of her sleeping
infant, that she had laid on the sofa beside her.

<P>&nbsp;`Well <I>then,</I> what makes you so cross? Come here Milly, and
tell me why you can't be satisfied with my assurance.'

<P>&nbsp;She went, and, putting her little hand within his arm, looked
up in his face, and said softly,--

<P>&nbsp;`What does it amount to Ralph? Only to this, that though you admire
Annabella so much, and for qualities that I don't possess, you would still
rather have me than her for your wife, which merely proves that you don't
think it necessary to love your wife: you are satisfied if she can keep
your house and take care of your child. But I'm not cross; I'm only sorry;
for,' added she in a low, tremulous accent, withdrawing her hand from his
arm, and bending her looks on the rug, `if you don't love me, you don't,
and it can't be helped.'

<P>&nbsp;`Very true: but who told you I didn't? Did I say I loved Annabella?'

<P>&nbsp;`You said you adored her.'

<P>&nbsp;`True, but adoration isn't love. I adore Annabella, but I don't
love her; and I love thee Milicent, but I don't adore thee.' In proof of
his affection, he clutched a handful of her light brown ringlets and appeared
to twist them unmercifully.

<P>&nbsp;`Do you really, Ralph?' murmured she with a faint smile beaming
through her tears, just putting up her hand to his, in token that he pulled
<I>rather</I> too hard.

<P>&nbsp;`To be sure I do,' responded he: `only you bother me rather, sometimes.'

<P>&nbsp;`I bother you!' cried she in very natural surprise.

<P>&nbsp;`Yes, <I>you</I>--but only by your exceeding goodness--when a
boy has been cramming raisins and sugar-plums all day, he longs for a squeeze
of sour orange by way of a change. And did you never, Milly, observe the
sands on the sea-shore; how nice and smooth they look, and how soft and
easy they feel to the foot? But if you plod along, for half an hour, over
this soft, easy carpet--giving way at every step, yielding the more the
harder you press,--you'll find it rather wearisome work, and be glad enough
to come to a bit of good, firm rock, that won't budge an inch whether you
stand, walk, or stamp upon it; and, though it be hard as the nether millstone,
you'll find it the easier footing after all.'

<P>&nbsp;`I know what you mean, Ralph,' said she, nervously playing with
her watch-guard and tracing the figure on the rug with the point of her
tiny foot, `I know what you mean, but I thought you always liked to be
yielded to; and I can't alter now.

<P>&nbsp;`I do like it,' replied he, bringing her to him by another tug
at her hair. `You mustn't mind my talk Milly. A man must have something
to grumble about; and if he can't complain that his wife harries him to
death with her perversity and ill-humour, he must complain that she wears
him out with her kindness and gentleness.'

<P>&nbsp;`But why complain at all, unless, because you are tired and dissatisfied?'

<P>&nbsp;`To excuse my own failings, to be sure. Do you think I'll bear
all the burden of my sins on my own shoulders, as long as there's another
ready to help me, with none of her own to carry?'

<P>&nbsp;`There is no such one on earth,' said she seriously; and then,
taking his hand from her head, she kissed it with an air of genuine devotion,
and tripped away to the door.

<P>&nbsp;`What now?' said he. `Where are you going?'

<P>&nbsp;`To tidy my hair,' she answered, smiling through her disordered
locks: `you've made it all come down.'

<P>&nbsp;`Off with you then!--An excellent little woman,' he remarked when
she was gone, `but a thought too soft--she almost melts in one's hands.
I positively think I ill-use her sometimes, when I've taken too much--but
I can't help it, for she never complains, either at the time or after.
I suppose she doesn't mind it.'

<P>&nbsp;`I can enlighten you on that subject, Mr. Hattersley,' said I:
`she <I>does</I> mind it; and some other things she minds still more, which,
yet, you may never hear her complain of.'

<P>&nbsp;`How do you know?--does she complain to you?' demanded he, with
a sudden spark of fury ready to burst into a flame if I should answer `Yes.'

<P>&nbsp;`No,' I replied; `but I have known her longer and studied her
more closely than you have done.--And I can tell you, Mr. Hattersley, that
Milicent loves you more than you deserve, and that you have it in your
power to make her very happy, instead of which you are her evil genius,
and, I will venture to say, there is not a single day passes in which you
do not inflict upon her some pang that you might spare her if you would.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well--it's not <I>my</I> fault,' said he, gazing carelessly up
at the ceiling and plunging his hands into his pockets: `if my ongoings
don't suit her, she should tell me so.'

<P>&nbsp;`Is she not exactly the wife you wanted? Did you not tell Mr.
Huntingdon you must have one that would submit to anything without a murmur,
and never blame you, whatever you did?'

<P>&nbsp;`True, but we shouldn't always have what we want: it spoils the
best of us, doesn't it? How can I help playing the deuce when I see it's
all one to her whether I behave like a Christian or like a scoundrel such
as nature made me?--and how can I help teazing her when she's so invitingly
meek and mim--when she lies down like a spaniel at my feet and never so
much as squeaks to tell me that's enough?'

<P>&nbsp;`If you are a tyrant by nature, the temptation is strong, I allow;
but no generous mind delights to oppress the weak, but rather to cherish
and protect.'

<P>&nbsp;`I <I>don't</I> oppress her; but it's so confounded flat to be
always cherishing and protecting;--and then how can I tell that I <I>am
</I>oppressing her when she "melts away and makes no sign?"' I sometimes
think she has no feeling at all; and then I go on till she cries--and that
satisfies me.

<P>&nbsp;`Then you <I>do</I> delight to oppress her.'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't, I tell you!--only when I'm in a bad humour--or a particularly
good one, and want to afflict for the pleasure of comforting; or when she
looks flat and wants shaking up a bit. And sometimes, she provokes me by
crying for nothing, and won't tell me what it's for; and then, I allow,
it enrages me past bearing--especially, when I'm not my own man.'

<P>&nbsp;`As is no doubt generally the case on such occasions,' said I.
`But in future, Mr. Hattersley, when you see her looking flat or crying
for "nothing" (as you call it), ascribe it all to yourself: be assured
it is something you have done amiss, or your general misconduct that distresses
her.'

<P>&nbsp;`I don't believe it. If it were, she should tell me so: I don't
like that way of moping and fretting in silence, and saying nothing--it's
not honest. How can she expect me to mend my ways at that rate?'

<P>&nbsp;`Perhaps she gives you credit for having more sense than you possess,
and deludes herself with the hope that you will one day see your own errors
and repair them, if left to your own reflection.'

<P>&nbsp;`None of your sneers, Mrs. Huntingdon! I <I>have</I> the sense
to see that I'm not always quite correct--but sometimes I think that's
no great matter, as long as I injure nobody but myself--'

<P>&nbsp;`It <I>is</I> a great matter,' interrupted I, `both to yourself
(as you will hereafter find to your cost) and to all connected with you--most
especially your wife--but indeed, it is nonsense to talk about injuring
no one but yourself, it is impossible to injure yourself--especially by
such acts as we allude to--without injuring hundreds, if not thousands,
besides, in a greater or less degree, either by the evil you do or the
good you leave undone.'

<P>&nbsp;`And as I was saying,' continued he-- `or would have said if you
hadn't taken me up so short--I sometimes think I should do better if I
were joined to one that would always remind me when I was wrong, and give
me a motive for doing good and eschewing evil by decidedly showing her
approval of the one, and disapproval of the other.'

<P>&nbsp;`If you had no higher motive than the approval of your fellow
mortal, it would do you little good.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, but if I had a mate that would not always be yielding,
and always equally kind, but that would have the spirit to stand at bay
now and then, and honestly tell me her mind at all times--such a one as
yourself for instance--now if I went on with you as I do with her when
I'm in London, you'd make the house too hot to hold me at times, I'll be
sworn.

<P>&nbsp;`You mistake me: I'm no termagant.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, all the better for that, for I can't stand contradiction--in
a general way--and I'm as fond of my own will as another: only I think
too much of it doesn't answer for any man.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, I would never contradict you without a cause, but certainly
I would always let you know what I thought of your conduct; and if you
oppressed me, in body, mind, or estate, you should at least have no reason
to suppose "I didn't mind it.

<P>&nbsp;`I know that my lady; and I think if my little wife were to follow
the same plan it would be better for us both.'

<P>&nbsp;`I'll tell her.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, no, let her be; there's much to be said on both sides--and,
now I think upon it, Huntingdon often regrets that you are not more like
her--scoundrelly dog that he is--and you see, after all, you can't reform
<I>him:</I> he's <I>ten</I> times worse than I.--He's afraid of you, to
be sure--that is, he's always on his best behaviour in your presence--but--'

<P>&nbsp;`I wonder what his worst behaviour is like, then?' I could not
forbear observing.

<P>&nbsp;`Why, to tell you the truth, it's very bad indeed isn't it, Hargrave?'
said he, addressing that gentleman, who had entered the room unperceived
by me, for I was now standing near the fire with my back to the door. `Isn't
Huntingdon,' he continued, `as great a reprobate as ever was d--d?'

<P>&nbsp;`His lady will not hear him censured with impunity,' replied Mr.
Hargrave, coming forward, `but I must say, I thank God I am not such another.'

<P>&nbsp;`Perhaps it would become you better,' said I, `to look at what
you are, and say, "God be merciful to me a sinner."'

<P>&nbsp;`You are severe,' returned he, bowing slightly and drawing himself
up with a proud yet injured air. Hattersley laughed, and clapped him on
the shoulder. Moving from under his hand with a gesture of insulted dignity,
Mr. Hargrave took himself away to the other end of the rug.

<P>&nbsp;`Isn't it a shame, Mrs. Huntingdon?' cried his brother-in-law--
`I struck Walter Hargrave when I was drunk, the second night after we came,
and he's turned a cold shoulder on me ever since; though I asked his pardon
the very morning after it was done!'

<P>&nbsp;`Your manner of asking it,' returned the other, `and the clearness
with which you remembered the whole transaction, showed you were not too
drunk to be fully conscious of what you were about, and quite responsible
for the deed.'

<P>&nbsp;`You wanted to interfere between me and my wife,' grumbled Hattersley,
`and that is enough to provoke any man.

<P>&nbsp;`You justify it then?' said his opponent, darting upon him a most
vindictive glance.

<P>&nbsp;`No, I tell you I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been under
excitement; and if you choose to bear malice for it, after all the handsome
things I've said--do so and be damned!'

<P>&nbsp;`I <I>would</I> refrain from such language in a <I>lady's</I>
presence, at least,' said Mr. Hargrave, hiding his anger under a mask of
disgust.

<P>&nbsp;`What have I said?' returned Hattersley. `Nothing but Heaven's
truth--he will be damned, won't he, Mrs. Huntingdon, if he doesn't forgive
his brother's trespasses?'

<P>&nbsp;`You ought to forgive him, Mr. Hargrave, since he asks you,' said
I.

<P>&nbsp;`Do you say so? Then I will!' And, smiling almost frankly, he
stepped forward and offered his hand. It was immediately clasped in that
of his relative, and the reconciliation was apparently cordial on both
sides.

<P>&nbsp;`The affront,' continued Hargrave, turning to me, `owed half its
bitterness to the fact of its being offered in your presence; and since
you bid me forgive it, I will--and forget it too.'

<P>&nbsp;`I guess the best return I can make, will be to take myself off,'
muttered Hattersley, with a broad grin. His companion smiled; and he left
the room. This put me on my guard. Mr. Hargrave turned seriously to me,
and earnestly began--

<P>&nbsp;`Dear Mrs. Huntingdon, how I have longed for, yet dreaded this
hour! Do not be alarmed,' he added, for my face was crimson with anger;
`I am not about to offend you with any useless entreaties or complaints.
I am not going to presume to trouble you with the mention of my own feelings
or your perfections, but I have something to reveal to you which you ought
to know, and which, yet, it pains me inexpressibly--'

<P>&nbsp;`Then don't trouble yourself to reveal it!'

<P>&nbsp;`But it is of importance--

<P>&nbsp;`If so, I shall hear it soon enough--specially if it is bad news,
as you seem to consider it. At present, I am going to take the children
to the nursery.

<P>&nbsp;`But can't you ring, and send them?'

<P>&nbsp;`No; I want the exercise of a run to the top of the house.--Come
Arthur.'

<P>&nbsp;`But you will return?'

<P>&nbsp;`Not yet; don't wait.'

<P>&nbsp;`Then, when may I see you again?'

<P>&nbsp;`At lunch,' said I, departing with little Helen in one arm, and
leading Arthur by the hand.

<P>&nbsp;He turned away, muttering some sentence of impatient censure or
complaint, in which `heartless' was the only distinguishable word.

<P>&nbsp;`What nonsense is this Mr. Hargrave?' said I, pausing in the doorway.
`What do you mean?'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, nothing--I did not intend you should hear my soliloquy. But
the fact is, Mrs. Huntingdon, I have a disclosure to make--painful for
me to offer as for you to hear--and I want you to give me a few minutes
of your attention in private, at any time and place you like to appoint.
It is from no selfish motive that I ask it, and not for any cause that
could alarm your super-human purity; therefore, you need not kill me with
that look of cold and pitiless disdain. I know too well the feelings with
which the bearers of bad tidings are commonly regarded, not to--'

<P>&nbsp;`What <I>is</I> this wonderful piece of intelligence?' said I,
impatiently interrupting him. `If it is anything of real importance, speak
it in three words before I go.'

<P>&nbsp;`In three words I cannot. Send those children away, and stay with
me.

<P>&nbsp;`No; keep your bad tidings to yourself. I know it is some thing
I don't want to hear, and something you would displease me by telling.'

<P>&nbsp;`You have divined too truly I fear; but still since I know it,
I feel it my duty to disclose it to you.'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh, spare us both the infliction--and I will exonerate you from
the duty. You have offered to tell; I have refused to hear: my ignorance
will not be charged on you.'

<P>&nbsp;`Be it so--you shall not hear it from me. But if the blow fall
too suddenly upon you when it comes, remember--I wished to soften it!'

<P>&nbsp;I left him. I was determined his words should not alarm me. What
could <I>he</I> of all men, have to reveal that was of importance for <I>me</I>
to hear? It was no doubt some exaggerated tale about my unfortunate husband,
that he wished to make the most of to serve his own bad purposes.

<P>&nbsp;6th. He has not alluded to this momentous mystery since; and I
have seen no reason to repent of my unwillingness to hear it. The threatened
blow has not been struck yet; and I do not greatly fear it. At present
I am pleased with Arthur: he has not positively disgraced himself for upwards
of a fortnight, and all this last week, has been so very moderate in his
indulgence at table, that I can perceive a marked difference in his general
temper and appearance. Dare I hope this will continue?
