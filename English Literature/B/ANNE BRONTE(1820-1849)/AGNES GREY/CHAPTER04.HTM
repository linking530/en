<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>I SPARE my readers the account of my delight on coming home, my

<P>happiness while there - enjoying a brief space of rest and liberty

<P>in that dear, familiar place, among the loving and the loved - and

<P>my sorrow on being obliged to bid them, once more, a long adieu.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I returned, however, with unabated vigour to my work - a more

<P>arduous task than anyone can imagine, who has not felt something

<P>like the misery of being charged with the care and direction of a

<P>set of mischievous, turbulent rebels, whom his utmost exertions

<P>cannot bind to their duty; while, at the same time, he is

<P>responsible for their conduct to a higher power, who exacts from

<P>him what cannot be achieved without the aid of the superior's more

<P>potent authority; which, either from indolence, or the fear of

<P>becoming unpopular with the said rebellious gang, the latter

<P>refuses to give.&nbsp; I can conceive few situations more harassing
than

<P>that wherein, however you may long for success, however you may

<P>labour to fulfil your duty, your efforts are baffled and set at

<P>nought by those beneath you, and unjustly censured and misjudged by

<P>those above.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I have not enumerated half the vexatious propensities of my pupils,

<P>or half the troubles resulting from my heavy responsibilities, for

<P>fear of trespassing too much upon the reader's patience; as,

<P>perhaps, I have already done; but my design in writing the few last

<P>pages was not to amuse, but to benefit those whom it might concern;

<P>he that has no interest in such matters will doubtless have skipped

<P>them over with a cursory glance, and, perhaps, a malediction

<P>against the prolixity of the writer; but if a parent has,

<P>therefrom, gathered any useful hint, or an unfortunate governess

<P>received thereby the slightest benefit, I am well rewarded for my

<P>pains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To avoid trouble and confusion, I have taken my pupils one by one,

<P>and discussed their various qualities; but this can give no

<P>adequate idea of being worried by the whole three together; when,

<P>as was often the case, all were determined to 'be naughty, and to

<P>tease Miss Grey, and put her in a passion.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sometimes, on such occasions, the thought has suddenly occurred to

<P>me - 'If they could see me now!' meaning, of course, my friends at

<P>home; and the idea of how they would pity me has made me pity

<P>myself - so greatly that I have had the utmost difficulty to

<P>restrain my tears:&nbsp; but I have restrained them, till my little

<P>tormentors were gone to dessert, or cleared off to bed (my only

<P>prospects of deliverance), and then, in all the bliss of solitude,

<P>I have given myself up to the luxury of an unrestricted burst of

<P>weeping.&nbsp; But this was a weakness I did not often indulge:&nbsp;
my

<P>employments were too numerous, my leisure moments too precious, to

<P>admit of much time being given to fruitless lamentations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I particularly remember one wild, snowy afternoon, soon after my

<P>return in January:&nbsp; the children had all come up from dinner,

<P>loudly declaring that they meant 'to be naughty;' and they had well

<P>kept their resolution, though I had talked myself hoarse, and

<P>wearied every muscle in my throat, in the vain attempt to reason

<P>them out of it.&nbsp; I had got Tom pinned up in a corner, whence, I

<P>told him, he should not escape till he had done his appointed task.

<P>Meantime, Fanny had possessed herself of my work-bag, and was

<P>rifling its contents - and spitting into it besides.&nbsp; I told her
to

<P>let it alone, but to no purpose, of course.&nbsp; 'Burn it, Fanny!'

<P>cried Tom:&nbsp; and THIS command she hastened to obey.&nbsp; I sprang
to

<P>snatch it from the fire, and Tom darted to the door.&nbsp; 'Mary Ann,

<P>throw her desk out of the window!' cried he:&nbsp; and my precious desk,

<P>containing my letters and papers, my small amount of cash, and all

<P>my valuables, was about to be precipitated from the three-storey

<P>window.&nbsp; I flew to rescue it.&nbsp; Meanwhile Tom had left the
room, and

<P>was rushing down the stairs, followed by Fanny.&nbsp; Having secured
my

<P>desk, I ran to catch them, and Mary Ann came scampering after.&nbsp;
All

<P>three escaped me, and ran out of the house into the garden, where

<P>they plunged about in the snow, shouting and screaming in exultant

<P>glee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What must I do?&nbsp; If I followed them, I should probably be unable
to

<P>capture one, and only drive them farther away; if I did not, how

<P>was I to get them in?&nbsp; And what would their parents think of me,
if

<P>they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless,

<P>gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?&nbsp; While I stood
in

<P>this perplexity, just without the door, trying, by grim looks and

<P>angry words, to awe them into subjection, I heard a voice behind

<P>me, in harshly piercing tones, exclaiming, -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Miss Grey!&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; What, in the devil's name, can
you be

<P>thinking about?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I can't get them in, sir,' said I, turning round, and beholding

<P>Mr. Bloomfield, with his hair on end, and his pale blue eyes

<P>bolting from their sockets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But I INSIST upon their being got in!' cried he, approaching

<P>nearer, and looking perfectly ferocious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then, sir, you must call them yourself, if you please, for they

<P>won't listen to me,' I replied, stepping back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Come in with you, you filthy brats; or I'll horsewhip you every

<P>one!' roared he; and the children instantly obeyed.&nbsp; 'There, you

<P>see! - they come at the first word!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, when YOU speak.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And it's very strange, that when you've the care of 'em you've no

<P>better control over 'em than that! - Now, there they are - gone up-

<P>stairs with their nasty snowy feet!&nbsp; Do go after 'em and see them

<P>made decent, for heaven's sake!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That gentleman's mother was then staying in the house; and, as I

<P>ascended the stairs and passed the drawing-room door, I had the

<P>satisfaction of hearing the old lady declaiming aloud to her

<P>daughter-in-law to this effect (for I could only distinguish the

<P>most emphatic words) -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gracious heavens! - never in all my life - ! - get their death as

<P>sure as - !&nbsp; Do you think, my dear, she's a PROPER PERSON?&nbsp;
Take my

<P>word for it - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I heard no more; but that sufficed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The senior Mrs. Bloomfield had been very attentive and civil to me;

<P>and till now I had thought her a nice, kind-hearted, chatty old

<P>body.&nbsp; She would often come to me and talk in a confidential

<P>strain; nodding and shaking her head, and gesticulating with hands

<P>and eyes, as a certain class of old ladies are won't to do; though

<P>I never knew one that carried the peculiarity to so great an

<P>extent.&nbsp; She would even sympathise with me for the trouble I had

<P>with the children, and express at times, by half sentences,

<P>interspersed with nods and knowing winks, her sense of the

<P>injudicious conduct of their mamma in so restricting my power, and

<P>neglecting to support me with her authority.&nbsp; Such a mode of

<P>testifying disapprobation was not much to my taste; and I generally

<P>refused to take it in, or understand anything more than was openly

<P>spoken; at least, I never went farther than an implied

<P>acknowledgment that, if matters were otherwise ordered my task

<P>would be a less difficult one, and I should be better able to guide

<P>and instruct my charge; but now I must be doubly cautious.

<P>Hitherto, though I saw the old lady had her defects (of which one

<P>was a proneness to proclaim her perfections), I had always been

<P>wishful to excuse them, and to give her credit for all the virtues

<P>she professed, and even imagine others yet untold.&nbsp; Kindness, which

<P>had been the food of my life through so many years, had lately been

<P>so entirely denied me, that I welcomed with grateful joy the

<P>slightest semblance of it.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that my heart warmed

<P>to the old lady, and always gladdened at her approach and regretted

<P>her departure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now, the few words luckily or unluckily heard in passing had

<P>wholly revolutionized my ideas respecting her:&nbsp; now I looked upon

<P>her as hypocritical and insincere, a flatterer, and a spy upon my

<P>words and deeds.&nbsp; Doubtless it would have been my interest still
to

<P>meet her with the same cheerful smile and tone of respectful

<P>cordiality as before; but I could not, if I would:&nbsp; my manner

<P>altered with my feelings, and became so cold and shy that she could

<P>not fail to notice it.&nbsp; She soon did notice it, and HER manner

<P>altered too:&nbsp; the familiar nod was changed to a stiff bow, the

<P>gracious smile gave place to a glare of Gorgon ferocity; her

<P>vivacious loquacity was entirely transferred from me to 'the

<P>darling boy and girls,' whom she flattered and indulged more

<P>absurdly than ever their mother had done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I confess I was somewhat troubled at this change:&nbsp; I feared the

<P>consequences of her displeasure, and even made some efforts to

<P>recover the ground I had lost - and with better apparent success

<P>than I could have anticipated.&nbsp; At one time, I, merely in common

<P>civility, asked after her cough; immediately her long visage

<P>relaxed into a smile, and she favoured me with a particular history

<P>of that and her other infirmities, followed by an account of her

<P>pious resignation, delivered in the usual emphatic, declamatory

<P>style, which no writing can portray.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But there's one remedy for all, my dear, and that's resignation'

<P>(a toss of the head), 'resignation to the will of heaven!' (an

<P>uplifting of the hands and eyes).&nbsp; 'It has always supported me

<P>through all my trials, and always will do' (a succession of nods).

<P>'But then, it isn't everybody that can say that' (a shake of the

<P>head); 'but I'm one of the pious ones, Miss Grey!' (a very

<P>significant nod and toss).&nbsp; 'And, thank heaven, I always was'

<P>(another nod), 'and I glory in it!' (an emphatic clasping of the

<P>hands and shaking of the head).&nbsp; And with several texts of

<P>Scripture, misquoted or misapplied, and religious exclamations so

<P>redolent of the ludicrous in the style of delivery and manner of

<P>bringing in, if not in the expressions themselves, that I decline

<P>repeating them, she withdrew; tossing her large head in high good-

<P>humour - with herself at least - and left me hoping that, after

<P>all, she was rather weak than wicked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At her next visit to Wellwood House, I went so far as to say I was

<P>glad to see her looking so well.&nbsp; The effect of this was magical:

<P>the words, intended as a mark of civility, were received as a

<P>flattering compliment; her countenance brightened up, and from that

<P>moment she became as gracious and benign as heart could wish - in

<P>outward semblance at least.&nbsp; From what I now saw of her, and what
I

<P>heard from the children, I know that, in order to gain her cordial

<P>friendship, I had but to utter a word of flattery at each

<P>convenient opportunity:&nbsp; but this was against my principles; and

<P>for lack of this, the capricious old dame soon deprived me of her

<P>favour again, and I believe did me much secret injury.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not greatly influence her daughter-in-law against me,

<P>because, between that lady and herself there was a mutual dislike -

<P>chiefly shown by her in secret detractions and calumniations; by

<P>the other, in an excess of frigid formality in her demeanour; and

<P>no fawning flattery of the elder could thaw away the wall of ice

<P>which the younger interposed between them.&nbsp; But with her son, the

<P>old lady had better success:&nbsp; he would listen to all she had to

<P>say, provided she could soothe his fretful temper, and refrain from

<P>irritating him by her own asperities; and I have reason to believe

<P>that she considerably strengthened his prejudice against me.&nbsp; She

<P>would tell him that I shamefully neglected the children, and even

<P>his wife did not attend to them as she ought; and that he must look

<P>after them himself, or they would all go to ruin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus urged, he would frequently give himself the trouble of

<P>watching them from the windows during their play; at times, he

<P>would follow them through the grounds, and too often came suddenly

<P>upon them while they were dabbling in the forbidden well, talking

<P>to the coachman in the stables, or revelling in the filth of the

<P>farm-yard - and I, meanwhile, wearily standing, by, having

<P>previously exhausted my energy in vain attempts to get them away.

<P>Often, too, he would unexpectedly pop his head into the schoolroom

<P>while the young people were at meals, and find them spilling their

<P>milk over the table and themselves, plunging their fingers into

<P>their own or each other's mugs, or quarrelling over their victuals

<P>like a set of tiger's cubs.&nbsp; If I were quiet at the moment, I was

<P>conniving at their disorderly conduct; if (as was frequently the

<P>case) I happened to be exalting my voice to enforce order, I was

<P>using undue violence, and setting the girls a bad example by such

<P>ungentleness of tone and language.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I remember one afternoon in spring, when, owing to the rain, they

<P>could not go out; but, by some amazing good fortune, they had all

<P>finished their lessons, and yet abstained from running down to

<P>tease their parents - a trick that annoyed me greatly, but which,

<P>on rainy days, I seldom could prevent their doing; because, below,

<P>they found novelty and amusement - especially when visitors were in

<P>the house; and their mother, though she bid me keep them in the

<P>schoolroom, would never chide them for leaving it, or trouble

<P>herself to send them back.&nbsp; But this day they appeared satisfied

<P>with, their present abode, and what is more wonderful still, seemed

<P>disposed to play together without depending on me for amusement,

<P>and without quarrelling with each other.&nbsp; Their occupation was
a

<P>somewhat puzzling one:&nbsp; they were all squatted together on the

<P>floor by the window, over a heap of broken toys and a quantity of

<P>birds' eggs - or rather egg-shells, for the contents had luckily

<P>been abstracted.&nbsp; These shells they had broken up and were pounding

<P>into small fragments, to what end I could not imagine; but so long

<P>as they were quiet and not in positive mischief, I did not care;

<P>and, with a feeling of unusual repose, I sat by the fire, putting

<P>the finishing stitches to a frock for Mary Ann's doll; intending,

<P>when that was done, to begin a letter to my mother.&nbsp; Suddenly the

<P>door opened, and the dingy head of Mr. Bloomfield looked in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'All very quiet here!&nbsp; What are you doing?' said he.&nbsp; 'No
harm TO-

<P>DAY, at least,' thought I.&nbsp; But he was of a different opinion.

<P>Advancing to the window, and seeing the children's occupations, he

<P>testily exclaimed - 'What in the world are you about?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'We're grinding egg-shells, papa!' cried Tom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How DARE you make such a mess, you little devils?&nbsp; Don't you see

<P>what confounded work you're making of the carpet?' (the carpet was

<P>a plain brown drugget).&nbsp; 'Miss Grey, did you know what they were

<P>doing?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, sir.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You knew it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You knew it! and you actually sat there and permitted them to go

<P>on without a word of reproof!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I didn't think they were doing any harm.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Any harm!&nbsp; Why, look there!&nbsp; Just look at that carpet, and
see -

<P>was there ever anything like it in a Christian house before?&nbsp; No

<P>wonder your room is not fit for a pigsty - no wonder your pupils

<P>are worse than a litter of pigs! - no wonder - oh! I declare, it

<P>puts me quite past my patience' and he departed, shutting the door

<P>after him with a bang that made the children laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It puts me quite past my patience too!' muttered I, getting up;

<P>and, seizing the poker, I dashed it repeatedly into the cinders,

<P>and stirred them up with unwonted energy; thus easing my irritation

<P>under pretence of mending the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, Mr. Bloomfield was continually looking in to see if the

<P>schoolroom was in order; and, as the children were continually

<P>littering the floor with fragments of toys, sticks, stones,

<P>stubble, leaves, and other rubbish, which I could not prevent their

<P>bringing, or oblige them to gather up, and which the servants

<P>refused to 'clean after them,' I had to spend a considerable

<P>portion of my valuable leisure moments on my knees upon the floor,

<P>in painsfully reducing things to order.&nbsp; Once I told them that
they

<P>should not taste their supper till they had picked up everything

<P>from the carpet; Fanny might have hers when she had taken up a

<P>certain quantity, Mary Ann when she had gathered twice as many, and

<P>Tom was to clear away the rest.&nbsp; Wonderful to state, the girls
did

<P>their part; but Tom was in such a fury that he flew upon the table,

<P>scattered the bread and milk about the floor, struck his sisters,

<P>kicked the coals out of the coal-pan, attempted to overthrow the

<P>table and chairs, and seemed inclined to make a Douglas-larder of

<P>the whole contents of the room:&nbsp; but I seized upon him, and,

<P>sending Mary Ann to call her mamma, held him, in spite of kicks,

<P>blows, yells, and execrations, till Mrs. Bloomfield made her

<P>appearance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What is the matter with my boy?' said she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And when the matter was explained to her, all she did was to send

<P>for the nursery-maid to put the room in order, and bring Master

<P>Bloomfield his supper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'There now,' cried Tom, triumphantly, looking up from his viands

<P>with his mouth almost too full for speech.&nbsp; 'There now, Miss Grey!

<P>you see I've got my supper in spite of you:&nbsp; and I haven't picked

<P>up a single thing!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The only person in the house who had any real sympathy for me was

<P>the nurse; for she had suffered like afflictions, though in a

<P>smaller degree; as she had not the task of teaching, nor was she so

<P>responsible for the conduct of her charge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Miss Grey!' she would say, 'you have some trouble with them

<P>childer!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I have, indeed, Betty; and I daresay you know what it is.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ay, I do so!&nbsp; But I don't vex myself o'er 'em as you do.&nbsp;
And

<P>then, you see, I hit 'em a slap sometimes:&nbsp; and them little 'uns
-

<P>I gives 'em a good whipping now and then:&nbsp; there's nothing else

<P>will do for 'em, as what they say.&nbsp; Howsoever, I've lost my place

<P>for it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Have you, Betty?&nbsp; I heard you were going to leave.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Eh, bless you, yes!&nbsp; Missis gave me warning a three wik sin'.&nbsp;
She

<P>told me afore Christmas how it mud be, if I hit 'em again; but I

<P>couldn't hold my hand off 'em at nothing.&nbsp; I know not how YOU do,

<P>for Miss Mary Ann's worse by the half nor her sisters!'
