<P>A HOUSE in A-, the fashionable watering-place, was hired for our

<P>seminary; and a promise of two or three pupils was obtained to

<P>commence with.&nbsp; I returned to Horton Lodge about the middle of

<P>July, leaving my mother to conclude the bargain for the house, to

<P>obtain more pupils, to sell off the furniture of our old abode, and

<P>to fit out the new one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We often pity the poor, because they have no leisure to mourn their

<P>departed relatives, and necessity obliges them to labour through

<P>their severest afflictions:&nbsp; but is not active employment the best

<P>remedy for overwhelming sorrow - the surest antidote for despair?

<P>It may be a rough comforter:&nbsp; it may seem hard to be harassed with

<P>the cares of life when we have no relish for its enjoyments; to be

<P>goaded to labour when the heart is ready to break, and the vexed

<P>spirit implores for rest only to weep in silence:&nbsp; but is not

<P>labour better than the rest we covet? and are not those petty,

<P>tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over the

<P>great affliction that oppresses us?&nbsp; Besides, we cannot have cares,

<P>and anxieties, and toil, without hope - if it be but the hope of

<P>fulfilling our joyless task, accomplishing some needful project, or

<P>escaping some further annoyance.&nbsp; At any rate, I was glad my mother

<P>had so much employment for every faculty of her action-loving

<P>frame.&nbsp; Our kind neighbours lamented that she, once so exalted
in

<P>wealth and station, should be reduced to such extremity in her time

<P>of sorrow; but I am persuaded that she would have suffered thrice

<P>as much had she been left in affluence, with liberty to remain in

<P>that house, the scene of her early happiness and late affliction,

<P>and no stern necessity to prevent her from incessantly brooding

<P>over and lamenting her bereavement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I will not dilate upon the feelings with which I left the old

<P>house, the well-known garden, the little village church - then

<P>doubly dear to me, because my father, who, for thirty years, had

<P>taught and prayed within its walls, lay slumbering now beneath its

<P>flags - and the old bare hills, delightful in their very

<P>desolation, with the narrow vales between, smiling in green wood

<P>and sparkling water - the house where I was born, the scene of all

<P>my early associations, the place where throughout life my earthly

<P>affections had been centred; - and left them to return no more!

<P>True, I was going back to Horton Lodge, where, amid many evils, one

<P>source of pleasure yet remained:&nbsp; but it was pleasure mingled with

<P>excessive pain; and my stay, alas! was limited to six weeks.&nbsp; And

<P>even of that precious time, day after day slipped by and I did not

<P>see him:&nbsp; except at church, I never saw him for a fortnight after

<P>my return.&nbsp; It seemed a long time to me:&nbsp; and, as I was often
out

<P>with my rambling pupil, of course hopes would keep rising, and

<P>disappointments would ensue; and then, I would say to my own heart,

<P>'Here is a convincing proof - if you would but have the sense to

<P>see it, or the candour to acknowledge it - that he does not care

<P>for you.&nbsp; If he only thought HALF as much about you as you do about

<P>him, he would have contrived to meet you many times ere this:&nbsp;
you

<P>must know that, by consulting your own feelings.&nbsp; Therefore, have

<P>done with this nonsense:&nbsp; you have no ground for hope:&nbsp; dismiss,
at

<P>once, these hurtful thoughts and foolish wishes from your mind, and

<P>turn to your own duty, and the dull blank life that lies before

<P>you.&nbsp; You might have known such happiness was not for you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But I saw him at last.&nbsp; He came suddenly upon me as I was crossing

<P>a field in returning from a visit to Nancy Brown, which I had taken

<P>the opportunity of paying while Matilda Murray was riding her

<P>matchless mare.&nbsp; He must have heard of the heavy loss I had

<P>sustained:&nbsp; he expressed no sympathy, offered no condolence:&nbsp;
but

<P>almost the first words he uttered were, - 'How is your mother?'

<P>And this was no matter-of -course question, for I never told him

<P>that I had a mother:&nbsp; he must have learned the fact from others,
if

<P>he knew it at all; and, besides, there was sincere goodwill, and

<P>even deep, touching, unobtrusive sympathy in the tone and manner of

<P>the inquiry.&nbsp; I thanked him with due civility, and told him she
was

<P>as well as could be expected.&nbsp; 'What will she do?' was the next

<P>question.&nbsp; Many would have deemed it an impertinent one, and given

<P>an evasive reply; but such an idea never entered my head, and I

<P>gave a brief but plain statement of my mother's plans and

<P>prospects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then you will leave this place shortly?' said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, in a month.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused a minute, as if in thought.&nbsp; When he spoke again, I hoped

<P>it would be to express his concern at my departure; but it was only

<P>to say, - 'I should think you will be willing enough to go?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes - for some things,' I replied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'For SOME things only - I wonder what should make you regret it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was annoyed at this in some degree; because it embarrassed me:&nbsp;
I

<P>had only one reason for regretting it; and that was a profound

<P>secret, which he had no business to trouble me about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why,' said I - 'why should you suppose that I dislike the place?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You told me so yourself,' was the decisive reply.&nbsp; 'You said,
at

<P>least, that you could not live contentedly, without a friend; and

<P>that you had no friend here, and no possibility of making one -

<P>and, besides, I know you MUST dislike it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But if you remember rightly, I said, or meant to say, I could not

<P>live contentedly without a friend in the world:&nbsp; I was not so

<P>unreasonable as to require one always near me.&nbsp; I think I could
be

<P>happy in a house full of enemies, if - ' but no; that sentence must

<P>not be continued - I paused, and hastily added, - 'And, besides, we

<P>cannot well leave a place where we have lived for two or three

<P>years, without some feeling of regret.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Will you regret to part with Miss Murray, your sole remaining

<P>pupil and companion?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I dare say I shall in some degree:&nbsp; it was not without sorrow
I

<P>parted with her sister.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I can imagine that.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, Miss Matilda is quite as good - better in one respect.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What is that?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'She's honest.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And the other is not?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I should not call her DIShonest; but it must be confessed she's a

<P>little artful.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'ARTFUL is she? - I saw she was giddy and vain - and now,' he

<P>added, after a pause, 'I can well believe she was artful too; but

<P>so excessively so as to assume an aspect of extreme simplicity and

<P>unguarded openness.&nbsp; Yes,' continued he, musingly, 'that accounts

<P>for some little things that puzzled me a trifle before.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After that, he turned the conversation to more general subjects.

<P>He did not leave me till we had nearly reached the park-gates:&nbsp;
he

<P>had certainly stepped a little out of his way to accompany me so

<P>far, for he now went back and disappeared down Moss Lane, the

<P>entrance of which we had passed some time before.&nbsp; Assuredly I
did

<P>not regret this circumstance:&nbsp; if sorrow had any place in my heart,

<P>it was that he was gone at last - that he was no longer walking by

<P>my side, and that that short interval of delightful intercourse was

<P>at an end.&nbsp; He had not breathed a word of love, or dropped one
hint

<P>of tenderness or affection, and yet I had been supremely happy.&nbsp;
To

<P>be near him, to hear him talk as he did talk, and to feel that he

<P>thought me worthy to be so spoken to - capable of understanding and

<P>duly appreciating such discourse - was enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, Edward Weston, I could indeed be happy in a house full of

<P>enemies, if I had but one friend, who truly, deeply, and faithfully

<P>loved me; and if that friend were you - though we might be far

<P>apart - seldom to hear from each other, still more seldom to meet -

<P>though toil, and trouble, and vexation might surround me, still -

<P>it would be too much happiness for me to dream of!&nbsp; Yet who can

<P>tell,' said I within myself, as I proceeded up the park, - 'who can

<P>tell what this one month may bring forth?&nbsp; I have lived nearly

<P>three-and-twenty years, and I have suffered much, and tasted little

<P>pleasure yet; is it likely my life all through will be so clouded?

<P>Is it not possible that God may hear my prayers, disperse these

<P>gloomy shadows, and grant me some beams of heaven's sunshine yet?

<P>Will He entirely deny to me those blessings which are so freely

<P>given to others, who neither ask them nor acknowledge them when

<P>received?&nbsp; May I not still hope and trust?&nbsp; I did hope and
trust

<P>for a while:&nbsp; but, alas, alas! the time ebbed away:&nbsp; one week

<P>followed another, and, excepting one distant glimpse and two

<P>transient meetings - during which scarcely anything was said -

<P>while I was walking with Miss Matilda, I saw nothing of him:

<P>except, of course, at church.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now, the last Sunday was come, and the last service.&nbsp; I was

<P>often on the point of melting into tears during the sermon - the

<P>last I was to hear from him:&nbsp; the best I should hear from anyone,
I

<P>was well assured.&nbsp; It was over - the congregation were departing;

<P>and I must follow.&nbsp; I had then seen him, and heard his voice, too,

<P>probably for the last time.&nbsp; In the churchyard, Matilda was pounced

<P>upon by the two Misses Green.&nbsp; They had many inquiries to make

<P>about her sister, and I know not what besides.&nbsp; I only wished they

<P>would have done, that we might hasten back to Horton Lodge:&nbsp; I

<P>longed to seek the retirement of my own room, or some sequestered

<P>nook in the grounds, that I might deliver myself up to my feelings

<P>- to weep my last farewell, and lament my false hopes and vain

<P>delusions.&nbsp; Only this once, and then adieu to fruitless dreaming
-

<P>thenceforth, only sober, solid, sad reality should occupy my mind.

<P>But while I thus resolved, a low voice close beside me said - 'I

<P>suppose you are going this week, Miss Grey?'&nbsp; 'Yes,' I replied.&nbsp;
I

<P>was very much startled; and had I been at all hysterically

<P>inclined, I certainly should have committed myself in some way

<P>then.&nbsp; Thank God, I was not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well,' said Mr. Weston, 'I want to bid you good-bye - it is not

<P>likely I shall see you again before you go.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Good-bye, Mr. Weston,' I said.&nbsp; Oh, how I struggled to say it

<P>calmly!&nbsp; I gave him my hand.&nbsp; He retained it a few seconds
in his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It is possible we may meet again,' said he; 'will it be of any

<P>consequence to you whether we do or not?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, I should be very glad to see you again.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I COULD say no less.&nbsp; He kindly pressed my hand, and went.&nbsp;
Now, I

<P>was happy again - though more inclined to burst into tears than

<P>ever.&nbsp; If I had been forced to speak at that moment, a succession

<P>of sobs would have inevitably ensued; and as it was, I could not

<P>keep the water out of my eyes.&nbsp; I walked along with Miss Murray,

<P>turning aside my face, and neglecting to notice several successive

<P>remarks, till she bawled out that I was either deaf or stupid; and

<P>then (having recovered my self-possession), as one awakened from a

<P>fit of abstraction, I suddenly looked up and asked what she had

<P>been saying.
