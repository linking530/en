<P>I ROSE next morning with a feeling of hopeful exhilaration, in

<P>spite of the disappointments already experienced; but I found the

<P>dressing of Mary Ann was no light matter, as her abundant hair was

<P>to be smeared with pomade, plaited in three long tails, and tied

<P>with bows of ribbon:&nbsp; a task my unaccustomed fingers found great

<P>difficulty in performing.&nbsp; She told me her nurse could do it in

<P>half the time, and, by keeping up a constant fidget of impatience,

<P>contrived to render me still longer.&nbsp; When all was done, we went

<P>into the schoolroom, where I met my other pupil, and chatted with

<P>the two till it was time to go down to breakfast.&nbsp; That meal being

<P>concluded, and a few civil words having been exchanged with Mrs.

<P>Bloomfield, we repaired to the schoolroom again, and commenced the

<P>business of the day.&nbsp; I found my pupils very backward, indeed;
but

<P>Tom, though averse to every species of mental exertion, was not

<P>without abilities.&nbsp; Mary Ann could scarcely read a word, and was
so

<P>careless and inattentive that I could hardly get on with her at

<P>all.&nbsp; However, by dint of great labour and patience, I managed
to

<P>get something done in the course of the morning, and then

<P>accompanied my young charge out into the garden and adjacent

<P>grounds, for a little recreation before dinner.&nbsp; There we got along

<P>tolerably together, except that I found they had no notion of going

<P>with me:&nbsp; I must go with them, wherever they chose to lead me.&nbsp;
I

<P>must run, walk, or stand, exactly as it suited their fancy.&nbsp; This,

<P>I thought, was reversing the order of things; and I found it doubly

<P>disagreeable, as on this as well as subsequent occasions, they

<P>seemed to prefer the dirtiest places and the most dismal

<P>occupations.&nbsp; But there was no remedy; either I must follow them,

<P>or keep entirely apart from them, and thus appear neglectful of my

<P>charge.&nbsp; To-day, they manifested a particular attachment to a well

<P>at the bottom of the lawn, where they persisted in dabbling with

<P>sticks and pebbles for above half an hour.&nbsp; I was in constant fear

<P>that their mother would see them from the window, and blame me for

<P>allowing them thus to draggle their clothes and wet their feet and

<P>hands, instead of taking exercise; but no arguments, commands, or

<P>entreaties could draw them away.&nbsp; If SHE did not see them, some
one

<P>else did - a gentleman on horseback had entered the gate and was

<P>proceeding up the road; at the distance of a few paces from us he

<P>paused, and calling to the children in a waspish penetrating tone,

<P>bade them 'keep out of that water.'&nbsp; 'Miss Grey,' said he, '(I

<P>suppose it IS Miss Grey), I am surprised that you should allow them

<P>to dirty their clothes in that manner!&nbsp; Don't you see how Miss

<P>Bloomfield has soiled her frock? and that Master Bloomfield's socks

<P>are quite wet? and both of them without gloves?&nbsp; Dear, dear!&nbsp;
Let

<P>me REQUEST that in future you will keep them DECENT at least!' so

<P>saying, he turned away, and continued his ride up to the house.

<P>This was Mr. Bloomfield.&nbsp; I was surprised that he should nominate

<P>his children Master and Miss Bloomfield; and still more so, that he

<P>should speak so uncivilly to me, their governess, and a perfect

<P>stranger to himself.&nbsp; Presently the bell rang to summon us in.&nbsp;
I

<P>dined with the children at one, while he and his lady took their

<P>luncheon at the same table.&nbsp; His conduct there did not greatly

<P>raise him in my estimation.&nbsp; He was a man of ordinary stature -

<P>rather below than above - and rather thin than stout, apparently

<P>between thirty and forty years of age:&nbsp; he had a large mouth, pale,

<P>dingy complexion, milky blue eyes, and hair the colour of a hempen

<P>cord.&nbsp; There was a roast leg of mutton before him:&nbsp; he helped
Mrs.

<P>Bloomfield, the children, and me, desiring me to cut up the

<P>children's meat; then, after twisting about the mutton in various

<P>directions, and eyeing it from different points, he pronounced it

<P>not fit to be eaten, and called for the cold beef.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What is the matter with the mutton, my dear?' asked his mate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It is quite overdone.&nbsp; Don't you taste, Mrs. Bloomfield, that
all

<P>the goodness is roasted out of it?&nbsp; And can't you see that all
that

<P>nice, red gravy is completely dried away?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I think the BEEF will suit you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The beef was set before him, and he began to carve, but with the

<P>most rueful expressions of discontent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What is the matter with the BEEF, Mr. Bloomfield?&nbsp; I'm sure I

<P>thought it was very nice.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And so it WAS very nice.&nbsp; A nicer joint could not be; but it is

<P>QUITE spoiled,' replied he, dolefully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How so?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How so!&nbsp; Why, don't you see how it is cut?&nbsp; Dear - dear!
it is

<P>quite shocking!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'They must have cut it wrong in the kitchen, then, for I'm sure I

<P>carved it quite properly here, yesterday.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No DOUBT they cut it wrong in the kitchen - the savages!&nbsp; Dear
-

<P>dear!&nbsp; Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely

<P>ruined?&nbsp; But remember that, in future, when a decent dish leaves

<P>this table, they shall not TOUCH it in the kitchen.&nbsp; Remember THAT,

<P>Mrs. Bloomfield!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Notwithstanding the ruinous state of the beef, the gentleman

<P>managed to out himself some delicate slices, part of which he ate

<P>in silence.&nbsp; When he next spoke, it was, in a less querulous tone,

<P>to ask what there was for dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Turkey and grouse,' was the concise reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And what besides?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Fish.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What kind of fish?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'YOU DON'T KNOW?' cried he, looking solemnly up from his plate, and

<P>suspending his knife and fork in astonishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No.&nbsp; I told the cook to get some fish - I did not particularize

<P>what.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, that beats everything!&nbsp; A lady professes to keep house,
and

<P>doesn't even know what fish is for dinner! professes to order fish,

<P>and doesn't specify what!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Perhaps, Mr. Bloomfield, you will order dinner yourself in

<P>future.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nothing more was said; and I was very glad to get out of the room

<P>with my pupils; for I never felt so ashamed and uncomfortable in my

<P>life for anything that was not my own fault.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the afternoon we applied to lessons again:&nbsp; then went out again;

<P>then had tea in the schoolroom; then I dressed Mary Ann for

<P>dessert; and when she and her brother had gone down to the dining-

<P>room, I took the opportunity of beginning a letter to my dear

<P>friends at home:&nbsp; but the children came up before I had half

<P>completed it.&nbsp; At seven I had to put Mary Ann to bed; then I played

<P>with Tom till eight, when he, too, went; and I finished my letter

<P>and unpacked my clothes, which I had hitherto found no opportunity

<P>for doing, and, finally, went to bed myself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this is a very favourable specimen of a day's proceedings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My task of instruction and surveillance, instead of becoming easier

<P>as my charges and I got better accustomed to each other, became

<P>more arduous as their characters unfolded.&nbsp; The name of governess,

<P>I soon found, was a mere mockery as applied to me:&nbsp; my pupils had

<P>no more notion of obedience than a wild, unbroken colt.&nbsp; The

<P>habitual fear of their father's peevish temper, and the dread of

<P>the punishments he was wont to inflict when irritated, kept them

<P>generally within bounds in his immediate presence.&nbsp; The girls,
too,

<P>had some fear of their mother's anger; and the boy might

<P>occasionally be bribed to do as she bid him by the hope of reward;

<P>but I had no rewards to offer; and as for punishments, I was given

<P>to understand, the parents reserved that privilege to themselves;

<P>and yet they expected me to keep my pupils in order.&nbsp; Other

<P>children might be guided by the fear of anger and the desire of

<P>approbation; but neither the one nor the other had any effect upon

<P>these.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Master Tom, not content with refusing to be ruled, must needs set

<P>up as a ruler, and manifested a determination to keep, not only his

<P>sisters, but his governess in order, by violent manual and pedal

<P>applications; and, as he was a tall, strong boy of his years, this

<P>occasioned no trifling inconvenience.&nbsp; A few sound boxes on the

<P>ear, on such occasions, might have settled the matter easily

<P>enough:&nbsp; but as, in that case, he might make up some story to his

<P>mother which she would be sure to believe, as she had such unshaken

<P>faith in his veracity - though I had already discovered it to be by

<P>no means unimpeachable - I determined to refrain from striking him,

<P>even in self-defence; and, in his most violent moods, my only

<P>resource was to throw him on his back and hold his hands and feet

<P>till the frenzy was somewhat abated.&nbsp; To the difficulty of

<P>preventing him from doing what he ought not, was added that of

<P>forcing him to do what he ought.&nbsp; Often he would positively refuse

<P>to learn, or to repeat his lessons, or even to look at his book.

<P>Here, again, a good birch rod might have been serviceable; but, as

<P>my powers were so limited, I must make the best use of what I had.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As there were no settled hours for study and play, I resolved to

<P>give my pupils a certain task, which, with moderate attention, they

<P>could perform in a short time; and till this was done, however

<P>weary I was, or however perverse they might be, nothing short of

<P>parental interference should induce me to suffer them to leave the

<P>schoolroom, even if I should sit with my chair against the door to

<P>keep them in.&nbsp; Patience, Firmness, and Perseverance were my only

<P>weapons; and these I resolved to use to the utmost.&nbsp; I determined

<P>always strictly to fulfil the threats and promises I made; and, to

<P>that end, I must be cautious to threaten and promise nothing that I

<P>could not perform.&nbsp; Then, I would carefully refrain from all

<P>useless irritability and indulgence of my own ill-temper:&nbsp; when

<P>they behaved tolerably, I would be as kind and obliging as it was

<P>in my power to be, in order to make the widest possible distinction

<P>between good and bad conduct; I would reason with them, too, in the

<P>simplest and most effective manner.&nbsp; When I reproved them, or

<P>refused to gratify their wishes, after a glaring fault, it should

<P>be more in sorrow than in anger:&nbsp; their little hymns and prayers
I

<P>would make plain and clear to their understanding; when they said

<P>their prayers at night and asked pardon for their offences, I would

<P>remind them of the sins of the past day, solemnly, but in perfect

<P>kindness, to avoid raising a spirit of opposition; penitential

<P>hymns should be said by the naughty, cheerful ones by the

<P>comparatively good; and every kind of instruction I would convey to

<P>them, as much as possible, by entertaining discourse - apparently

<P>with no other object than their present amusement in view.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By these means I hoped in time both to benefit the children and to

<P>gain the approbation of their parents; and also to convince my

<P>friends at home that I was not so wanting in skill and prudence as

<P>they supposed.&nbsp; I knew the difficulties I had to contend with were

<P>great; but I knew (at least I believed) unremitting patience and

<P>perseverance could overcome them; and night and morning I implored

<P>Divine assistance to this end.&nbsp; But either the children were so

<P>incorrigible, the parents so unreasonable, or myself so mistaken in

<P>my views, or so unable to carry them out, that my best intentions

<P>and most strenuous efforts seemed productive of no better result

<P>than sport to the children, dissatisfaction to their parents, and

<P>torment to myself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The task of instruction was as arduous for the body as the mind.&nbsp;
I

<P>had to run after my pupils to catch them, to carry or drag them to

<P>the table, and often forcibly to hold them there till the lesson

<P>was done.&nbsp; Tom I frequently put into a corner, seating myself

<P>before him in a chair, with a book which contained the little task

<P>that must be said or read, before he was released, in my hand.&nbsp;
He

<P>was not strong enough to push both me and the chair away, so he

<P>would stand twisting his body and face into the most grotesque and

<P>singular contortions - laughable, no doubt, to an unconcerned

<P>spectator, but not to me - and uttering loud yells and doleful

<P>outcries, intended to represent weeping but wholly without the

<P>accompaniment of tears.&nbsp; I knew this was done solely for the

<P>purpose of annoying me; and, therefore, however I might inwardly

<P>tremble with impatience and irritation, I manfully strove to

<P>suppress all visible signs of molestation, and affected to sit with

<P>calm indifference, waiting till it should please him to cease this

<P>pastime, and prepare for a run in the garden, by casting his eye on

<P>the book and reading or repeating the few words he was required to

<P>say.&nbsp; Sometimes he was determined to do his writing badly; and
I

<P>had to hold his hand to prevent him from purposely blotting or

<P>disfiguring the paper.&nbsp; Frequently I threatened that, if he did
not

<P>do better, he should have another line:&nbsp; then he would stubbornly

<P>refuse to write this line; and I, to save my word, had finally to

<P>resort to the expedient of holding his fingers upon the pen, and

<P>forcibly drawing his hand up and down, till, in spite of his

<P>resistance, the line was in some sort completed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yet Tom was by no means the most unmanageable of my pupils:

<P>sometimes, to my great joy, he would have the sense to see that his

<P>wisest policy was to finish his tasks, and go out and amuse himself

<P>till I and his sisters came to join him; which frequently was not

<P>at all, for Mary Ann seldom followed his example in this

<P>particular:&nbsp; she apparently preferred rolling on the floor to any

<P>other amusement:&nbsp; down she would drop like a leaden weight; and

<P>when I, with great difficulty, had succeeded in rooting her thence,

<P>I had still to hold her up with one arm, while with the other I

<P>held the book from which she was to read or spell her lesson.&nbsp;
As

<P>the dead weight of the big girl of six became too heavy for one arm

<P>to bear, I transferred it to the other; or, if both were weary of

<P>the burden, I carried her into a corner, and told her she might

<P>come out when she should find the use of her feet, and stand up:

<P>but she generally preferred lying there like a log till dinner or

<P>teatime, when, as I could not deprive her of her meals, she must be

<P>liberated, and would come crawling out with a grin of triumph on

<P>her round, red face.&nbsp; Often she would stubbornly refuse to

<P>pronounce some particular word in her lesson; and now I regret the

<P>lost labour I have had in striving to conquer her obstinacy.&nbsp; If
I

<P>had passed it over as a matter of no consequence, it would have

<P>been better for both parties, than vainly striving to overcome it

<P>as I did; but I thought it my absolute duty to crush this vicious

<P>tendency in the bud:&nbsp; and so it was, if I could have done it; and

<P>had my powers been less limited, I might have enforced obedience;

<P>but, as it was, it was a trial of strength between her and me, in

<P>which she generally came off victorious; and every victory served

<P>to encourage and strengthen her for a future contest.&nbsp; In vain
I

<P>argued, coaxed, entreated, threatened, scolded; in vain I kept her

<P>in from play, or, if obliged to take her out, refused to play with

<P>her, or to speak kindly or have anything to do with her; in vain I

<P>tried to set before her the advantages of doing as she was bid, and

<P>being loved, and kindly treated in consequence, and the

<P>disadvantages of persisting in her absurd perversity.&nbsp; Sometimes,

<P>when she would ask me to do something for her, I would answer, -

<P>'Yes, I will, Mary Ann, if you will only say that word.&nbsp; Come!

<P>you'd better say it at once, and have no more trouble about it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then, of course, I can do nothing for you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With me, at her age, or under, neglect and disgrace were the most

<P>dreadful of punishments; but on her they made no impression.

<P>Sometimes, exasperated to the utmost pitch, I would shake her

<P>violently by the shoulder, or pull her long hair, or put her in the

<P>corner; for which she punished me with loud, shrill, piercing

<P>screams, that went through my head like a knife.&nbsp; She knew I hated

<P>this, and when she had shrieked her utmost, would look into my face

<P>with an air of vindictive satisfaction, exclaiming, - 'NOW, then!

<P>THAT'S for you!' and then shriek again and again, till I was forced

<P>to stop my ears.&nbsp; Often these dreadful cries would bring Mrs.

<P>Bloomfield up to inquire what was the matter?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mary Ann is a naughty girl, ma'am.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But what are these shocking screams?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'She is screaming in a passion.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I never heard such a dreadful noise!&nbsp; You might be killing her.

<P>Why is she not out with her brother?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I cannot get her to finish her lessons.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But Mary Ann must be a GOOD girl, and finish her lessons.'&nbsp; This

<P>was blandly spoken to the child.&nbsp; 'And I hope I shall NEVER hear

<P>such terrible cries again!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And fixing her cold, stony eyes upon me with a look that could not

<P>be mistaken, she would shut the door, and walk away.&nbsp; Sometimes
I

<P>would try to take the little obstinate creature by surprise, and

<P>casually ask her the word while she was thinking of something else;

<P>frequently she would begin to say it, and then suddenly cheek

<P>herself, with a provoking look that seemed to say, 'Ah! I'm too

<P>sharp for you; you shan't trick it out of me, either.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On another occasion, I pretended to forget the whole affair; and

<P>talked and played with her as usual, till night, when I put her to

<P>bed; then bending over her, while she lay all smiles and good

<P>humour, just before departing, I said, as cheerfully and kindly as

<P>before - 'Now, Mary Ann, just tell me that word before I kiss you

<P>good-night.&nbsp; You are a good girl now, and, of course, you will
say

<P>it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, I won't.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then I can't kiss you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I don't care.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In vain I expressed my sorrow; in vain I lingered for some symptom

<P>of contrition; she really 'didn't care,' and I left her alone, and

<P>in darkness, wondering most of all at this last proof of insensate

<P>stubbornness.&nbsp; In MY childhood I could not imagine a more

<P>afflictive punishment than for my mother to refuse to kiss me at

<P>night:&nbsp; the very idea was terrible.&nbsp; More than the idea I
never

<P>felt, for, happily, I never committed a fault that was deemed

<P>worthy of such penalty; but once I remember, for some transgression

<P>of my sister's, our mother thought proper to inflict it upon her:

<P>what SHE felt, I cannot tell; but my sympathetic tears and

<P>suffering for her sake I shall not soon forget.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another troublesome trait in Mary Ann was her incorrigible

<P>propensity to keep running into the nursery, to play with her

<P>little sisters and the nurse.&nbsp; This was natural enough, but, as
it

<P>was against her mother's express desire, I, of course, forbade her

<P>to do so, and did my utmost to keep her with me; but that only

<P>increased her relish for the nursery, and the more I strove to keep

<P>her out of it, the oftener she went, and the longer she stayed, to

<P>the great dissatisfaction of Mrs. Bloomfield, who, I well knew,

<P>would impute all the blame of the matter to me.&nbsp; Another of my

<P>trials was the dressing in the morning:&nbsp; at one time she would
not

<P>be washed; at another she would not be dressed, unless she might

<P>wear some particular frock, that I knew her mother would not like

<P>her to have; at another she would scream and run away if I

<P>attempted to touch her hair.&nbsp; So that, frequently, when, after
much

<P>trouble and toil, I had, at length, succeeded in bringing her down,

<P>the breakfast was nearly half over; and black looks from 'mamma,'

<P>and testy observations from 'papa,' spoken at me, if not to me,

<P>were sure to be my meed:&nbsp; for few things irritated the latter so

<P>much as want of punctuality at meal times.&nbsp; Then, among the minor

<P>annoyances, was my inability to satisfy Mrs. Bloomfield with her

<P>daughter's dress; and the child's hair 'was never fit to be seen.'

<P>Sometimes, as a powerful reproach to me, she would perform the

<P>office of tire woman herself, and then complain bitterly of the

<P>trouble it gave her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When little Fanny came into the schoolroom, I hoped she would be

<P>mild and inoffensive, at least; but a few days, if not a few hours,

<P>sufficed to destroy the illusion:&nbsp; I found her a mischievous,

<P>intractable little creature, given up to falsehood and deception,

<P>young as she was, and alarmingly fond of exercising her two

<P>favourite weapons of offence and defence:&nbsp; that of spitting in
the

<P>faces of those who incurred her displeasure, and bellowing like a

<P>bull when her unreasonable desires were not gratified.&nbsp; As she,

<P>generally, was pretty quiet in her parents' presence, and they were

<P>impressed with the notion of her being a remarkably gentle child,

<P>her falsehoods were readily believed, and her loud uproars led them

<P>to suspect harsh and injudicious treatment on my part; and when, at

<P>length, her bad disposition became manifest even to their

<P>prejudiced eyes, I felt that the whole was attributed to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What a naughty girl Fanny is getting!' Mrs. Bloomfield would say

<P>to her spouse.&nbsp; 'Don't you observe, my dear, how she is altered

<P>since she entered the schoolroom?&nbsp; She will soon be as bad as the

<P>other two; and, I am sorry to say, they have quite deteriorated of

<P>late.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You may say that,' was the answer.&nbsp; 'I've been thinking that same

<P>myself.&nbsp; I thought when we got them a governess they'd improve;

<P>but, instead of that, they get worse and worse:&nbsp; I don't know how

<P>it is with their learning, but their habits, I know, make no sort

<P>of improvement; they get rougher, and dirtier, and more unseemly

<P>every day.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I knew this was all pointed at me; and these, and all similar

<P>innuendoes, affected me far more deeply than any open accusations

<P>would have done; for against the latter I should have been roused

<P>to speak in my own defence:&nbsp; now I judged it my wisest plan to

<P>subdue every resentful impulse, suppress every sensitive shrinking,

<P>and go on perseveringly, doing my best; for, irksome as my

<P>situation was, I earnestly wished to retain it.&nbsp; I thought, if
I

<P>could struggle on with unremitting firmness and integrity, the

<P>children would in time become more humanized:&nbsp; every month would

<P>contribute to make them some little wiser, and, consequently, more

<P>manageable; for a child of nine or ten as frantic and ungovernable

<P>as these at six and seven would be a maniac.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I flattered myself I was benefiting my parents and sister by my

<P>continuance here; for small as the salary was, I still was earning

<P>something, and with strict economy I could easily manage to have

<P>something to spare for them, if they would favour me by taking it.

<P>Then it was by my own will that I had got the place:&nbsp; I had brought

<P>all this tribulation on myself, and I was determined to bear it;

<P>nay, more than that, I did not even regret the step I had taken.&nbsp;
I

<P>longed to show my friends that, even now, I was competent to

<P>undertake the charge, and able to acquit myself honourably to the

<P>end; and if ever I felt it degrading to submit so quietly, or

<P>intolerable to toil so constantly, I would turn towards my home,

<P>and say within myself -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They may crush, but they shall not subdue me!

<P>'Tis of thee that I think, not of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>About Christmas I was allowed to visit home; but my holiday was

<P>only of a fortnight's duration:&nbsp; 'For,' said Mrs. Bloomfield, 'I

<P>thought, as you had seen your friends so lately, you would not care

<P>for a longer stay.'&nbsp; I left her to think so still:&nbsp; but she
little

<P>knew how long, how wearisome those fourteen weeks of absence had

<P>been to me; how intensely I had longed for my holidays, how greatly

<P>I was disappointed at their curtailment.&nbsp; Yet she was not to blame

<P>in this.&nbsp; I had never told her my feelings, and she could not be

<P>expected to divine them; I had not been with her a full term, and

<P>she was justified in not allowing me a full vacation.
