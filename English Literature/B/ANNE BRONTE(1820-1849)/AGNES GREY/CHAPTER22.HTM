<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>ASHBY PARK was certainly a very delightful residence.&nbsp; The mansion

<P>was stately without, commodious and elegant within; the park was

<P>spacious and beautiful, chiefly on account of its magnificent old

<P>trees, its stately herds of deer, its broad sheet of water, and the

<P>ancient woods that stretched beyond it:&nbsp; for there was no broken

<P>ground to give variety to the landscape, and but very little of

<P>that undulating swell which adds so greatly to the charm of park

<P>scenery.&nbsp; And so, this was the place Rosalie Murray had so longed

<P>to call her own, that she must have a share of it, on whatever

<P>terms it might be offered - whatever price was to be paid for the

<P>title of mistress, and whoever was to be her partner in the honour

<P>and bliss of such a possession!&nbsp; Well I am not disposed to censure

<P>her now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She received me very kindly; and, though I was a poor clergyman's

<P>daughter, a governess, and a schoolmistress, she welcomed me with

<P>unaffected pleasure to her home; and - what surprised me rather -

<P>took some pains to make my visit agreeable.&nbsp; I could see, it is

<P>true, that she expected me to be greatly struck with the

<P>magnificence that surrounded her; and, I confess, I was rather

<P>annoyed at her evident efforts to reassure me, and prevent me from

<P>being overwhelmed by so much grandeur - too much awed at the idea

<P>of encountering her husband and mother-in-law, or too much ashamed

<P>of my own humble appearance.&nbsp; I was not ashamed of it at all; for,

<P>though plain, I had taken good care not to shabby or mean, and

<P>should have been pretty considerably at my ease, if my

<P>condescending hostess had not taken such manifest pains to make me

<P>so; and, as for the magnificence that surrounded her, nothing that

<P>met my eyes struck me or affected me half so much as her own

<P>altered appearance.&nbsp; Whether from the influence of fashionable

<P>dissipation, or some other evil, a space of little more than twelve

<P>months had had the effect that might be expected from as many

<P>years, in reducing the plumpness of her form, the freshness of her

<P>complexion, the vivacity of her movements, and the exuberance of

<P>her spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I wished to know if she was unhappy; but I felt it was not my

<P>province to inquire:&nbsp; I might endeavour to win her confidence;
but,

<P>if she chose to conceal her matrimonial cares from me, I would

<P>trouble her with no obtrusive questions.&nbsp; I, therefore, at first,

<P>confined myself to a few general inquiries about her health and

<P>welfare, and a few commendations on the beauty of the park, and of

<P>the little girl that should have been a boy:&nbsp; a small delicate

<P>infant of seven or eight weeks old, whom its mother seemed to

<P>regard with no remarkable degree of interest or affection, though

<P>full as much as I expected her to show.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shortly after my arrival, she commissioned her maid to conduct me

<P>to my room and see that I had everything I wanted; it was a small,

<P>unpretending, but sufficiently comfortable apartment.&nbsp; When I

<P>descended thence - having divested myself of all travelling

<P>encumbrances, and arranged my toilet with due consideration for the

<P>feelings of my lady hostess, she conducted me herself to the room I

<P>was to occupy when I chose to be alone, or when she was engaged

<P>with visitors, or obliged to be with her mother-in-law, or

<P>otherwise prevented, as she said, from enjoying the pleasure of my

<P>society.&nbsp; It was a quiet, tidy little sitting-room; and I was not

<P>sorry to be provided with such a harbour of refuge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And some time,' said she, 'I will show you the library:&nbsp; I never

<P>examined its shelves, but, I daresay, it is full of wise books; and

<P>you may go and burrow among them whenever you please.&nbsp; And now
you

<P>shall have some tea - it will soon be dinner-time, but I thought,

<P>as you were accustomed to dine at one, you would perhaps like

<P>better to have a cup of tea about this time, and to dine when we

<P>lunch:&nbsp; and then, you know, you can have your tea in this room,
and

<P>that will save you from having to dine with Lady Ashby and Sir

<P>Thomas:&nbsp; which would be rather awkward - at least, not awkward,
but

<P>rather - a - you know what I mean.&nbsp; I thought you mightn't like
it

<P>so well - especially as we may have other ladies and gentlemen to

<P>dine with us occasionally.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Certainly,' said I, 'I would much rather have it as you say, and,

<P>if you have no objection, I should prefer having all my meals in

<P>this room.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why so?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Because, I imagine, it would be more agreeable to Lady Ashby and

<P>Sir Thomas.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Nothing of the kind.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'At any rate it would be more agreeable to me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She made some faint objections, but soon conceded; and I could see

<P>that the proposal was a considerable relief to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, come into the drawing-room,' said she.&nbsp; 'There's the dressing

<P>bell; but I won't go yet:&nbsp; it's no use dressing when there's no
one

<P>to see you; and I want to have a little discourse.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The drawing-room was certainly an imposing apartment, and very

<P>elegantly furnished; but I saw its young mistress glance towards me

<P>as we entered, as if to notice how I was impressed by the

<P>spectacle, and accordingly I determined to preserve an aspect of

<P>stony indifference, as if I saw nothing at all remarkable.&nbsp; But

<P>this was only for a moment:&nbsp; immediately conscience whispered,
'Why

<P>should I disappoint her to save my pride?&nbsp; No - rather let me

<P>sacrifice my pride to give her a little innocent gratification.'

<P>And I honestly looked round, and told her it was a noble room, and

<P>very tastefully furnished.&nbsp; She said little, but I saw she was

<P>pleased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She showed me her fat French poodle, that lay curled up on a silk

<P>cushion, and the two fine Italian paintings:&nbsp; which, however, she

<P>would not give me time to examine, but, saying I must look at them

<P>some other day, insisted upon my admiring the little jewelled watch

<P>she had purchased in Geneva; and then she took me round the room to

<P>point out sundry articles of VERTU she had brought from Italy:&nbsp;
an

<P>elegant little timepiece, and several busts, small graceful

<P>figures, and vases, all beautifully carved in white marble.&nbsp; She

<P>spoke of these with animation, and heard my admiring comments with

<P>a smile of pleasure:&nbsp; that soon, however, vanished, and was

<P>followed by a melancholy sigh; as if in consideration of the

<P>insufficiency of all such baubles to the happiness of the human

<P>heart, and their woeful inability to supply its insatiate demands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, stretching herself upon a couch, she motioned me to a

<P>capacious easy-chair that stood opposite - not before the fire, but

<P>before a wide open window; for it was summer, be it remembered; a

<P>sweet, warm evening in the latter half of June.&nbsp; I sat for a moment

<P>in silence, enjoying the still, pure air, and the delightful

<P>prospect of the park that lay before me, rich in verdure and

<P>foliage, and basking in yellow sunshine, relieved by the long

<P>shadows of declining day.&nbsp; But I must take advantage of this pause:

<P>I had inquiries to make, and, like the substance of a lady's

<P>postscript, the most important must come last.&nbsp; So I began with

<P>asking after Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and Miss Matilda and the young

<P>gentlemen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was told that papa had the gout, which made him very ferocious;

<P>and that he would not give up his choice wines, and his substantial

<P>dinners and suppers, and had quarrelled with his physician, because

<P>the latter had dared to say that no medicine could cure him while

<P>he lived so freely; that mamma and the rest were well.&nbsp; Matilda
was

<P>still wild and reckless, but she had got a fashionable governess,

<P>and was considerably improved in her manners, and soon to be

<P>introduced to the world; and John and Charles (now at home for the

<P>holidays) were, by all accounts, 'fine, bold, unruly, mischievous

<P>boys.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And how are the other people getting on?' said I - 'the Greens,

<P>for instance?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ah! Mr. Green is heart-broken, you know,' replied she, with a

<P>languid smile:&nbsp; 'he hasn't got over his disappointment yet, and

<P>never will, I suppose.&nbsp; He's doomed to be an old bachelor; and
his

<P>sisters are doing their best to get married.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And the Melthams?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, they're jogging on as usual, I suppose:&nbsp; but I know very

<P>little about any of them - except Harry,' said she, blushing

<P>slightly, and smiling again.&nbsp; 'I saw a great deal of him while
we

<P>were in London; for, as soon as he heard we were there, he came up

<P>under pretence of visiting his brother, and either followed me,

<P>like a shadow, wherever I went, or met me, like a reflection, at

<P>every turn.&nbsp; You needn't look so shocked, Miss Grey; I was very

<P>discreet, I assure you, but, you know, one can't help being

<P>admired.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; He was not my only worshipper; though
he

<P>was certainly the most conspicuous, and, I think, the most devoted

<P>among them all.&nbsp; And that detestable - ahem - and Sir Thomas chose

<P>to take offence at him - or my profuse expenditure, or something -

<P>I don't exactly know what - and hurried me down to the country at a

<P>moment's notice; where I'm to play the hermit, I suppose, for

<P>life.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And she bit her lip, and frowned vindictively upon the fair domain

<P>she had once so coveted to call her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And Mr. Hatfield,' said I, 'what is become of him?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again she brightened up, and answered gaily - 'Oh! he made up to an

<P>elderly spinster, and married her, not long since; weighing her

<P>heavy purse against her faded charms, and expecting to find that

<P>solace in gold which was denied him in love - ha, ha!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, and I think that's all - except Mr. Weston:&nbsp; what is he

<P>doing?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know, I'm sure.&nbsp; He's gone from Horton.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How long since? and where is he gone to?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I know nothing about him,' replied she, yawning - 'except that he

<P>went about a month ago - I never asked where' (I would have asked

<P>whether it was to a living or merely another curacy, but thought it

<P>better not); 'and the people made a great rout about his leaving,'

<P>continued she, 'much to Mr. Hatfield's displeasure; for Hatfield

<P>didn't like him, because he had too much influence with the common

<P>people, and because he was not sufficiently tractable and

<P>submissive to him - and for some other unpardonable sins, I don't

<P>know what.&nbsp; But now I positively must go and dress:&nbsp; the second

<P>bell will ring directly, and if I come to dinner in this guise, I

<P>shall never hear the end of it from Lady Ashby.&nbsp; It's a strange

<P>thing one can't be mistress in one's own house!&nbsp; Just ring the

<P>bell, and I'll send for my maid, and tell them to get you some tea.

<P>Only think of that intolerable woman - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Who - your maid?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; - my mother-in-law - and my unfortunate mistake!&nbsp; Instead
of

<P>letting her take herself off to some other house, as she offered to

<P>do when I married, I was fool enough to ask her to live here still,

<P>and direct the affairs of the house for me; because, in the first

<P>place, I hoped we should spend the greater part of the year, in

<P>town, and in the second place, being so young and inexperienced, I

<P>was frightened at the idea of having a houseful of servants to

<P>manage, and dinners to order, and parties to entertain, and all the

<P>rest of it, and I thought she might assist me with her experience;

<P>never dreaming she would prove a usurper, a tyrant, an incubus, a

<P>spy, and everything else that's detestable.&nbsp; I wish she was dead!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She then turned to give her orders to the footman, who had been

<P>standing bolt upright within the door for the last half minute, and

<P>had heard the latter part of her animadversions; and, of course,

<P>made his own reflections upon them, notwithstanding the inflexible,

<P>wooden countenance he thought proper to preserve in the drawing-

<P>room.&nbsp; On my remarking afterwards that he must have heard her,
she

<P>replied - 'Oh, no matter!&nbsp; I never care about the footmen; they're

<P>mere automatons:&nbsp; it's nothing to them what their superiors say
or

<P>do; they won't dare to repeat it; and as to what they think - if

<P>they presume to think at all - of course, nobody cares for that.

<P>It would be a pretty thing indeed, it we were to be tongue-tied by

<P>our servants!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So saying, she ran off to make her hasty toilet, leaving me to

<P>pilot my way back to my sitting-room, where, in due time, I was

<P>served with a cup of tea.&nbsp; After that, I sat musing on Lady Ashby's

<P>past and present condition; and on what little information I had

<P>obtained respecting Mr. Weston, and the small chance there was of

<P>ever seeing or hearing anything more of him throughout my quiet,

<P>drab-colour life:&nbsp; which, henceforth, seemed to offer no

<P>alternative between positive rainy days, and days of dull grey

<P>clouds without downfall.&nbsp; At length, however, I began to weary
of

<P>my thoughts, and to wish I knew where to find the library my

<P>hostess had spoken of; and to wonder whether I was to remain there

<P>doing nothing till bedtime.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As I was not rich enough to possess a watch, I could not tell how

<P>time was passing, except by observing the slowly lengthening

<P>shadows from the window; which presented a side view, including a

<P>corner of the park, a clump of trees whose topmost branches had

<P>been colonized by an innumerable company of noisy rooks, and a high

<P>wall with a massive wooden gate:&nbsp; no doubt communicating with the

<P>stable-yard, as a broad carriage-road swept up to it from the park.

<P>The shadow of this wall soon took posession of the whole of the

<P>ground as far as I could see, forcing the golden sunlight to

<P>retreat inch by inch, and at last take refuge in the very tops of

<P>the trees.&nbsp; Ere long, even they were left in shadow - the shadow
of

<P>the distant hills, or of the earth itself; and, in sympathy for the

<P>busy citizens of the rookery, I regretted to see their habitation,

<P>so lately bathed in glorious light, reduced to the sombre, work-a-

<P>day hue of the lower world, or of my own world within.&nbsp; For a

<P>moment, such birds as soared above the rest might still receive the

<P>lustre on their wings, which imparted to their sable plumage the

<P>hue and brilliance of deep red gold; at last, that too departed.

<P>Twilight came stealing on; the rooks became more quiet; I became

<P>more weary, and wished I were going home to-morrow.&nbsp; At length
it

<P>grew dark; and I was thinking of ringing for a candle, and betaking

<P>myself to bed, when my hostess appeared, with many apologies for

<P>having neglected me so long, and laying all the blame upon that

<P>'nasty old woman,' as she called her mother-in-law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'If I didn't sit with her in the drawing-room while Sir Thomas is

<P>taking his wine,' said she, 'she would never forgive me; and then,

<P>if I leave the room the instant he comes - as I have done once or

<P>twice - it is an unpardonable offence against her dear Thomas.&nbsp;
SHE

<P>never showed such disrespect to HER husband:&nbsp; and as for affection,

<P>wives never think of that now-a-days, she supposes:&nbsp; but things

<P>were different in HER time - as if there was any good to be done by

<P>staying in the room, when he does nothing but grumble and scold

<P>when he's in a bad humour, talk disgusting nonsense when he's in a

<P>good one, and go to sleep on the sofa when he's too stupid for

<P>either; which is most frequently the case now, when he has nothing

<P>to do but to sot over his wine.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But could you not try to occupy his mind with something better;

<P>and engage him to give up such habits?&nbsp; I'm sure you have powers
of

<P>persuasion, and qualifications for amusing a gentleman, which many

<P>ladies would be glad to possess.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And so you think I would lay myself out for his amusement!&nbsp; No:

<P>that's not MY idea of a wife.&nbsp; It's the husband's part to please

<P>the wife, not hers to please him; and if he isn't satisfied with

<P>her as she is - and thankful to possess her too - he isn't worthy

<P>of her, that's all.&nbsp; And as for persuasion, I assure you I shan't

<P>trouble myself with that:&nbsp; I've enough to do to bear with him as
he

<P>is, without attempting to work a reform.&nbsp; But I'm sorry I left
you

<P>so long alone, Miss Grey.&nbsp; How have you passed the time?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Chiefly in watching the rooks.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mercy, how dull you must have been!&nbsp; I really must show you the

<P>library; and you must ring for everything you want, just as you

<P>would in an inn, and make yourself comfortable.&nbsp; I have selfish

<P>reasons for wishing to make you happy, because I want you to stay

<P>with me, and not fulfil your horrid threat of running away in a day

<P>or two.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, don't let me keep you out of the drawing-room any longer to-

<P>night, for at present I am tired and wish to go to bed.'
