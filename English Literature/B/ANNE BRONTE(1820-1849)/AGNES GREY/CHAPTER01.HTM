<P>ALL true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the

<P>treasure may be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in

<P>quantity, that the dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for

<P>the trouble of cracking the nut.&nbsp; Whether this be the case with
my

<P>history or not, I am hardly competent to judge.&nbsp; I sometimes think

<P>it might prove useful to some, and entertaining to others; but the

<P>world may judge for itself.&nbsp; Shielded by my own obscurity, and
by

<P>the lapse of years, and a few fictitious names, I do not fear to

<P>venture; and will candidly lay before the public what I would not

<P>disclose to the most intimate friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My father was a clergyman of the north of England, who was

<P>deservedly respected by all who knew him; and, in his younger days,

<P>lived pretty comfortably on the joint income of a small incumbency

<P>and a snug little property of his own.&nbsp; My mother, who married
him

<P>against the wishes of her friends, was a squire's daughter, and a

<P>woman of spirit.&nbsp; In vain it was represented to her, that if she

<P>became the poor parson's wife, she must relinquish her carriage and

<P>her lady's-maid, and all the luxuries and elegancies of affluence;

<P>which to her were little less than the necessaries of life.&nbsp; A

<P>carriage and a lady's-maid were great conveniences; but, thank

<P>heaven, she had feet to carry her, and hands to minister to her own

<P>necessities.&nbsp; An elegant house and spacious grounds were not to
be

<P>despised; but she would rather live in a cottage with Richard Grey

<P>than in a palace with any other man in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Finding arguments of no avail, her father, at length, told the

<P>lovers they might marry if they pleased; but, in so doing, his

<P>daughter would forfeit every fraction of her fortune.&nbsp; He expected

<P>this would cool the ardour of both; but he was mistaken.&nbsp; My father

<P>knew too well my mother's superior worth not to be sensible that

<P>she was a valuable fortune in herself:&nbsp; and if she would but

<P>consent to embellish his humble hearth he should be happy to take

<P>her on any terms; while she, on her part, would rather labour with

<P>her own hands than be divided from the man she loved, whose

<P>happiness it would be her joy to make, and who was already one with

<P>her in heart and soul.&nbsp; So her fortune went to swell the purse
of a

<P>wiser sister, who had married a rich nabob; and she, to the wonder

<P>and compassionate regret of all who knew her, went to bury herself

<P>in the homely village parsonage among the hills of -.&nbsp; And yet,
in

<P>spite of all this, and in spite of my mother's high spirit and my

<P>father's whims, I believe you might search all England through, and

<P>fail to find a happier couple.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of six children, my sister Mary and myself were the only two that

<P>survived the perils of infancy and early childhood.&nbsp; I, being the

<P>younger by five or six years, was always regarded as THE child, and

<P>the pet of the family:&nbsp; father, mother, and sister, all combined
to

<P>spoil me - not by foolish indulgence, to render me fractious and

<P>ungovernable, but by ceaseless kindness, to make me too helpless

<P>and dependent - too unfit for buffeting with the cares and turmoils

<P>of life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary and I were brought up in the strictest seclusion.&nbsp; My mother,

<P>being at once highly accomplished, well informed, and fond of

<P>employment, took the whole charge of our education on herself, with

<P>the exception of Latin - which my father undertook to teach us - so

<P>that we never even went to school; and, as there was no society in

<P>the neighbourhood, our only intercourse with the world consisted in

<P>a stately tea-party, now and then, with the principal farmers and

<P>tradespeople of the vicinity (just to avoid being stigmatized as

<P>too proud to consort with our neighbours), and an annual visit to

<P>our paternal grandfather's; where himself, our kind grandmamma, a

<P>maiden aunt, and two or three elderly ladies and gentlemen, were

<P>the only persons we ever saw.&nbsp; Sometimes our mother would amuse
us

<P>with stories and anecdotes of her younger days, which, while they

<P>entertained us amazingly, frequently awoke - in ME, at least - a

<P>secret wish to see a little more of the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I thought she must have been very happy:&nbsp; but she never seemed
to

<P>regret past times.&nbsp; My father, however, whose temper was neither

<P>tranquil nor cheerful by nature, often unduly vexed himself with

<P>thinking of the sacrifices his dear wife had made for him; and

<P>troubled his head with revolving endless schemes for the

<P>augmentation of his little fortune, for her sake and ours.&nbsp; In
vain

<P>my mother assured him she was quite satisfied; and if he would but

<P>lay by a little for the children, we should all have plenty, both

<P>for time present and to come:&nbsp; but saving was not my father's

<P>forte.&nbsp; He would not run in debt (at least, my mother took good

<P>care he should not), but while he had money he must spend it:&nbsp;
he

<P>liked to see his house comfortable, and his wife and daughters well

<P>clothed, and well attended; and besides, he was charitably

<P>disposed, and liked to give to the poor, according to his means:

<P>or, as some might think, beyond them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At length, however, a kind friend suggested to him a means of

<P>doubling his private property at one stroke; and further increasing

<P>it, hereafter, to an untold amount.&nbsp; This friend was a merchant,
a

<P>man of enterprising spirit and undoubted talent, who was somewhat

<P>straitened in his mercantile pursuits for want of capital; but

<P>generously proposed to give my father a fair share of his profits,

<P>if he would only entrust him with what he could spare; and he

<P>thought he might safely promise that whatever sum the latter chose

<P>to put into his hands, it should bring him in cent. per cent.&nbsp;
The

<P>small patrimony was speedily sold, and the whole of its price was

<P>deposited in the hands of the friendly merchant; who as promptly

<P>proceeded to ship his cargo, and prepare for his voyage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My father was delighted, so were we all, with our brightening

<P>prospects.&nbsp; For the present, it is true, we were reduced to the

<P>narrow income of the curacy; but my father seemed to think there

<P>was no necessity for scrupulously restricting our expenditure to

<P>that; so, with a standing bill at Mr. Jackson's, another at

<P>Smith's, and a third at Hobson's, we got along even more

<P>comfortably than before:&nbsp; though my mother affirmed we had better

<P>keep within bounds, for our prospects of wealth were but

<P>precarious, after all; and if my father would only trust everything

<P>to her management, he should never feel himself stinted:&nbsp; but he,

<P>for once, was incorrigible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What happy hours Mary and I have passed while sitting at our work

<P>by the fire, or wandering on the heath-clad hills, or idling under

<P>the weeping birch (the only considerable tree in the garden),

<P>talking of future happiness to ourselves and our parents, of what

<P>we would do, and see, and possess; with no firmer foundation for

<P>our goodly superstructure than the riches that were expected to

<P>flow in upon us from the success of the worthy merchant's

<P>speculations.&nbsp; Our father was nearly as bad as ourselves; only
that

<P>he affected not to be so much in earnest:&nbsp; expressing his bright

<P>hopes and sanguine expectations in jests and playful sallies, that

<P>always struck me as being exceedingly witty and pleasant.&nbsp; Our

<P>mother laughed with delight to see him so hopeful and happy:&nbsp; but

<P>still she feared he was setting his heart too much upon the matter;

<P>and once I heard her whisper as she left the room, 'God grant he be

<P>not disappointed!&nbsp; I know not how he would bear it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Disappointed he was; and bitterly, too.&nbsp; It came like a thunder-

<P>clap on us all, that the vessel which contained our fortune had

<P>been wrecked, and gone to the bottom with all its stores, together

<P>with several of the crew, and the unfortunate merchant himself.&nbsp;
I

<P>was grieved for him; I was grieved for the overthrow of all our

<P>air-built castles:&nbsp; but, with the elasticity of youth, I soon

<P>recovered the shook.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though riches had charms, poverty had no terrors for an

<P>inexperienced girl like me.&nbsp; Indeed, to say the truth, there was

<P>something exhilarating in the idea of being driven to straits, and

<P>thrown upon our own resources.&nbsp; I only wished papa, mamma, and
Mary

<P>were all of the same mind as myself; and then, instead of lamenting

<P>past calamities we might all cheerfully set to work to remedy them;

<P>and the greater the difficulties, the harder our present

<P>privations, the greater should be our cheerfulness to endure the

<P>latter, and our vigour to contend against the former.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary did not lament, but she brooded continually over the

<P>misfortune, and sank into a state of dejection from which no effort

<P>of mine could rouse her.&nbsp; I could not possibly bring her to regard

<P>the matter on its bright side as I did:&nbsp; and indeed I was so

<P>fearful of being charged with childish frivolity, or stupid

<P>insensibility, that I carefully kept most of my bright ideas and

<P>cheering notions to myself; well knowing they could not be

<P>appreciated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My mother thought only of consoling my father, and paying our debts

<P>and retrenching our expenditure by every available means; but my

<P>father was completely overwhelmed by the calamity:&nbsp; health,

<P>strength, and spirits sank beneath the blow, and he never wholly

<P>recovered them.&nbsp; In vain my mother strove to cheer him, by

<P>appealing to his piety, to his courage, to his affection for

<P>herself and us.&nbsp; That very affection was his greatest torment:&nbsp;
it

<P>was for our sakes he had so ardently longed to increase his fortune

<P>- it was our interest that had lent such brightness to his hopes,

<P>and that imparted such bitterness to his present distress.&nbsp; He
now

<P>tormented himself with remorse at having neglected my mother's

<P>advice; which would at least have saved him from the additional

<P>burden of debt - he vainly reproached himself for having brought

<P>her from the dignity, the ease, the luxury of her former station to

<P>toil with him through the cares and toils of poverty.&nbsp; It was gall

<P>and wormwood to his soul to see that splendid, highly-accomplished

<P>woman, once so courted and admired, transformed into an active

<P>managing housewife, with hands and head continually occupied with

<P>household labours and household economy.&nbsp; The very willingness
with

<P>which she performed these duties, the cheerfulness with which she

<P>bore her reverses, and the kindness which withheld her from

<P>imputing the smallest blame to him, were all perverted by this

<P>ingenious self-tormentor into further aggravations of his

<P>sufferings.&nbsp; And thus the mind preyed upon the body, and disordered

<P>the system of the nerves, and they in turn increased the troubles

<P>of the mind, till by action and reaction his health was seriously

<P>impaired; and not one of us could convince him that the aspect of

<P>our affairs was not half so gloomy, so utterly hopeless, as his

<P>morbid imagination represented it to be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The useful pony phaeton was sold, together with the stout, well-fed

<P>pony - the old favourite that we had fully determined should end

<P>its days in peace, and never pass from our hands; the little coach-

<P>house and stable were let; the servant boy, and the more efficient

<P>(being the more expensive) of the two maid-servants, were

<P>dismissed.&nbsp; Our clothes were mended, turned, and darned to the

<P>utmost verge of decency; our food, always plain, was now simplified

<P>to an unprecedented degree - except my father's favourite dishes;

<P>our coals and candles were painfully economized - the pair of

<P>candles reduced to one, and that most sparingly used; the coals

<P>carefully husbanded in the half-empty grate:&nbsp; especially when my

<P>father was out on his parish duties, or confined to bed through

<P>illness - then we sat with our feet on the fender, scraping the

<P>perishing embers together from time to time, and occasionally

<P>adding a slight scattering of the dust and fragments of coal, just

<P>to keep them alive.&nbsp; As for our carpets, they in time were worn

<P>threadbare, and patched and darned even to a greater extent than

<P>our garments.&nbsp; To save the expense of a gardener, Mary and I

<P>undertook to keep the garden in order; and all the cooking and

<P>household work that could not easily be managed by one servant-

<P>girl, was done by my mother and sister, with a little occasional

<P>help from me:&nbsp; only a little, because, though a woman in my own

<P>estimation, I was still a child in theirs; and my mother, like most

<P>active, managing women, was not gifted with very active daughters:

<P>for this reason - that being so clever and diligent herself, she

<P>was never tempted to trust her affairs to a deputy, but, on the

<P>contrary, was willing to act and think for others as well as for

<P>number one; and whatever was the business in hand, she was apt to

<P>think that no one could do it so well as herself:&nbsp; so that whenever

<P>I offered to assist her, I received such an answer as - 'No, love,

<P>you cannot indeed - there's nothing here you can do.&nbsp; Go and help

<P>your sister, or get her to take a walk with you - tell her she must

<P>not sit so much, and stay so constantly in the house as she does -

<P>she may well look thin and dejected.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mary, mamma says I'm to help you; or get you to take a walk with

<P>me; she says you may well look thin and dejected, if you sit so

<P>constantly in the house.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Help me you cannot, Agnes; and I cannot go out with YOU - I have

<P>far too much to do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then let me help you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You cannot, indeed, dear child.&nbsp; Go and practise your music, or

<P>play with the kitten.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was always plenty of sewing on hand; but I had not been

<P>taught to cut out a single garment, and except plain hemming and

<P>seaming, there was little I could do, even in that line; for they

<P>both asserted that it was far easier to do the work themselves than

<P>to prepare it for me:&nbsp; and besides, they liked better to see me

<P>prosecuting my studies, or amusing myself - it was time enough for

<P>me to sit bending over my work, like a grave matron, when my

<P>favourite little pussy was become a steady old cat.&nbsp; Under such

<P>circumstances, although I was not many degrees more useful than the

<P>kitten, my idleness was not entirely without excuse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Through all our troubles, I never but once heard my mother complain

<P>of our want of money.&nbsp; As summer was coming on she observed to
Mary

<P>and me, 'What a desirable thing it would be for your papa to spend

<P>a few weeks at a watering-place.&nbsp; I am convinced the sea-air and

<P>the change of scene would be of incalculable service to him.&nbsp; But

<P>then, you see, there's no money,' she added, with a sigh.&nbsp; We both

<P>wished exceedingly that the thing might be done, and lamented

<P>greatly that it could not.&nbsp; 'Well, well!' said she, 'it's no use

<P>complaining.&nbsp; Possibly something might be done to further the

<P>project after all.&nbsp; Mary, you are a beautiful drawer.&nbsp; What
do you

<P>say to doing a few more pictures in your best style, and getting

<P>them framed, with the water-coloured drawings you have already

<P>done, and trying to dispose of them to some liberal picture-dealer,

<P>who has the sense to discern their merits?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mamma, I should be delighted if you think they COULD be sold; and

<P>for anything worth while.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It's worth while trying, however, my dear:&nbsp; do you procure the

<P>drawings, and I'll endeavour to find a purchaser.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I wish I could do something,' said I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You, Agnes! well, who knows?&nbsp; You draw pretty well, too:&nbsp;
if you

<P>choose some simple piece for your subject, I daresay you will be

<P>able to produce something we shall all be proud to exhibit.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But I have another scheme in my head, mamma, and have had long,

<P>only I did not like to mention it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Indeed! pray tell us what it is.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I should like to be a governess.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My mother uttered an exclamation of surprise, and laughed.&nbsp; My

<P>sister dropped her work in astonishment, exclaiming, 'YOU a

<P>governess, Agnes!&nbsp; What can you be dreaming of?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well!&nbsp; I don't see anything so VERY extraordinary in it.&nbsp;
I do not

<P>pretend to be able to instruct great girls; but surely I could

<P>teach little ones:&nbsp; and I should like it so much:&nbsp; I am so
fond of

<P>children.&nbsp; Do let me, mamma!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, my love, you have not learned to take care of YOURSELF yet:

<P>and young children require more judgment and experience to manage

<P>than elder ones.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, mamma, I am above eighteen, and quite able to take care of

<P>myself, and others too.&nbsp; You do not know half the wisdom and

<P>prudence I possess, because I have never been tried.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Only think,' said Mary, 'what would you do in a house full of

<P>strangers, without me or mamma to speak and act for you - with a

<P>parcel of children, besides yourself, to attend to; and no one to

<P>look to for advice?&nbsp; You would not even know what clothes to put

<P>on.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You think, because I always do as you bid me, I have no judgment

<P>of my own:&nbsp; but only try me - that is all I ask - and you shall
see

<P>what I can do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At that moment my father entered and the subject of our discussion

<P>was explained to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What, my little Agnes a governess!' cried he, and, in spite of his

<P>dejection, he laughed at the idea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, papa, don't YOU say anything against it:&nbsp; I should like it
so

<P>much; and I am sure I could manage delightfully.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, my darling, we could not spare you.'&nbsp; And a tear glistened
in

<P>his eye as he added - 'No, no! afflicted as we are, surely we are

<P>not brought to that pass yet.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, no!' said my mother.&nbsp; 'There is no necessity whatever for
such

<P>a step; it is merely a whim of her own.&nbsp; So you must hold your

<P>tongue, you naughty girl; for, though you are so ready to leave us,

<P>you know very well we cannot part with YOU.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was silenced for that day, and for many succeeding ones; but

<P>still I did not wholly relinquish my darling scheme.&nbsp; Mary got
her

<P>drawing materials, and steadily set to work.&nbsp; I got mine too; but

<P>while I drew, I thought of other things.&nbsp; How delightful it would

<P>be to be a governess!&nbsp; To go out into the world; to enter upon
a

<P>new life; to act for myself; to exercise my unused faculties; to

<P>try my unknown powers; to earn my own maintenance, and something to

<P>comfort and help my father, mother, and sister, besides exonerating

<P>them from the provision of my food and clothing; to show papa what

<P>his little Agnes could do; to convince mamma and Mary that I was

<P>not quite the helpless, thoughtless being they supposed.&nbsp; And then,

<P>how charming to be entrusted with the care and education of

<P>children!&nbsp; Whatever others said, I felt I was fully competent to

<P>the task:&nbsp; the clear remembrance of my own thoughts in early

<P>childhood would be a surer guide than the instructions of the most

<P>mature adviser.&nbsp; I had but to turn from my little pupils to myself

<P>at their age, and I should know, at once, how to win their

<P>confidence and affections:&nbsp; how to waken the contrition of the

<P>erring; how to embolden the timid and console the afflicted; how to

<P>make Virtue practicable, Instruction desirable, and Religion lovely

<P>and comprehensible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>- Delightful task!

<P>To teach the young idea how to shoot!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To train the tender plants, and watch their buds unfolding day by

<P>day!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Influenced by so many inducements, I determined still to persevere;

<P>though the fear of displeasing my mother, or distressing my

<P>father's feelings, prevented me from resuming the subject for

<P>several days.&nbsp; At length, again, I mentioned it to my mother in

<P>private; and, with some difficulty, got her to promise to assist me

<P>with her endeavours.&nbsp; My father's reluctant consent was next

<P>obtained, and then, though Mary still sighed her disapproval, my

<P>dear, kind mother began to look out for a situation for me.&nbsp; She

<P>wrote to my father's relations, and consulted the newspaper

<P>advertisements - her own relations she had long dropped all

<P>communication with:&nbsp; a formal interchange of occasional letters
was

<P>all she had ever had since her marriage, and she would not at any

<P>time have applied to them in a case of this nature.&nbsp; But so long

<P>and so entire had been my parents' seclusion from the world, that

<P>many weeks elapsed before a suitable situation could be procured.

<P>At last, to my great joy, it was decreed that I should take charge

<P>of the young family of a certain Mrs. Bloomfield; whom my kind,

<P>prim aunt Grey had known in her youth, and asserted to be a very

<P>nice woman.&nbsp; Her husband was a retired tradesman, who had realized

<P>a very comfortable fortune; but could not be prevailed upon to give

<P>a greater salary than twenty-five pounds to the instructress of his

<P>children.&nbsp; I, however, was glad to accept this, rather than refuse

<P>the situation - which my parents were inclined to think the better

<P>plan.

<P>But some weeks more were yet to be devoted to preparation.&nbsp; How

<P>long, how tedious those weeks appeared to me!&nbsp; Yet they were happy

<P>ones in the main - full of bright hopes and ardent expectations.

<P>With what peculiar pleasure I assisted at the making of my new

<P>clothes, and, subsequently, the packing of my trunks!&nbsp; But there

<P>was a feeling of bitterness mingling with the latter occupation

<P>too; and when it was done - when all was ready for my departure on

<P>the morrow, and the last night at home approached - a sudden

<P>anguish seemed to swell my heart.&nbsp; My dear friends looked so sad,

<P>and spoke so very kindly, that I could scarcely keep my eyes from

<P>overflowing:&nbsp; but I still affected to be gay.&nbsp; I had taken
my last

<P>ramble with Mary on the moors, my last walk in the garden, and

<P>round the house; I had fed, with her, our pet pigeons for the last

<P>time - the pretty creatures that we had tamed to peck their food

<P>from our hands:&nbsp; I had given a farewell stroke to all their silky

<P>backs as they crowded in my lap.&nbsp; I had tenderly kissed my own

<P>peculiar favourites, the pair of snow-white fantails; I had played

<P>my last tune on the old familiar piano, and sung my last song to

<P>papa:&nbsp; not the last, I hoped, but the last for what appeared to
me

<P>a very long time.&nbsp; And, perhaps, when I did these things again
it

<P>would be with different feelings:&nbsp; circumstances might be changed,

<P>and this house might never be my settled home again.&nbsp; My dear

<P>little friend, the kitten, would certainly be changed:&nbsp; she was

<P>already growing a fine cat; and when I returned, even for a hasty

<P>visit at Christmas, would, most likely, have forgotten both her

<P>playmate and her merry pranks.&nbsp; I had romped with her for the last

<P>time; and when I stroked her soft bright fur, while she lay purring

<P>herself to sleep in my lap, it was with a feeling of sadness I

<P>could not easily disguise.&nbsp; Then at bed-time, when I retired with

<P>Mary to our quiet little chamber, where already my drawers were

<P>cleared out and my share of the bookcase was empty - and where,

<P>hereafter, she would have to sleep alone, in dreary solitude, as

<P>she expressed it - my heart sank more than ever:&nbsp; I felt as if
I

<P>had been selfish and wrong to persist in leaving her; and when I

<P>knelt once more beside our little bed, I prayed for a blessing on

<P>her and on my parents more fervently than ever I had done before.

<P>To conceal my emotion, I buried my face in my hands, and they were

<P>presently bathed in tears.&nbsp; I perceived, on rising, that she had

<P>been crying too:&nbsp; but neither of us spoke; and in silence we betook

<P>ourselves to our repose, creeping more closely together from the

<P>consciousness that we were to part so soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the morning brought a renewal of hope and spirits.&nbsp; I was to

<P>depart early; that the conveyance which took me (a gig, hired from

<P>Mr. Smith, the draper, grocer, and tea-dealer of the village) might

<P>return the same day.&nbsp; I rose, washed, dressed, swallowed a hasty

<P>breakfast, received the fond embraces of my father, mother, and

<P>sister, kissed the cat - to the great scandal of Sally, the maid -

<P>shook hands with her, mounted the gig, drew my veil over my face,

<P>and then, but not till then, burst into a flood of tears.&nbsp; The
gig

<P>rolled on; I looked back; my dear mother and sister were still

<P>standing at the door, looking after me, and waving their adieux.&nbsp;
I

<P>returned their salute, and prayed God to bless them from my heart:

<P>we descended the hill, and I could see them no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It's a coldish mornin' for you, Miss Agnes,' observed Smith; 'and

<P>a darksome 'un too; but we's happen get to yon spot afore there

<P>come much rain to signify.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, I hope so,' replied I, as calmly as I could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It's comed a good sup last night too.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But this cold wind will happen keep it off.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Perhaps it will.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here ended our colloquy.&nbsp; We crossed the valley, and began to

<P>ascend the opposite hill.&nbsp; As we were toiling up, I looked back

<P>again; there was the village spire, and the old grey parsonage

<P>beyond it, basking in a slanting beam of sunshine - it was but a

<P>sickly ray, but the village and surrounding hills were all in

<P>sombre shade, and I hailed the wandering beam as a propitious omen

<P>to my home.&nbsp; With clasped hands I fervently implored a blessing
on

<P>its inhabitants, and hastily turned away; for I saw the sunshine

<P>was departing; and I carefully avoided another glance, lest I

<P>should see it in gloomy shadow, like the rest of the landscape.
