<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BESIDES the old lady, there was another relative of the family,

<P>whose visits were a great annoyance to me - this was 'Uncle

<P>Robson,' Mrs. Bloomfield's brother; a tall, self-sufficient fellow,

<P>with dark hair and sallow complexion like his sister, a nose that

<P>seemed to disdain the earth, and little grey eyes, frequently half-

<P>closed, with a mixture of real stupidity and affected contempt of

<P>all surrounding objects.&nbsp; He was a thick-set, strongly-built man,

<P>but he had found some means of compressing his waist into a

<P>remarkably small compass; and that, together with the unnatural

<P>stillness of his form, showed that the lofty-minded, manly Mr.

<P>Robson, the scorner of the female sex, was not above the foppery of

<P>stays.&nbsp; He seldom deigned to notice me; and, when he did, it was

<P>with a certain supercilious insolence of tone and manner that

<P>convinced me he was no gentleman:&nbsp; though it was intended to have
a

<P>contrary effect.&nbsp; But it was not for that I disliked his coming,
so

<P>much as for the harm he did the children - encouraging all their

<P>evil propensities, and undoing in a few minutes the little good it

<P>had taken me months of labour to achieve.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny and little Harriet he seldom condescended to notice; but Mary

<P>Ann was something of a favourite.&nbsp; He was continually encouraging

<P>her tendency to affectation (which I had done my utmost to crush),

<P>talking about her pretty face, and filling her head with all manner

<P>of conceited notions concerning her personal appearance (which I

<P>had instructed her to regard as dust in the balance compared with

<P>the cultivation of her mind and manners); and I never saw a child

<P>so susceptible of flattery as she was.&nbsp; Whatever was wrong, in

<P>either her or her brother, he would encourage by laughing at, if

<P>not by actually praising:&nbsp; people little know the injury they do
to

<P>children by laughing at their faults, and making a pleasant jest of

<P>what their true friends have endeavoured to teach them to hold in

<P>grave abhorrence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though not a positive drunkard, Mr. Robson habitually swallowed

<P>great quantities of wine, and took with relish an occasional glass

<P>of brandy and water.&nbsp; He taught his nephew to imitate him in this

<P>to the utmost of his ability, and to believe that the more wine and

<P>spirits he could take, and the better he liked them, the more he

<P>manifested his bold, and manly spirit, and rose superior to his

<P>sisters.&nbsp; Mr. Bloomfield had not much to say against it, for his

<P>favourite beverage was gin and water; of which he took a

<P>considerable portion every day, by dint of constant sipping - and

<P>to that I chiefly attributed his dingy complexion and waspish

<P>temper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Robson likewise encouraged Tom's propensity to persecute the

<P>lower creation, both by precept and example.&nbsp; As he frequently
came

<P>to course or shoot over his brother-in-law's grounds, he would

<P>bring his favourite dogs with him; and he treated them so brutally

<P>that, poor as I was, I would have given a sovereign any day to see

<P>one of them bite him, provided the animal could have done it with

<P>impunity.&nbsp; Sometimes, when in a very complacent mood, he would
go

<P>a-birds'-nesting with the children, a thing that irritated and

<P>annoyed me exceedingly; as, by frequent and persevering attempts, I

<P>flattered myself I had partly shown them the evil of this pastime,

<P>and hoped, in time, to bring them to some general sense of justice

<P>and humanity; but ten minutes' birds'-nesting with uncle Robson, or

<P>even a laugh from him at some relation of their former barbarities,

<P>was sufficient at once to destroy the effect of my whole elaborate

<P>course of reasoning and persuasion.&nbsp; Happily, however, during that

<P>spring, they never, but once, got anything but empty nests, or eggs

<P>- being too impatient to leave them till the birds were hatched;

<P>that once, Tom, who had been with his uncle into the neighbouring

<P>plantation, came running in high glee into the garden, with a brood

<P>of little callow nestlings in his hands.&nbsp; Mary Ann and Fanny, whom

<P>I was just bringing out, ran to admire his spoils, and to beg each

<P>a bird for themselves.&nbsp; 'No, not one!' cried Tom.&nbsp; 'They're
all

<P>mine; uncle Robson gave them to me - one, two, three, four, five -

<P>you shan't touch one of them! no, not one, for your lives!'

<P>continued he, exultingly; laying the nest on the ground, and

<P>standing over it with his legs wide apart, his hands thrust into

<P>his breeches-pockets, his body bent forward, and his face twisted

<P>into all manner of contortions in the ecstasy of his delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you shall see me fettle 'em off.&nbsp; My word, but I WILL wallop

<P>'em?&nbsp; See if I don't now.&nbsp; By gum! but there's rare sport
for me in

<P>that nest.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, Tom,' said I, 'I shall not allow you to torture those birds.

<P>They must either be killed at once or carried back to the place you

<P>took them from, that the old birds may continue to feed them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you don't know where that is, Madam:&nbsp; it's only me and uncle

<P>Robson that knows that.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But if you don't tell me, I shall kill them myself - much as I

<P>hate it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You daren't.&nbsp; You daren't touch them for your life! because you

<P>know papa and mamma, and uncle Robson, would be angry.&nbsp; Ha, ha!

<P>I've caught you there, Miss!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I shall do what I think right in a case of this sort without

<P>consulting any one.&nbsp; If your papa and mamma don't happen to approve

<P>of it, I shall be sorry to offend them; but your uncle Robson's

<P>opinions, of course, are nothing to me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So saying - urged by a sense of duty - at the risk of both making

<P>myself sick and incurring the wrath of my employers - I got a large

<P>flat stone, that had been reared up for a mouse-trap by the

<P>gardener; then, having once more vainly endeavoured to persuade the

<P>little tyrant to let the birds be carried back, I asked what he

<P>intended to do with them.&nbsp; With fiendish glee he commenced a list

<P>of torments; and while he was busied in the relation, I dropped the

<P>stone upon his intended victims and crushed them flat beneath it.

<P>Loud were the outcries, terrible the execrations, consequent upon

<P>this daring outrage; uncle Robson had been coming up the walk with

<P>his gun, and was just then pausing to kick his dog.&nbsp; Tom flew

<P>towards him, vowing he would make him kick me instead of Juno.&nbsp;
Mr.

<P>Robson leant upon his gun, and laughed excessively at the violence

<P>of his nephew's passion, and the bitter maledictions and

<P>opprobrious epithets he heaped upon me.&nbsp; 'Well, you ARE a good

<P>'un!' exclaimed he, at length, taking up his weapon and proceeding

<P>towards the house.&nbsp; 'Damme, but the lad has some spunk in him,
too.

<P>Curse me, if ever I saw a nobler little scoundrel than that.&nbsp; He's

<P>beyond petticoat government already:&nbsp; by God! he defies mother,

<P>granny, governess, and all!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Never mind, Tom,
I'll get

<P>you another brood to-morrow.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'If you do, Mr. Robson, I shall kill them too,' said I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Humph!' replied he, and having honoured me with a broad stare -

<P>which, contrary to his expectations, I sustained without flinching

<P>- he turned away with an air of supreme contempt, and stalked into

<P>the house.&nbsp; Tom next went to tell his mamma.&nbsp; It was not her
way to

<P>say much on any subject; but, when she next saw me, her aspect and

<P>demeanour were doubly dark and chilled.&nbsp; After some casual remark

<P>about the weather, she observed - 'I am sorry, Miss Grey, you

<P>should think it necessary to interfere with Master Bloomfield's

<P>amusements; he was very much distressed about your destroying the

<P>birds.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'When Master Bloomfield's amusements consist in injuring sentient

<P>creatures,' I answered, 'I think it my duty to interfere.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You seemed to have forgotten,' said she, calmly, 'that the

<P>creatures were all created for our convenience.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I thought that doctrine admitted some doubt, but merely replied -

<P>'If they were, we have no right to torment them for our amusement.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I think,' said she, 'a child's amusement is scarcely to be weighed

<P>against the welfare of a soulless brute.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, for the child's own sake, it ought not to be encouraged to

<P>have such amusements,' answered I, as meekly as I could, to make up

<P>for such unusual pertinacity.&nbsp; '"Blessed are the merciful, for
they

<P>shall obtain mercy."'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh! of course; but that refers to our conduct towards each other.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"The merciful man shows mercy to his beast,"' I ventured to add.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I think YOU have not shown much mercy,' replied she, with a short,

<P>bitter laugh; 'killing the poor birds by wholesale in that shocking

<P>manner, and putting the dear boy to such misery for a mere whim.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I judged it prudent to say no more.&nbsp; This was the nearest approach

<P>to a quarrel I ever had with Mrs. Bloomfield; as well as the

<P>greatest number of words I ever exchanged with her at one time,

<P>since the day of my first arrival.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mr. Robson and old Mrs. Bloomfield were not the only guests

<P>whose coming to Wellwood House annoyed me; every visitor disturbed

<P>me more or less; not so much because they neglected me (though I

<P>did feel their conduct strange and disagreeable in that respect),

<P>as because I found it impossible to keep my pupils away from them,

<P>as I was repeatedly desired to do:&nbsp; Tom must talk to them, and
Mary

<P>Ann must be noticed by them.&nbsp; Neither the one nor the other knew

<P>what it was to feel any degree of shamefacedness, or even common

<P>modesty.&nbsp; They would indecently and clamorously interrupt the

<P>conversation of their elders, tease them with the most impertinent

<P>questions, roughly collar the gentlemen, climb their knees

<P>uninvited, hang about their shoulders or rifle their pockets, pull

<P>the ladies' gowns, disorder their hair, tumble their collars, and

<P>importunately beg for their trinkets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Bloomfield had the sense to be shocked and annoyed at all

<P>this, but she had not sense to prevent it:&nbsp; she expected me to

<P>prevent it.&nbsp; But how could I - when the guests, with their fine

<P>clothes and new faces, continually flattered and indulged them, out

<P>of complaisance to their parents - how could I, with my homely

<P>garments, every-day face, and honest words, draw them away?&nbsp; I

<P>strained every nerve to do so:&nbsp; by striving to amuse them, I

<P>endeavoured to attract them to my side; by the exertion of such

<P>authority as I possessed, and by such severity as I dared to use, I

<P>tried to deter them from tormenting the guests; and by reproaching

<P>their unmannerly conduct, to make them ashamed to repeat it.&nbsp; But

<P>they knew no shame; they scorned authority which had no terrors to

<P>back it; and as for kindness and affection, either they had no

<P>hearts, or such as they had were so strongly guarded, and so well

<P>concealed, that I, with all my efforts, had not yet discovered how

<P>to reach them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But soon my trials in this quarter came to a close - sooner than I

<P>either expected or desired; for one sweet evening towards the close

<P>of May, as I was rejoicing in the near approach of the holidays,

<P>and congratulating myself upon having made some progress with my

<P>pupils (as far as their learning went, at least, for I HAD

<P>instilled SOMETHING into their heads, and I had, at length, brought

<P>them to be a little - a very little - more rational about getting

<P>their lessons done in time to leave some space for recreation,

<P>instead of tormenting themselves and me all day long to no

<P>purpose), Mrs. Bloomfield sent for me, and calmly told me that

<P>after Midsummer my services would be no longer required.&nbsp; She

<P>assured me that my character and general conduct were

<P>unexceptionable; but the children had made so little improvement

<P>since my arrival that Mr. Bloomfield and she felt it their duty to

<P>seek some other mode of instruction.&nbsp; Though superior to most

<P>children of their years in abilities, they were decidedly behind

<P>them in attainments; their manners were uncultivated, and their

<P>tempers unruly.&nbsp; And this she attributed to a want of sufficient

<P>firmness, and diligent, persevering care on my part.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Unshaken firmness, devoted diligence, unwearied perseverance,

<P>unceasing care, were the very qualifications on which I had

<P>secretly prided myself; and by which I had hoped in time to

<P>overcome all difficulties, and obtain success at last.&nbsp; I wished
to

<P>say something in my own justification; but in attempting to speak,

<P>I felt my voice falter; and rather than testify any emotion, or

<P>suffer the tears to overflow that were already gathering in my

<P>eyes, I chose to keep silence, and bear all like a self-convicted

<P>culprit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus was I dismissed, and thus I sought my home.&nbsp; Alas! what would

<P>they think of me? unable, after all my boasting, to keep my place,

<P>even for a single year, as governess to three small children, whose

<P>mother was asserted by my own aunt to be a 'very nice woman.'

<P>Having been thus weighed in the balance and found wanting, I need

<P>not hope they would be willing to try me again.&nbsp; And this was an

<P>unwelcome thought; for vexed, harassed, disappointed as I had been,

<P>and greatly as I had learned to love and value my home, I was not

<P>yet weary of adventure, nor willing to relax my efforts.&nbsp; I knew

<P>that all parents were not like Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield, and I was

<P>certain all children were not like theirs.&nbsp; The next family must
be

<P>different, and any change must be for the better.&nbsp; I had been

<P>seasoned by adversity, and tutored by experience, and I longed to

<P>redeem my lost honour in the eyes of those whose opinion was more

<P>than that of all the world to me.
