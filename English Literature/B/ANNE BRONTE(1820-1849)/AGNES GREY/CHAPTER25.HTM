<P>'WELL, Agnes, you must not take such long walks again before

<P>breakfast,' said my mother, observing that I drank an extra cup of

<P>coffee and ate nothing - pleading the heat of the weather, and the

<P>fatigue of my long walk as an excuse.&nbsp; I certainly did feel

<P>feverish and tired too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You always do things by extremes:&nbsp; now, if you had taken a SHORT

<P>walk every morning, and would continue to do so, it would do you

<P>good.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, mamma, I will.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But this is worse than lying in bed or bending over your books:

<P>you have quite put yourself into a fever.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I won't do it again,' said I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was racking my brains with thinking how to tell her about Mr.

<P>Weston, for she must know he was coming to-morrow.&nbsp; However, I

<P>waited till the breakfast things were removed, and I was more calm

<P>and cool; and then, having sat down to my drawing, I began - 'I met

<P>an old friend on the sands to-day, mamma.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'An old friend!&nbsp; Who could it be?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Two old friends, indeed.&nbsp; One was a dog;' and then I reminded
her

<P>of Snap, whose history I had recounted before, and related the

<P>incident of his sudden appearance and remarkable recognition; 'and

<P>the other,' continued I, 'was Mr. Weston, the curate of Horton.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mr. Weston!&nbsp; I never heard of him before.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, you have:&nbsp; I've mentioned him several times, I believe:&nbsp;
but

<P>you don't remember.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I've heard you speak of Mr. Hatfield.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mr. Hatfield was the rector, and Mr. Weston the curate:&nbsp; I used
to

<P>mention him sometimes in contradistinction to Mr. Hatfield, as

<P>being a more efficient clergyman.&nbsp; However, he was on the sands

<P>this morning with the dog - he had bought it, I suppose, from the

<P>rat-catcher; and he knew me as well as it did - probably through

<P>its means:&nbsp; and I had a little conversation with him, in the course

<P>of which, as he asked about our school, I was led to say something

<P>about you, and your good management; and he said he should like to

<P>know you, and asked if I would introduce him to you, if he should

<P>take the liberty of calling to-morrow; so I said I would.&nbsp; Was
I

<P>right?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Of course.&nbsp; What kind of a man is he?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'A very RESPECTABLE man, I think:&nbsp; but you will see him to-morrow.

<P>He is the new vicar of F-, and as he has only been there a few

<P>weeks, I suppose he has made no friends yet, and wants a little

<P>society.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The morrow came.&nbsp; What a fever of anxiety and expectation I was
in

<P>from breakfast till noon - at which time he made his appearance!

<P>Having introduced him to my mother, I took my work to the window,

<P>and sat down to await the result of the interview.&nbsp; They got on

<P>extremely well together - greatly to my satisfaction, for I had

<P>felt very anxious about what my mother would think of him.&nbsp; He
did

<P>not stay long that time:&nbsp; but when he rose to take leave, she said

<P>she should be happy to see him, whenever he might find it

<P>convenient to call again; and when he was gone, I was gratified by

<P>hearing her say, - 'Well!&nbsp; I think he's a very sensible man.&nbsp;
But

<P>why did you sit back there, Agnes,' she added, 'and talk so

<P>little?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Because you talked so well, mamma, I thought you required no

<P>assistance from me:&nbsp; and, besides, he was your visitor, not mine.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After that, he often called upon us - several times in the course

<P>of a week.&nbsp; He generally addressed most of his conversation to
my

<P>mother:&nbsp; and no wonder, for she could converse.&nbsp; I almost
envied

<P>the unfettered, vigorous fluency of her discourse, and the strong

<P>sense evinced by everything she said - and yet, I did not; for,

<P>though I occasionally regretted my own deficiencies for his sake,

<P>it gave me very great pleasure to sit and hear the two beings I

<P>loved and honoured above every one else in the world, discoursing

<P>together so amicably, so wisely, and so well.&nbsp; I was not always

<P>silent, however; nor was I at all neglected.&nbsp; I was quite as much

<P>noticed as I would wish to be:&nbsp; there was no lack of kind words
and

<P>kinder looks, no end of delicate attentions, too fine and subtle to

<P>be grasped by words, and therefore indescribable - but deeply felt

<P>at heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ceremony was quickly dropped between us:&nbsp; Mr. Weston came as an

<P>expected guest, welcome at all times, and never deranging the

<P>economy of our household affairs.&nbsp; He even called me 'Agnes:' the

<P>name had been timidly spoken at first, but, finding it gave no

<P>offence in any quarter, he seemed greatly to prefer that

<P>appellation to 'Miss Grey;' and so did I.&nbsp; How tedious and gloomy

<P>were those days in which he did not come!&nbsp; And yet not miserable;

<P>for I had still the remembrance of the last visit and the hope of

<P>the next to cheer me.&nbsp; But when two or three days passed without
my

<P>seeing him, I certainly felt very anxious - absurdly, unreasonably

<P>so; for, of course, he had his own business and the affairs of his

<P>parish to attend to.&nbsp; And I dreaded the close of the holidays,
when

<P>MY business also would begin, and I should be sometimes unable to

<P>see him, and sometimes - when my mother was in the schoolroom -

<P>obliged to be with him alone:&nbsp; a position I did not at all desire,

<P>in the house; though to meet him out of doors, and walk beside him,

<P>had proved by no means disagreeable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One evening, however, in the last week of the vacation, he arrived

<P>- unexpectedly:&nbsp; for a heavy and protracted thunder-shower during

<P>the afternoon had almost destroyed my hopes of seeing him that day;

<P>but now the storm was over, and the sun was shining brightly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'A beautiful evening, Mrs. Grey!' said he, as he entered.&nbsp; 'Agnes,

<P>I want you to take a walk with me to - ' (he named a certain part

<P>of the coast - a bold hill on the land side, and towards the sea a

<P>steep precipice, from the summit of which a glorious view is to be

<P>had).&nbsp; 'The rain has laid the dust, and cooled and cleared the
air,

<P>and the prospect will be magnificent.&nbsp; Will you come?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Can I go, mamma?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes; to be sure.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I went to get ready, and was down again in a few minutes; though,

<P>of course, I took a little more pains with my attire than if I had

<P>merely been going out on some shopping expedition alone.&nbsp; The

<P>thunder-shower had certainly had a most beneficial effect upon the

<P>weather, and the evening was most delightful.&nbsp; Mr. Weston would

<P>have me to take his arm; he said little during our passage through

<P>the crowded streets, but walked very fast, and appeared grave and

<P>abstracted.&nbsp; I wondered what was the matter, and felt an indefinite

<P>dread that something unpleasant was on his mind; and vague

<P>surmises, concerning what it might be, troubled me not a little,

<P>and made me grave and silent enough.&nbsp; But these fantasies vanished

<P>upon reaching the quiet outskirts of the town; for as soon as we

<P>came within sight of the venerable old church, and the - hill, with

<P>the deep blue beyond it, I found my companion was cheerful enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I'm afraid I've been walking too fast for you, Agnes,' said he:

<P>'in my impatience to be rid of the town, I forgot to consult your

<P>convenience; but now we'll walk as slowly as you please.&nbsp; I see,
by

<P>those light clouds in the west, there will be a brilliant sunset,

<P>and we shall be in time to witness its effect upon the sea, at the

<P>most moderate rate of progression.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When we had got about half-way up the hill, we fell into silence

<P>again; which, as usual, he was the first to break.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'My house is desolate yet, Miss Grey,' he smilingly observed, 'and

<P>I am acquainted now with all the ladies in my parish, and several

<P>in this town too; and many others I know by sight and by report;

<P>but not one of them will suit me for a companion; in fact, there is

<P>only one person in the world that will:&nbsp; and that is yourself;
and

<P>I want to know your decision?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Are you in earnest, Mr. Weston?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'In earnest!&nbsp; How could you think I should jest on such a subject?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He laid his hand on mine, that rested on his arm:&nbsp; he must have

<P>felt it tremble - but it was no great matter now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I hope I have not been too precipitate,' he said, in a serious

<P>tone.&nbsp; 'You must have known that it was not my way to flatter and

<P>talk soft nonsense, or even to speak the admiration that I felt;

<P>and that a single word or glance of mine meant more than the honied

<P>phrases and fervent protestations of most other men.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I said something about not liking to leave my mother, and doing

<P>nothing without her consent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I settled everything with Mrs. Grey, while you were putting on

<P>your bonnet,' replied he.&nbsp; 'She said I might have her consent,
if I

<P>could obtain yours; and I asked her, in case I should be so happy,

<P>to come and live with us - for I was sure you would like it better.

<P>But she refused, saying she could now afford to employ an

<P>assistant, and would continue the school till she could purchase an

<P>annuity sufficient to maintain her in comfortable lodgings; and,

<P>meantime, she would spend her vacations alternately with us and

<P>your sister, and should be quite contented if you were happy.&nbsp;
And

<P>so now I have overruled your objections on her account.&nbsp; Have you

<P>any other?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No - none.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You love me then?' said be, fervently pressing my hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here I pause.&nbsp; My Diary, from which I have compiled these pages,

<P>goes but little further.&nbsp; I could go on for years, but I will

<P>content myself with adding, that I shall never forget that glorious

<P>summer evening, and always remember with delight that steep hill,

<P>and the edge of the precipice where we stood together, watching the

<P>splendid sunset mirrored in the restless world of waters at our

<P>feet - with hearts filled with gratitude to heaven, and happiness,

<P>and love - almost too full for speech.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few weeks after that, when my mother had supplied herself with an

<P>assistant, I became the wife of Edward Weston; and never have found

<P>cause to repent it, and am certain that I never shall.&nbsp; We have
had

<P>trials, and we know that we must have them again; but we bear them

<P>well together, and endeavour to fortify ourselves and each other

<P>against the final separation - that greatest of all afflictions to

<P>the survivor.&nbsp; But, if we keep in mind the glorious heaven beyond,

<P>where both may meet again, and sin and sorrow are unknown, surely

<P>that too may be borne; and, meantime, we endeavour to live to the

<P>glory of Him who has scattered so many blessings in our path.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edward, by his strenuous exertions, has worked surprising reforms

<P>in his parish, and is esteemed and loved by its inhabitants - as he

<P>deserves; for whatever his faults may be as a man (and no one is

<P>entirely without), I defy anybody to blame him as a pastor, a

<P>husband, or a father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Our children, Edward, Agnes, and little Mary, promise well; their

<P>education, for the time being, is chiefly committed to me; and they

<P>shall want no good thing that a mother's care can give.&nbsp; Our modest

<P>income is amply sufficient for our requirements:&nbsp; and by practising

<P>the economy we learnt in harder times, and never attempting to

<P>imitate our richer neighbours, we manage not only to enjoy comfort

<P>and contentment ourselves, but to have every year something to lay

<P>by for our children, and something to give to those who need it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now I think I have said sufficient.
