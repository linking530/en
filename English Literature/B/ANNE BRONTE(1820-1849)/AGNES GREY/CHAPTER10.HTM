<P>'WELL, Miss Grey, what do you think of the new curate?' asked Miss

<P>Murray, on our return from church the Sunday after the

<P>recommencement of our duties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I can scarcely tell,' was my reply:&nbsp; 'I have not even heard him

<P>preach.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, but you saw him, didn't you?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, but I cannot pretend to judge of a man's character by a

<P>single cursory glance at his face.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But isn't he ugly?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He did not strike me as being particularly so; I don't dislike

<P>that cast of countenance:&nbsp; but the only thing I particularly

<P>noticed about him was his style of reading; which appeared to me

<P>good - infinitely better, at least, than Mr. Hatfield's.&nbsp; He read

<P>the Lessons as if he were bent on giving full effect to every

<P>passage; it seemed as if the most careless person could not have

<P>helped attending, nor the most ignorant have failed to understand;

<P>and the prayers he read as if he were not reading at all, but

<P>praying earnestly and sincerely from his own heart.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, yes, that's all he is good for:&nbsp; he can plod through the

<P>service well enough; but he has not a single idea beyond it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How do you know?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh! I know perfectly well; I am an excellent judge in such

<P>matters.&nbsp; Did you see how he went out of church? stumping along
-

<P>as if there were nobody there but himself - never looking to the

<P>right hand or the left, and evidently thinking of nothing but just

<P>getting out of the church, and, perhaps, home to his dinner:&nbsp; his

<P>great stupid head could contain no other idea.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I suppose you would have had him cast a glance into the squire's

<P>pew,' said I, laughing at the vehemence of her hostility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Indeed! I should have been highly indignant if he had dared to do

<P>such a thing!' replied she, haughtily tossing her head; then, after

<P>a moment's reflection, she added - 'Well, well!&nbsp; I suppose he's

<P>good enough for his place:&nbsp; but I'm glad I'm not dependent on HIM

<P>for amusement - that's all.&nbsp; Did you see how Mr. Hatfield hurried

<P>out to get a bow from me, and be in time to put us into the

<P>carriage?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes,' answered I; internally adding, 'and I thought it somewhat

<P>derogatory to his dignity as a clergyman to come flying from the

<P>pulpit in such eager haste to shake hands with the squire, and hand

<P>his wife and daughters into their carriage:&nbsp; and, moreover, I owe

<P>him a grudge for nearly shutting me out of it'; for, in fact,

<P>though I was standing before his face, close beside the carriage

<P>steps, waiting to get in, he would persist in putting them up and

<P>closing the door, till one of the family stopped him by calling out

<P>that the governess was not in yet; then, without a word of apology,

<P>he departed, wishing them good-morning, and leaving the footman to

<P>finish the business.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>NOTA BENE. - Mr. Hatfield never spoke to me, neither did Sir Hugh

<P>or Lady Meltham, nor Mr. Harry or Miss Meltham, nor Mr. Green or

<P>his sisters, nor any other lady or gentleman who frequented that

<P>church:&nbsp; nor, in fact, any one that visited at Horton Lodge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Murray ordered the carriage again, in the afternoon, for

<P>herself and her sister:&nbsp; she said it was too cold for them to enjoy

<P>themselves in the garden; and besides, she believed Harry Meltham

<P>would be at church.&nbsp; 'For,' said she, smiling slyly at her own
fair

<P>image in the glass, 'he has been a most exemplary attendant at

<P>church these last few Sundays:&nbsp; you would think he was quite a
good

<P>Christian.&nbsp; And you may go with us, Miss Grey:&nbsp; I want you
to see

<P>him; he is so greatly improved since he returned from abroad - you

<P>can't think!&nbsp; And besides, then you will have an opportunity of

<P>seeing the beautiful Mr. Weston again, and of hearing him preach.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I did hear him preach, and was decidedly pleased with the

<P>evangelical truth of his doctrine, as well as the earnest

<P>simplicity of his manner, and the clearness and force of his style.

<P>It was truly refreshing to hear such a sermon, after being so long

<P>accustomed to the dry, prosy discourses of the former curate, and

<P>the still less edifying harangues of the rector.&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield

<P>would come sailing up the aisle, or rather sweeping along like a

<P>whirlwind, with his rich silk gown flying behind him and rustling

<P>against the pew doors, mount the pulpit like a conqueror ascending

<P>his triumphal car; then, sinking on the velvet cushion in an

<P>attitude of studied grace, remain in silent prostration for a

<P>certain time; then mutter over a Collect, and gabble through the

<P>Lord's Prayer, rise, draw off one bright lavender glove, to give

<P>the congregation the benefit of his sparkling rings, lightly pass

<P>his fingers through his well-curled hair, flourish a cambric

<P>handkerchief, recite a very short passage, or, perhaps, a mere

<P>phrase of Scripture, as a head-piece to his discourse, and,

<P>finally, deliver a composition which, as a composition, might be

<P>considered good, though far too studied and too artificial to be

<P>pleasing to me:&nbsp; the propositions were well laid down, the

<P>arguments logically conducted; and yet, it was sometimes hard to

<P>listen quietly throughout, without some slight demonstrations of

<P>disapproval or impatience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and

<P>ceremonies, apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and

<P>obedience to the clergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent, the

<P>absolute necessity of observing all the forms of godliness, the

<P>reprehensible presumption of individuals who attempted to think for

<P>themselves in matters connected with religion, or to be guided by

<P>their own interpretations of Scripture, and, occasionally (to

<P>please his wealthy parishioners) the necessity of deferential

<P>obedience from the poor to the rich - supporting his maxims and

<P>exhortations throughout with quotations from the Fathers:&nbsp; with

<P>whom he appeared to be far better acquainted than with the Apostles

<P>and Evangelists, and whose importance he seemed to consider at

<P>least equal to theirs.&nbsp; But now and then he gave us a sermon of
a

<P>different order - what some would call a very good one; but sunless

<P>and severe:&nbsp; representing the Deity as a terrible taskmaster rather

<P>than a benevolent father.&nbsp; Yet, as I listened, I felt inclined
to

<P>think the man was sincere in all he said:&nbsp; he must have changed
his

<P>views, and become decidedly religious, gloomy and austere, yet

<P>still devout.&nbsp; But such illusions were usually dissipated, on

<P>coming out of church, by hearing his voice in jocund colloquy with

<P>some of the Melthams or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrays

<P>themselves; probably laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he

<P>had given the rascally people something to think about; perchance,

<P>exulting in the thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay aside

<P>the sinful indulgence of her pipe, which had been her daily solace

<P>for upwards of thirty years:&nbsp; that George Higgins would be

<P>frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks, and Thomas Jackson

<P>would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken in his sure

<P>and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus, I could not but conclude that Mr. Hatfield was one of those

<P>who 'bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them

<P>upon men's shoulders, while they themselves will not move them with

<P>one of their fingers'; and who 'make the word of God of none effect

<P>by their traditions, teaching for doctrines the commandments of

<P>men.'&nbsp; I was well pleased to observe that the new curate resembled

<P>him, as far as I could see, in none of these particulars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, Miss Grey, what do you think of him now?' said Miss Murray,

<P>as we took our places in the carriage after service.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No harm still,' replied I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No harm!' repeated she in amazement.&nbsp; 'What do you mean?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I mean, I think no worse of him than I did before.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No worse!&nbsp; I should think not indeed - quite the contrary!&nbsp;
Is he

<P>not greatly improved?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, yes; very much indeed,' replied I; for I had now discovered

<P>that it was Harry Meltham she meant, not Mr. Weston.&nbsp; That

<P>gentleman had eagerly come forward to speak to the young ladies:&nbsp;
a

<P>thing he would hardly have ventured to do had their mother been

<P>present; he had likewise politely handed them into the carriage.

<P>He had not attempted to shut me out, like Mr. Hatfield; neither, of

<P>course, had he offered me his assistance (I should not have

<P>accepted it, if he had), but as long as the door remained open he

<P>had stood smirking and chatting with them, and then lifted his hat

<P>and departed to his own abode:&nbsp; but I had scarcely noticed him
all

<P>the time.&nbsp; My companions, however, had been more observant; and,
as

<P>we rolled along, they discussed between them not only his looks,

<P>words, and actions, but every feature of his face, and every

<P>article of his apparel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You shan't have him all to yourself, Rosalie,' said Miss Matilda

<P>at the close of this discussion; 'I like him:&nbsp; I know he'd make
a

<P>nice, jolly companion for me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, you're quite welcome to him, Matilda,' replied her sister,

<P>in a tone of affected indifference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And I'm sure,' continued the other, 'he admires me quite as much

<P>as he does you; doesn't he, Miss Grey?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know; I'm not acquainted with his sentiments.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, but he DOES though.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'My DEAR Matilda! nobody will ever admire you till you get rid of

<P>your rough, awkward manners.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, stuff!&nbsp; Harry Meltham likes such manners; and so do papa's

<P>friends.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, you MAY captivate old men, and younger sons; but nobody

<P>else, I am sure, will ever take a fancy to you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't care:&nbsp; I'm not always grabbing after money, like you and

<P>mamma.&nbsp; If my husband is able to keep a few good horses and dogs,
I

<P>shall be quite satisfied; and all the rest may go to the devil!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, if you use such shocking expressions, I'm sure no real

<P>gentleman will ever venture to come near you.&nbsp; Really, Miss Grey,

<P>you should not let her do so.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I can't possibly prevent it, Miss Murray.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And you're quite mistaken, Matilda, in supposing that Harry

<P>Meltham admires you:&nbsp; I assure you he does nothing of the kind.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Matilda was beginning an angry reply; but, happily, our journey was

<P>now at an end; and the contention was cut short by the footman

<P>opening the carriage-door, and letting down the steps for our

<P>descent.
