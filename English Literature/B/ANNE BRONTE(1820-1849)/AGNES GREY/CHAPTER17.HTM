<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>AS I am in the way of confessions I may as well acknowledge that,

<P>about this time, I paid more attention to dress than ever I had

<P>done before.&nbsp; This is not saying much - for hitherto I had been
a

<P>little neglectful in that particular; but now, also, it was no

<P>uncommon thing to spend as much as two minutes in the contemplation

<P>of my own image in the glass; though I never could derive any

<P>consolation from such a study.&nbsp; I could discover no beauty in those

<P>marked features, that pale hollow cheek, and ordinary dark brown

<P>hair; there might be intellect in the forehead, there might be

<P>expression in the dark grey eyes, but what of that? - a low Grecian

<P>brow, and large black eyes devoid of sentiment would be esteemed

<P>far preferable.&nbsp; It is foolish to wish for beauty.&nbsp; Sensible
people

<P>never either desire it for themselves or care about it in others.

<P>If the mind be but well cultivated, and the heart well disposed, no

<P>one ever cares for the exterior.&nbsp; So said the teachers of our

<P>childhood; and so say we to the children of the present day.&nbsp; All

<P>very judicious and proper, no doubt; but are such assertions

<P>supported by actual experience?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We are naturally disposed to love what gives us pleasure, and what

<P>more pleasing than a beautiful face - when we know no harm of the

<P>possessor at least?&nbsp; A little girl loves her bird - Why?&nbsp;
Because

<P>it lives and feels; because it is helpless and harmless?&nbsp; A toad,

<P>likewise, lives and feels, and is equally helpless and harmless;

<P>but though she would not hurt a toad, she cannot love it like the

<P>bird, with its graceful form, soft feathers, and bright, speaking

<P>eyes.&nbsp; If a woman is fair and amiable, she is praised for both

<P>qualities, but especially the former, by the bulk of mankind:&nbsp;
if,

<P>on the other hand, she is disagreeable in person and character, her

<P>plainness is commonly inveighed against as her greatest crime,

<P>because, to common observers, it gives the greatest offence; while,

<P>if she is plain and good, provided she is a person of retired

<P>manners and secluded life, no one ever knows of her goodness,

<P>except her immediate connections.&nbsp; Others, on the contrary, are

<P>disposed to form unfavourable opinions of her mind, and

<P>disposition, if it be but to excuse themselves for their

<P>instinctive dislike of one so unfavoured by nature; and VISA VERSA

<P>with her whose angel form conceals a vicious heart, or sheds a

<P>false, deceitful charm over defects and foibles that would not be

<P>tolerated in another.&nbsp; They that have beauty, let them be thankful

<P>for it, and make a good use of it, like any other talent; they that

<P>have it not, let them console themselves, and do the best they can

<P>without it:&nbsp; certainly, though liable to be over-estimated, it
is a

<P>gift of God, and not to be despised.&nbsp; Many will feel this who have

<P>felt that they could love, and whose hearts tell them that they are

<P>worthy to be loved again; while yet they are debarred, by the lack

<P>of this or some such seeming trifle, from giving and receiving that

<P>happiness they seem almost made to feel and to impart.&nbsp; As well

<P>might the humble glowworm despise that power of giving light

<P>without which the roving fly might pass her and repass her a

<P>thousand times, and never rest beside her:&nbsp; she might hear her

<P>winged darling buzzing over and around her; he vainly seeking her,

<P>she longing to be found, but with no power to make her presence

<P>known, no voice to call him, no wings to follow his flight; - the

<P>fly must seek another mate, the worm must live and die alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such were some of my reflections about this period.&nbsp; I might go
on

<P>prosing more and more, I might dive much deeper, and disclose other

<P>thoughts, propose questions the reader might be puzzled to answer,

<P>and deduce arguments that might startle his prejudices, or,

<P>perhaps, provoke his ridicule, because he could not comprehend

<P>them; but I forbear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, therefore, let us return to Miss Murray.&nbsp; She accompanied
her

<P>mamma to the ball on Tuesday; of course splendidly attired, and

<P>delighted with her prospects and her charms.&nbsp; As Ashby Park was

<P>nearly ten miles distant from Horton Lodge, they had to set out

<P>pretty early, and I intended to have spent the evening with Nancy

<P>Brown, whom I had not seen for a long time; but my kind pupil took

<P>care I should spend it neither there nor anywhere else beyond the

<P>limits of the schoolroom, by giving me a piece of music to copy,

<P>which kept me closely occupied till bed-time.&nbsp; About eleven next

<P>morning, as soon as she had left her room, she came to tell me her

<P>news.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had indeed proposed to her at the ball; an event

<P>which reflected great credit on her mamma's sagacity, if not upon

<P>her skill in contrivance.&nbsp; I rather incline to the belief that
she

<P>had first laid her plans, and then predicted their success.&nbsp; The

<P>offer had been accepted, of course, and the bridegroom elect was

<P>coming that day to settle matters with Mr. Murray.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Rosalie was pleased with the thoughts of becoming mistress of Ashby

<P>Park; she was elated with the prospect of the bridal ceremony and

<P>its attendant splendour and eclat, the honeymoon spent abroad, and

<P>the subsequent gaieties she expected to enjoy in London and

<P>elsewhere; she appeared pretty well pleased too, for the time

<P>being, with Sir Thomas himself, because she had so lately seen him,

<P>danced with him, and been flattered by him; but, after all, she

<P>seemed to shrink from the idea of being so soon united:&nbsp; she wished

<P>the ceremony to be delayed some months, at least; and I wished it

<P>too.&nbsp; It seemed a horrible thing to hurry on the inauspicious

<P>match, and not to give the poor creature time to think and reason

<P>on the irrevocable step she was about to take.&nbsp; I made no

<P>pretension to 'a mother's watchful, anxious care,' but I was amazed

<P>and horrified at Mrs. Murray's heartlessness, or want of thought

<P>for the real good of her child; and by my unheeded warnings and

<P>exhortations, I vainly strove to remedy the evil.&nbsp; Miss Murray
only

<P>laughed at what I said; and I soon found that her reluctance to an

<P>immediate union arose chiefly from a desire to do what execution

<P>she could among the young gentlemen of her acquaintance, before she

<P>was incapacitated from further mischief of the kind.&nbsp; It was for

<P>this cause that, before confiding to me the secret of her

<P>engagement, she had extracted a promise that I would not mention a

<P>word on the subject to any one.&nbsp; And when I saw this, and when
I

<P>beheld her plunge more recklessly than ever into the depths of

<P>heartless coquetry, I had no more pity for her.&nbsp; 'Come what will,'

<P>I thought, 'she deserves it.&nbsp; Sir Thomas cannot be too bad for
her;

<P>and the sooner she is incapacitated from deceiving and injuring

<P>others the better.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wedding was fixed for the first of June.&nbsp; Between that and
the

<P>critical ball was little more than six weeks; but, with Rosalie's

<P>accomplished skill and resolute exertion, much might be done, even

<P>within that period; especially as Sir Thomas spent most of the

<P>interim in London; whither he went up, it was said, to settle

<P>affairs with his lawyer, and make other preparations for the

<P>approaching nuptials.&nbsp; He endeavoured to supply the want of his

<P>presence by a pretty constant fire of billets-doux; but these did

<P>not attract the neighbours' attention, and open their eyes, as

<P>personal visits would have done; and old Lady Ashby's haughty, sour

<P>spirit of reserve withheld her from spreading the news, while her

<P>indifferent health prevented her coming to visit her future

<P>daughter-in-law; so that, altogether, this affair was kept far

<P>closer than such things usually are.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Rosalie would sometimes show her lover's epistles to me, to

<P>convince me what a kind, devoted husband he would make.&nbsp; She showed

<P>me the letters of another individual, too, the unfortunate Mr.

<P>Green, who had not the courage, or, as she expressed it, the

<P>'spunk,' to plead his cause in person, but whom one denial would

<P>not satisfy:&nbsp; he must write again and again.&nbsp; He would not
have

<P>done so if he could have seen the grimaces his fair idol made over

<P>his moving appeals to her feelings, and heard her scornful

<P>laughter, and the opprobrious epithets she heaped upon him for his

<P>perseverance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why don't you tell him, at once, that you are engaged?' I asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, I don't want him to know that,' replied she.&nbsp; 'If he knew
it,

<P>his sisters and everybody would know it, and then there would be an

<P>end of my - ahem!&nbsp; And, besides, if I told him that, he would think

<P>my engagement was the only obstacle, and that I would have him if I

<P>were free; which I could not bear that any man should think, and

<P>he, of all others, at least.&nbsp; Besides, I don't care for his

<P>letters,' she added, contemptuously; 'he may write as often as he

<P>pleases, and look as great a calf as he likes when I meet him; it

<P>only amuses me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meantime, young Meltham was pretty frequent in his visits to the

<P>house or transits past it; and, judging by Matilda's execrations

<P>and reproaches, her sister paid more attention to him than civility

<P>required; in other words, she carried on as animated a flirtation

<P>as the presence of her parents would admit.&nbsp; She made some attempts

<P>to bring Mr. Hatfield once more to her feet; but finding them

<P>unsuccessful, she repaid his haughty indifference with still

<P>loftier scorn, and spoke of him with as much disdain and

<P>detestation as she had formerly done of his curate.&nbsp; But, amid
all

<P>this, she never for a moment lost sight of Mr. Weston.&nbsp; She

<P>embraced every opportunity of meeting him, tried every art to

<P>fascinate him, and pursued him with as much perseverance as if she

<P>really loved him and no other, and the happiness of her life

<P>depended upon eliciting a return of affection.&nbsp; Such conduct was

<P>completely beyond my comprehension.&nbsp; Had I seen it depicted in
a

<P>novel, I should have thought it unnatural; had I heard it described

<P>by others, I should have deemed it a mistake or an exaggeration;

<P>but when I saw it with my own eyes, and suffered from it too, I

<P>could only conclude that excessive vanity, like drunkenness,

<P>hardens the heart, enslaves the faculties, and perverts the

<P>feelings; and that dogs are not the only creatures which, when

<P>gorged to the throat, will yet gloat over what they cannot devour,

<P>and grudge the smallest morsel to a starving brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She now became extremely beneficent to the poor cottagers.&nbsp; Her

<P>acquaintance among them was more widely extended, her visits to

<P>their humble dwellings were more frequent and excursive than they

<P>had ever been before.&nbsp; Hereby, she earned among them the reputation

<P>of a condescending and very charitable young lady; and their

<P>encomiums were sure to be repeated to Mr. Weston:&nbsp; whom also she

<P>had thus a daily chance of meeting in one or other of their abodes,

<P>or in her transits to and fro; and often, likewise, she could

<P>gather, through their gossip, to what places he was likely to go at

<P>such and such a time, whether to baptize a child, or to visit the

<P>aged, the sick, the sad, or the dying; and most skilfully she laid

<P>her plans accordingly.&nbsp; In these excursions she would sometimes
go

<P>with her sister - whom, by some means, she had persuaded or bribed

<P>to enter into her schemes - sometimes alone, never, now, with me;

<P>so that I was debarred the pleasure of seeing Mr. Weston, or

<P>hearing his voice even in conversation with another:&nbsp; which would

<P>certainly have been a very great pleasure, however hurtful or

<P>however fraught with pain.&nbsp; I could not even see him at church:

<P>for Miss Murray, under some trivial pretext, chose to take

<P>possession of that corner in the family pew which had been mine

<P>ever since I came; and, unless I had the presumption to station

<P>myself between Mr. and Mrs. Murray, I must sit with my back to the

<P>pulpit, which I accordingly did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, also, I never walked home with my pupils:&nbsp; they said their

<P>mamma thought it did not look well to see three people out of the

<P>family walking, and only two going in the carriage; and, as they

<P>greatly preferred walking in fine weather, I should be honoured by

<P>going with the seniors.&nbsp; 'And besides,' said they, 'you can't walk

<P>as fast as we do; you know you're always lagging behind.'&nbsp; I knew

<P>these were false excuses, but I made no objections, and never

<P>contradicted such assertions, well knowing the motives which

<P>dictated them.&nbsp; And in the afternoons, during those six memorable

<P>weeks, I never went to church at all.&nbsp; If I had a cold, or any

<P>slight indisposition, they took advantage of that to make me stay

<P>at home; and often they would tell me they were not going again

<P>that day, themselves, and then pretend to change their minds, and

<P>set off without telling me:&nbsp; so managing their departure that I

<P>never discovered the change of purpose till too late.&nbsp; Upon their

<P>return home, on one of these occasions, they entertained me with an

<P>animated account of a conversation they had had with Mr. Weston as

<P>they came along.&nbsp; 'And he asked if you were ill, Miss Grey,' said

<P>Matilda; 'but we told him you were quite well, only you didn't want

<P>to come to church - so he'll think you're turned wicked.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All chance meetings on week-days were likewise carefully prevented;

<P>for, lest I should go to see poor Nancy Brown or any other person,

<P>Miss Murray took good care to provide sufficient employment for all

<P>my leisure hours.&nbsp; There was always some drawing to finish, some

<P>music to copy, or some work to do, sufficient to incapacitate me

<P>from indulging in anything beyond a short walk about the grounds,

<P>however she or her sister might be occupied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One morning, having sought and waylaid Mr. Weston, they returned in

<P>high glee to give me an account of their interview.&nbsp; 'And he asked

<P>after you again,' said Matilda, in spite of her sister's silent but

<P>imperative intimation that she should hold her tongue.&nbsp; 'He

<P>wondered why you were never with us, and thought you must have

<P>delicate health, as you came out so seldom.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He didn't Matilda - what nonsense you're talking!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Rosalie, what a lie!&nbsp; He did, you know; and you said - Don't,

<P>Rosalie - hang it! - I won't be pinched so!&nbsp; And, Miss Grey,

<P>Rosalie told him you were quite well, but you were always so buried

<P>in your books that you had no pleasure in anything else.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What an idea he must have of me!' I thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And,' I asked, 'does old Nancy ever inquire about me?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes; and we tell her you are so fond of reading and drawing that

<P>you can do nothing else.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'That is not the case though; if you had told her I was so busy I

<P>could not come to see her, it would have been nearer the truth.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't think it would,' replied Miss Murray, suddenly kindling

<P>up; 'I'm sure you have plenty of time to yourself now, when you

<P>have so little teaching to do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was no use beginning to dispute with such indulged, unreasoning

<P>creatures:&nbsp; so I held my peace.&nbsp; I was accustomed, now, to
keeping

<P>silence when things distasteful to my ear were uttered; and now,

<P>too, I was used to wearing a placid smiling countenance when my

<P>heart was bitter within me.&nbsp; Only those who have felt the like
can

<P>imagine my feelings, as I sat with an assumption of smiling

<P>indifference, listening to the accounts of those meetings and

<P>interviews with Mr. Weston, which they seemed to find such pleasure

<P>in describing to me; and hearing things asserted of him which, from

<P>the character of the man, I knew to be exaggerations and

<P>perversions of the truth, if not entirely false - things derogatory

<P>to him, and flattering to them - especially to Miss Murray - which

<P>I burned to contradict, or, at least, to show my doubts about, but

<P>dared not; lest, in expressing my disbelief, I should display my

<P>interest too.&nbsp; Other things I heard, which I felt or feared were

<P>indeed too true:&nbsp; but I must still conceal my anxiety respecting

<P>him, my indignation against them, beneath a careless aspect;

<P>others, again, mere hints of something said or done, which I longed

<P>to hear more of, but could not venture to inquire.&nbsp; So passed the

<P>weary time.&nbsp; I could not even comfort myself with saying, 'She
will

<P>soon be married; and then there may be hope.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon after her marriage the holidays would come; and when I

<P>returned from home, most likely, Mr. Weston would be gone, for I

<P>was told that he and the Rector could not agree (the Rector's

<P>fault, of course), and he was about to remove to another place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No - besides my hope in God, my only consolation was in thinking

<P>that, though he know it not, I was more worthy of his love than

<P>Rosalie Murray, charming and engaging as she was; for I could

<P>appreciate his excellence, which she could not:&nbsp; I would devote
my

<P>life to the promotion of his happiness; she would destroy his

<P>happiness for the momentary gratification of her own vanity.&nbsp; 'Oh,

<P>if he could but know the difference!'&nbsp; I would earnestly exclaim.

<P>'But no!&nbsp; I would not have him see my heart:&nbsp; yet, if he could
but

<P>know her hollowness, her worthless, heartless frivolity, he would

<P>then be safe, and I should be - ALMOST happy, though I might never

<P>see him more!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I fear, by this time, the reader is well nigh disgusted with the

<P>folly and weakness I have so freely laid before him.&nbsp; I never

<P>disclosed it then, and would not have done so had my own sister or

<P>my mother been with me in the house.&nbsp; I was a close and resolute

<P>dissembler - in this one case at least.&nbsp; My prayers, my tears,
my

<P>wishes, fears, and lamentations, were witnessed by myself and

<P>heaven alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When we are harassed by sorrows or anxieties, or long oppressed by

<P>any powerful feelings which we must keep to ourselves, for which we

<P>can obtain and seek no sympathy from any living creature, and which

<P>yet we cannot, or will not wholly crush, we often naturally seek

<P>relief in poetry - and often find it, too - whether in the

<P>effusions of others, which seem to harmonize with our existing

<P>case, or in our own attempts to give utterance to those thoughts

<P>and feelings in strains less musical, perchance, but more

<P>appropriate, and therefore more penetrating and sympathetic, and,

<P>for the time, more soothing, or more powerful to rouse and to

<P>unburden the oppressed and swollen heart.&nbsp; Before this time, at

<P>Wellwood House and here, when suffering from home-sick melancholy,

<P>I had sought relief twice or thrice at this secret source of

<P>consolation; and now I flew to it again, with greater avidity than

<P>ever, because I seemed to need it more.&nbsp; I still preserve those

<P>relics of past sufferings and experience, like pillars of witness

<P>set up in travelling through the vale of life, to mark particular

<P>occurrences.&nbsp; The footsteps are obliterated now; the face of the

<P>country may be changed; but the pillar is still there, to remind me

<P>how all things were when it was reared.&nbsp; Lest the reader should
be

<P>curious to see any of these effusions, I will favour him with one

<P>short specimen:&nbsp; cold and languid as the lines may seem, it was

<P>almost a passion of grief to which they owed their being:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Oh, they have robbed me of the hope

<P>My spirit held so dear;

<P>They will not let me hear that voice

<P>My soul delights to hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They will not let me see that face

<P>I so delight to see;

<P>And they have taken all thy smiles,

<P>And all thy love from me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, let them seize on all they can; -

<P>One treasure still is mine, -

<P>A heart that loves to think on thee,

<P>And feels the worth of thine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yes, at least, they could not deprive me of that:&nbsp; I could think
of

<P>him day and night; and I could feel that he was worthy to be

<P>thought of.&nbsp; Nobody knew him as I did; nobody could appreciate
him

<P>as I did; nobody could love him as I - could, if I might:&nbsp; but

<P>there was the evil.&nbsp; What business had I to think so much of one

<P>that never thought of me?&nbsp; Was it not foolish? was it not wrong?

<P>Yet, if I found such deep delight in thinking of him, and if I kept

<P>those thoughts to myself, and troubled no one else with them, where

<P>was the harm of it? I would ask myself.&nbsp; And such reasoning

<P>prevented me from making any sufficient effort to shake off my

<P>fetters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, if those thoughts brought delight, it was a painful, troubled

<P>pleasure, too near akin to anguish; and one that did me more injury

<P>than I was aware of.&nbsp; It was an indulgence that a person of more

<P>wisdom or more experience would doubtless have denied herself.&nbsp;
And

<P>yet, how dreary to turn my eyes from the contemplation of that

<P>bright object and force them to dwell on the dull, grey, desolate

<P>prospect around:&nbsp; the joyless, hopeless, solitary path that lay

<P>before me.&nbsp; It was wrong to be so joyless, so desponding; I should

<P>have made God my friend, and to do His will the pleasure and the

<P>business of my life; but faith was weak, and passion was too

<P>strong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this time of trouble I had two other causes of affliction.&nbsp;
The

<P>first may seem a trifle, but it cost me many a tear:&nbsp; Snap, my

<P>little dumb, rough-visaged, but bright-eyed, warm-hearted

<P>companion, the only thing I had to love me, was taken away, and

<P>delivered over to the tender mercies of the village rat-catcher, a

<P>man notorious for his brutal treatment of his canine slaves.&nbsp; The

<P>other was serious enough; my letters from home gave intimation that

<P>my father's health was worse.&nbsp; No boding fears were expressed,
but
