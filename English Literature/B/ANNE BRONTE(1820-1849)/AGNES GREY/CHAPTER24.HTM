<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>OUR school was not situated in the heart of the town:&nbsp; on entering

<P>A- from the north-west there is a row of respectable-looking

<P>houses, on each side of the broad, white road, with narrow slips of

<P>garden-ground before them, Venetian blinds to the windows, and a

<P>flight of steps leading to each trim, brass-handled door.&nbsp; In one

<P>of the largest of these habitations dwelt my mother and I, with

<P>such young ladies as our friends and the public chose to commit to

<P>our charge.&nbsp; Consequently, we were a considerable distance from
the

<P>sea, and divided from it by a labyrinth of streets and houses.&nbsp;
But

<P>the sea was my delight; and I would often gladly pierce the town to

<P>obtain the pleasure of a walk beside it, whether with the pupils,

<P>or alone with my mother during the vacations.&nbsp; It was delightful
to

<P>me at all times and seasons, but especially in the wild commotion

<P>of a rough sea-breeze, and in the brilliant freshness of a summer

<P>morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I awoke early on the third morning after my return from Ashby Park

<P>- the sun was shining through the blind, and I thought how pleasant

<P>it would be to pass through the quiet town and take a solitary

<P>ramble on the sands while half the world was in bed.&nbsp; I was not

<P>long in forming the resolution, nor slow to act upon it.&nbsp; Of course

<P>I would not disturb my mother, so I stole noiselessly downstairs,

<P>and quietly unfastened the door.&nbsp; I was dressed and out, when the

<P>church clock struck a quarter to six.&nbsp; There was a feeling of

<P>freshness and vigour in the very streets; and when I got free of

<P>the town, when my foot was on the sands and my face towards the

<P>broad, bright bay, no language can describe the effect of the deep,

<P>clear azure of the sky and ocean, the bright morning sunshine on

<P>the semicircular barrier of craggy cliffs surmounted by green

<P>swelling hills, and on the smooth, wide sands, and the low rocks

<P>out at sea - looking, with their clothing of weeds and moss, like

<P>little grass-grown islands - and above all, on the brilliant,

<P>sparkling waves.&nbsp; And then, the unspeakable purity - and freshness

<P>of the air!&nbsp; There was just enough heat to enhance the value of
the

<P>breeze, and just enough wind to keep the whole sea in motion, to

<P>make the waves come bounding to the shore, foaming and sparkling,

<P>as if wild with glee.&nbsp; Nothing else was stirring - no living

<P>creature was visible besides myself.&nbsp; My footsteps were the first

<P>to press the firm, unbroken sands; - nothing before had trampled

<P>them since last night's flowing tide had obliterated the deepest

<P>marks of yesterday, and left them fair and even, except where the

<P>subsiding water had left behind it the traces of dimpled pools and

<P>little running streams.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Refreshed, delighted, invigorated, I walked along, forgetting all

<P>my cares, feeling as if I had wings to my feet, and could go at

<P>least forty miles without fatigue, and experiencing a sense of

<P>exhilaration to which I had been an entire stranger since the days

<P>of early youth.&nbsp; About half-past six, however, the grooms began
to

<P>come down to air their masters' horses - first one, and then

<P>another, till there were some dozen horses and five or six riders:

<P>but that need not trouble me, for they would not come as far as the

<P>low rocks which I was now approaching.&nbsp; When I had reached these,

<P>and walked over the moist, slippery sea-weed (at the risk of

<P>floundering into one of the numerous pools of clear, salt water

<P>that lay between them), to a little mossy promontory with the sea

<P>splashing round it, I looked back again to see who next was

<P>stirring.&nbsp; Still, there were only the early grooms with their

<P>horses, and one gentleman with a little dark speck of a dog running

<P>before him, and one water-cart coming out of the town to get water

<P>for the baths.&nbsp; In another minute or two, the distant bathing

<P>machines would begin to move, and then the elderly gentlemen of

<P>regular habits and sober quaker ladies would be coming to take

<P>their salutary morning walks.&nbsp; But however interesting such a scene

<P>might be, I could not wait to witness it, for the sun and the sea

<P>so dazzled my eyes in that direction, that I could but afford one

<P>glance; and then I turned again to delight myself with the sight

<P>and the sound of the sea, dashing against my promontory - with no

<P>prodigious force, for the swell was broken by the tangled sea-weed

<P>and the unseen rocks beneath; otherwise I should soon have been

<P>deluged with spray.&nbsp; But the tide was coming in; the water was

<P>rising; the gulfs and lakes were filling; the straits were

<P>widening:&nbsp; it was time to seek some safer footing; so I walked,

<P>skipped, and stumbled back to the smooth, wide sands, and resolved

<P>to proceed to a certain bold projection in the cliffs, and then

<P>return.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently, I heard a snuffling sound behind me and then a dog came

<P>frisking and wriggling to my feet.&nbsp; It was my own Snap - the little

<P>dark, wire-haired terrier!&nbsp; When I spoke his name, he leapt up
in

<P>my face and yelled for joy.&nbsp; Almost as much delighted as himself,
I

<P>caught the little creature in my arms, and kissed him repeatedly.

<P>But how came he to be there?&nbsp; He could not have dropped from the

<P>sky, or come all that way alone:&nbsp; it must be either his master,
the

<P>rat-catcher, or somebody else that had brought him; so, repressing

<P>my extravagant caresses, and endeavouring to repress his likewise,

<P>I looked round, and beheld - Mr. Weston!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Your dog remembers you well, Miss Grey,' said he, warmly grasping

<P>the hand I offered him without clearly knowing what I was about.

<P>'You rise early.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Not often so early as this,' I replied, with amazing composure,

<P>considering all the circumstances of the case.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How far do you purpose to extend your walk?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I was thinking of returning - it must be almost time, I think.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He consulted his watch - a gold one now - and told me it was only

<P>five minutes past seven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, doubtless, you have had a long enough walk,' said he, turning

<P>towards the town, to which I now proceeded leisurely to retrace my

<P>steps; and he walked beside me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'In what part of the town do you live?' asked he.&nbsp; 'I never could

<P>discover.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Never could discover?&nbsp; Had he endeavoured to do so then?&nbsp;
I told

<P>him the place of our abode.&nbsp; He asked how we prospered in our

<P>affairs.&nbsp; I told him we were doing very well - that we had had
a

<P>considerable addition to our pupils after the Christmas vacation,

<P>and expected a still further increase at the close of this.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You must be an accomplished instructor,' he observed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, it is my mother,' I replied; 'she manages things so well, and

<P>is so active, and clever, and kind.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I should like to know your mother.&nbsp; Will you introduce me to her

<P>some time, if I call?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, willingly.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking

<P>in upon you now and then?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, if - I suppose so.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a very foolish answer, but the truth was, I considered

<P>that I had no right to invite anyone to my mother's house without

<P>her knowledge; and if I had said, 'Yes, if my mother does not

<P>object,' it would appear as if by his question I understood more

<P>than was expected; so, SUPPOSING she would not, I added, 'I suppose

<P>so:' but of course I should have said something more sensible and

<P>more polite, if I had had my wits about me.&nbsp; We continued our walk

<P>for a minute in silence; which, however, was shortly relieved (no

<P>small relief to me) by Mr. Weston commenting upon the brightness of

<P>the morning and the beauty of the bay, and then upon the advantages

<P>A- possessed over many other fashionable places of resort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You don't ask what brings me to A- ' said he.&nbsp; 'You can't suppose

<P>I'm rich enough to come for my own pleasure.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I heard you had left Horton.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You didn't hear, then, that I had got the living of F-?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>F- was a village about two miles distant from A-.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No,' said I; 'we live so completely out of the world, even here,

<P>that news seldom reaches me through any quarter; except through the

<P>medium of the - GAZETTE.&nbsp; But I hope you like your new parish;
and

<P>that I may congratulate you on the acquisition?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I expect to like my parish better a year or two hence, when I have

<P>worked certain reforms I have set my heart upon - or, at least,

<P>progressed some steps towards such an achievement.&nbsp; But you may

<P>congratulate me now; for I find it very agreeable to HAVE a parish

<P>all to myself, with nobody to interfere with me - to thwart my

<P>plans or cripple my exertions:&nbsp; and besides, I have a respectable

<P>house in a rather pleasant neighbourhood, and three hundred pounds

<P>a year; and, in fact, I have nothing but solitude to complain of,

<P>and nothing but a companion to wish for.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked at me as he concluded:&nbsp; and the flash of his dark eyes

<P>seemed to set my face on fire; greatly to my own discomfiture, for

<P>to evince confusion at such a juncture was intolerable.&nbsp; I made
an

<P>effort, therefore, to remedy the evil, and disclaim all personal

<P>application of the remark by a hasty, ill-expressed reply, to the

<P>effect that, if he waited till he was well known in the

<P>neighbourhood, he might have numerous opportunities for supplying

<P>his want among the residents of F- and its vicinity, or the

<P>visitors of A-, if he required so ample a choice:&nbsp; not considering

<P>the compliment implied by such an assertion, till his answer made

<P>me aware of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I am not so presumptuous as to believe that,' said he, 'though you

<P>tell it me; but if it were so, I am rather particular in my notions

<P>of a companion for life, and perhaps I might not find one to suit

<P>me among the ladies you mention.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'If you require perfection, you never will.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I do not - I have no right to require it, as being so far from

<P>perfect myself.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here the conversation was interrupted by a water-cart lumbering

<P>past us, for we were now come to the busy part of the sands; and,

<P>for the next eight or ten minutes, between carts and horses, and

<P>asses, and men, there was little room for social intercourse, till

<P>we had turned our backs upon the sea, and begun to ascend the

<P>precipitous road leading into the town.&nbsp; Here my companion offered

<P>me his arm, which I accepted, though not with the intention of

<P>using it as a support.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You don't often come on to the sands, I think,' said he, 'for I

<P>have walked there many times, both morning and evening, since I

<P>came, and never seen you till now; and several times, in passing

<P>through the town, too, I have looked about for your school - but I

<P>did not think of the - Road; and once or twice I made inquiries,

<P>but without obtaining the requisite information.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When we had surmounted the acclivity, I was about to withdraw my

<P>arm from his, but by a slight tightening of the elbow was tacitly

<P>informed that such was not his will, and accordingly desisted.

<P>Discoursing on different subjects, we entered the town, and passed

<P>through several streets.&nbsp; I saw that he was going out of his way
to

<P>accompany me, notwithstanding the long walk that was yet before

<P>him; and, fearing that he might be inconveniencing himself from

<P>motives of politeness, I observed - 'I fear I am taking you out of

<P>your way, Mr. Weston - I believe the road to F- lies quite in

<P>another direction.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I'll leave you at the end of the next street,' said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And when will you come to see mamma?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To-morrow - God willing.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The end of the next street was nearly the conclusion of my journey.

<P>He stopped there, however, bid me good-morning, and called Snap,

<P>who seemed a little doubtful whether to follow his old mistress or

<P>his new master, but trotted away upon being summoned by the latter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I won't offer to restore him to you, Miss Grey,' said Mr. Weston,

<P>smiling, 'because I like him.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, I don't want him,' replied I, 'now that he has a good master;

<P>I'm quite satisfied.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You take it for granted that I am a good one, then?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man and the dog departed, and I returned home, full of

<P>gratitude to heaven for so much bliss, and praying that my hopes

<P>might not again be crushed.
