<P>THE following day was as fine as the preceding one.&nbsp; Soon after

<P>breakfast Miss Matilda, having galloped and blundered through a few

<P>unprofitable lessons, and vengeably thumped the piano for an hour,

<P>in a terrible humour with both me and it, because her mamma would

<P>not give her a holiday, had betaken herself to her favourite places

<P>of resort, the yards, the stables, and the dog-kennels; and Miss

<P>Murray was gone forth to enjoy a quiet ramble with a new

<P>fashionable novel for her companion, leaving me in the schoolroom

<P>hard at work upon a water-colour drawing which I had promised to do

<P>for her, and which she insisted upon my finishing that day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At my feet lay a little rough terrier.&nbsp; It was the property of
Miss

<P>Matilda; but she hated the animal, and intended to sell it,

<P>alleging that it was quite spoiled.&nbsp; It was really an excellent
dog

<P>of its kind; but she affirmed it was fit for nothing, and had not

<P>even the sense to know its own mistress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fact was she had purchased it when but a small puppy, insisting

<P>at first that no one should touch it but herself; but soon becoming

<P>tired of so helpless and troublesome a nursling, she had gladly

<P>yielded to my entreaties to be allowed to take charge of it; and I,

<P>by carefully nursing the little creature from infancy to

<P>adolescence, of course, had obtained its affections:&nbsp; a reward
I

<P>should have greatly valued, and looked upon as far outweighing all

<P>the trouble I had had with it, had not poor Snap's grateful

<P>feelings exposed him to many a harsh word and many a spiteful kick

<P>and pinch from his owner, and were he not now in danger of being

<P>'put away' in consequence, or transferred to some rough, stony-

<P>hearted master.&nbsp; But how could I help it?&nbsp; I could not make
the dog

<P>hate me by cruel treatment, and she would not propitiate him by

<P>kindness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However, while I thus sat, working away with my pencil, Mrs. Murray

<P>came, half-sailing, half-bustling, into the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Miss Grey,' she began, - 'dear! how can you sit at your drawing

<P>such a day as this?'&nbsp; (She thought I was doing it for my own

<P>pleasure.)&nbsp; 'I WONDER you don't put on your bonnet and go out with

<P>the young ladies.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I think, ma'am, Miss Murray is reading; and Miss Matilda is

<P>amusing herself with her dogs.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'If you would try to amuse Miss Matilda yourself a little more, I

<P>think she would not be driven to seek amusement in the

<P>companionship of dogs and horses and grooms, so much as she is; and

<P>if you would be a little more cheerful and conversable with Miss

<P>Murray, she would not so often go wandering in the fields with a

<P>book in her hand.&nbsp; However, I don't want to vex you,' added she,

<P>seeing, I suppose, that my cheeks burned and my hand trembled with

<P>some unamiable emotion.&nbsp; 'Do, pray, try not to be so touchy -

<P>there's no speaking to you else.&nbsp; And tell me if you know where

<P>Rosalie is gone:&nbsp; and why she likes to be so much alone?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'She says she likes to be alone when she has a new book to read.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But why can't she read it in the park or the garden? - why should

<P>she go into the fields and lanes?&nbsp; And how is it that that Mr.

<P>Hatfield so often finds her out?&nbsp; She told me last week he'd walked

<P>his horse by her side all up Moss Lane; and now I'm sure it was he

<P>I saw, from my dressing-room window, walking so briskly past the

<P>park-gates, and on towards the field where she so frequently goes.

<P>I wish you would go and see if she is there; and just gently remind

<P>her that it is not proper for a young lady of her rank and

<P>prospects to be wandering about by herself in that manner, exposed

<P>to the attentions of anyone that presumes to address her; like some

<P>poor neglected girl that has no park to walk in, and no friends to

<P>take care of her:&nbsp; and tell her that her papa would be extremely

<P>angry if he knew of her treating Mr. Hatfield in the familiar

<P>manner that I fear she does; and - oh! if you - if ANY governess

<P>had but half a mother's watchfulness - half a mother's anxious

<P>care, I should be saved this trouble; and you would see at once the

<P>necessity of keeping your eye upon her, and making your company

<P>agreeable to -&nbsp; Well, go - go; there's no time to be lost,' cried

<P>she, seeing that I had put away my drawing materials, and was

<P>waiting in the doorway for the conclusion of her address.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>According to her prognostications, I found Miss Murray in her

<P>favourite field just without the park; and, unfortunately, not

<P>alone; for the tall, stately figure of Mr. Hatfield was slowly

<P>sauntering by her side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was a poser for me.&nbsp; It was my duty to interrupt the TETE-A-

<P>TETE:&nbsp; but how was it to be done?&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield could not
to be

<P>driven away by so insignificant person as I; and to go and place

<P>myself on the other side of Miss Murray, and intrude my unwelcome

<P>presence upon her without noticing her companion, was a piece of

<P>rudeness I could not be guilty of:&nbsp; neither had I the courage to

<P>cry aloud from the top of the field that she was wanted elsewhere.

<P>So I took the intermediate course of walking slowly but steadily

<P>towards them; resolving, if my approach failed to scare away the

<P>beau, to pass by and tell Miss Murray her mamma wanted her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She certainly looked very charming as she strolled, lingering along

<P>under the budding horse-chestnut trees that stretched their long

<P>arms over the park-palings; with her closed book in one hand, and

<P>in the other a graceful sprig of myrtle, which served her as a very

<P>pretty plaything; her bright ringlets escaping profusely from her

<P>little bonnet, and gently stirred by the breeze, her fair cheek

<P>flushed with gratified vanity, her smiling blue eyes, now slyly

<P>glancing towards her admirer, now gazing downward at her myrtle

<P>sprig.&nbsp; But Snap, running before me, interrupted her in the midst

<P>of some half-pert, half-playful repartee, by catching hold of her

<P>dress and vehemently tugging thereat; till Mr. Hatfield, with his

<P>cane, administered a resounding thwack upon the animal's skull, and

<P>sent it yelping back to me with a clamorous outcry that afforded

<P>the reverend gentleman great amusement:&nbsp; but seeing me so near,
he

<P>thought, I suppose, he might as well be taking his departure; and,

<P>as I stooped to caress the dog, with ostentatious pity to show my

<P>disapproval of his severity, I heard him say:&nbsp; 'When shall I see

<P>you again, Miss Murray?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'At church, I suppose,' replied she, 'unless your business chances

<P>to bring you here again at the precise moment when I happen to be

<P>walking by.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I could always manage to have business here, if I knew precisely

<P>when and where to find you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But if I would, I could not inform you, for I am so immethodical,

<P>I never can tell to-day what I shall do tomorrow.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then give me that, meantime, to comfort me,' said he, half

<P>jestingly and half in earnest, extending his hand for the sprig of

<P>myrtle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, indeed, I shan't.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Do! PRAY do!&nbsp; I shall be the most miserable of men if you don't.

<P>You cannot be so cruel as to deny me a favour so easily granted and

<P>yet so highly prized!' pleaded he as ardently as if his life

<P>depended on it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By this time I stood within a very few yards of them, impatiently

<P>waiting his departure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'There then! take it and go,' said Rosalie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He joyfully received the gift, murmured something that made her

<P>blush and toss her head, but with a little laugh that showed her

<P>displeasure was entirely affected; and then with a courteous

<P>salutation withdrew.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Did you ever see such a man, Miss Grey?' said she, turning to me;

<P>'I'm so GLAD you came!&nbsp; I thought I never SHOULD, get rid of him;

<P>and I was so terribly afraid of papa seeing him.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Has he been with you long?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, not long, but he's so extremely impertinent:&nbsp; and he's always

<P>hanging about, pretending his business or his clerical duties

<P>require his attendance in these parts, and really watching for poor

<P>me, and pouncing upon me wherever he sees me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, your mamma thinks you ought not to go beyond the park or

<P>garden without some discreet, matronly person like me to accompany

<P>you, and keep off all intruders.&nbsp; She descried Mr. Hatfield

<P>hurrying past the park-gates, and forthwith despatched me with

<P>instructions to seek you up and to take care of you, and likewise

<P>to warn - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, mamma's so tiresome!&nbsp; As if I couldn't take care of myself.

<P>She bothered me before about Mr. Hatfield; and I told her she might

<P>trust me:&nbsp; I never should forget my rank and station for the most

<P>delightful man that ever breathed.&nbsp; I wish he would go down on
his

<P>knees to-morrow, and implore me to be his wife, that I might just

<P>show her how mistaken she is in supposing that I could ever - Oh,

<P>it provokes me so!&nbsp; To think that I could be such a fool as to
fall

<P>in LOVE!&nbsp; It is quite beneath the dignity of a woman to do such
a

<P>thing.&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; I detest the word!&nbsp; As applied to one
of our sex, I

<P>think it a perfect insult.&nbsp; A preference I MIGHT acknowledge; but

<P>never for one like poor Mr. Hatfield, who has not seven hundred a

<P>year to bless himself with.&nbsp; I like to talk to him, because he's
so

<P>clever and amusing - I wish Sir Thomas Ashby were half as nice;

<P>besides, I must have SOMEBODY to flirt with, and no one else has

<P>the sense to come here; and when we go out, mamma won't let me

<P>flirt with anybody but Sir Thomas - if he's there; and if he's NOT

<P>there, I'm bound hand and foot, for fear somebody should go and

<P>make up some exaggerated story, and put it into his head that I'm

<P>engaged, or likely to be engaged, to somebody else; or, what is

<P>more probable, for fear his nasty old mother should see or hear of

<P>my ongoings, and conclude that I'm not a fit wife for her excellent

<P>son:&nbsp; as if the said son were not the greatest scamp in

<P>Christendom; and as if any woman of common decency were not a world

<P>too good for him.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Is it really so, Miss Murray? and does your mamma know it, and yet

<P>wish you to marry him?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To be sure, she does!&nbsp; She knows more against him than I do, I

<P>believe:&nbsp; she keeps it from me lest I should be discouraged; not

<P>knowing how little I care about such things.&nbsp; For it's no great

<P>matter, really:&nbsp; he'll be all right when he's married, as mamma

<P>says; and reformed rakes make the best husbands, EVERYBODY knows.

<P>I only wish he were not so ugly - THAT'S all I think about:&nbsp; but

<P>then there's no choice here in the country; and papa WILL NOT let

<P>us go to London - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But I should think Mr. Hatfield would be far better.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And so he would, if he were lord of Ashby Park - there's not a

<P>doubt of it:&nbsp; but the fact is, I MUST have Ashby Park, whoever

<P>shares it with me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But Mr. Hatfield thinks you like him all this time; you don't

<P>consider how bitterly he will be disappointed when he finds himself

<P>mistaken.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'NO, indeed!&nbsp; It will be a proper punishment for his presumption
-

<P>for ever DARING to think I could like him.&nbsp; I should enjoy nothing

<P>so much as lifting the veil from his eyes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The sooner you do it the better then.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; I tell you, I like to amuse myself with him.&nbsp; Besides, he

<P>doesn't really think I like him.&nbsp; I take good care of that:&nbsp;
you

<P>don't know how cleverly I manage.&nbsp; He may presume to think he can

<P>induce me to like him; for which I shall punish him as he

<P>deserves.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, mind you don't give too much reason for such presumption -

<P>that's all,' replied I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But all my exhortations were in vain:&nbsp; they only made her somewhat

<P>more solicitous to disguise her wishes and her thoughts from me.

<P>She talked no more to me about the Rector; but I could see that her

<P>mind, if not her heart, was fixed upon him still, and that she was

<P>intent upon obtaining another interview:&nbsp; for though, in compliance

<P>with her mother's request, I was now constituted the companion of

<P>her rambles for a time, she still persisted in wandering in the

<P>fields and lanes that lay in the nearest proximity to the road;

<P>and, whether she talked to me or read the book she carried in her

<P>hand, she kept continually pausing to look round her, or gaze up

<P>the road to see if anyone was coming; and if a horseman trotted by,

<P>I could tell by her unqualified abuse of the poor equestrian,

<P>whoever he might be, that she hated him BECAUSE he was not Mr.

<P>Hatfield.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Surely,' thought I, 'she is not so indifferent to him as she

<P>believes herself to be, or would have others to believe her; and

<P>her mother's anxiety is not so wholly causeless as she affirms.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Three days passed away, and he did not make his appearance.&nbsp; On
the

<P>afternoon of the fourth, as we were walking beside the park-palings

<P>in the memorable field, each furnished with a book (for I always

<P>took care to provide myself with something to be doing when she did

<P>not require me to talk), she suddenly interrupted my studies by

<P>exclaiming -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Miss Grey! do be so kind as to go and see Mark Wood, and take

<P>his wife half-a-crown from me - I should have given or sent it a

<P>week ago, but quite forgot.&nbsp; There!' said she, throwing me her

<P>purse, and speaking very fast - 'Never mind getting it out now, but

<P>take the purse and give them what you like; I would go with you,

<P>but I want to finish this volume.&nbsp; I'll come and meet you when
I've

<P>done it.&nbsp; Be quick, will you - and - oh, wait; hadn't you better

<P>read to him a bit?&nbsp; Run to the house and get some sort of a good

<P>book.&nbsp; Anything will do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I did as I was desired; but, suspecting something from her hurried

<P>manner and the suddenness of the request, I just glanced back

<P>before I quitted the field, and there was Mr. Hatfield about to

<P>enter at the gate below.&nbsp; By sending me to the house for a book,

<P>she had just prevented my meeting him on the road.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Never mind!' thought I, 'there'll be no great harm done.&nbsp; Poor

<P>Mark will be glad of the half-crown, and perhaps of the good book

<P>too; and if the Rector does steal Miss Rosalie's heart, it will

<P>only humble her pride a little; and if they do get married at last,

<P>it will only save her from a worse fate; and she will be quite a

<P>good enough partner for him, and he for her.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mark Wood was the consumptive labourer whom I mentioned before.&nbsp;
He

<P>was now rapidly wearing away.&nbsp; Miss Murray, by her liberality,

<P>obtained literally the blessing of him that was ready to perish;

<P>for though the half-crown could be of very little service to him,

<P>he was glad of it for the sake of his wife and children, so soon to

<P>be widowed and fatherless.&nbsp; After I had sat a few minutes, and
read

<P>a little for the comfort and edification of himself and his

<P>afflicted wife, I left them; but I had not proceeded fifty yards

<P>before I encountered Mr. Weston, apparently on his way to the same

<P>abode.&nbsp; He greeted me in his usual quiet, unaffected way, stopped

<P>to inquire about the condition of the sick man and his family, and

<P>with a sort of unconscious, brotherly disregard to ceremony took

<P>from my hand the book out of which I had been reading, turned over

<P>its pages, made a few brief but very sensible remarks, and restored

<P>it; then told me about some poor sufferer he had just been

<P>visiting, talked a little about Nancy Brown, made a few

<P>observations upon my little rough friend the terrier, that was

<P>frisking at his feet, and finally upon the beauty of the weather,

<P>and departed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I have omitted to give a detail of his words, from a notion that

<P>they would not interest the reader as they did me, and not because

<P>I have forgotten them.&nbsp; No; I remember them well; for I thought

<P>them over and over again in the course of that day and many

<P>succeeding ones, I know not how often; and recalled every

<P>intonation of his deep, clear voice, every flash of his quick,

<P>brown eye, and every gleam of his pleasant, but too transient

<P>smile.&nbsp; Such a confession will look very absurd, I fear:&nbsp;
but no

<P>matter:&nbsp; I have written it:&nbsp; and they that read it will not
know

<P>the writer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While I was walking along, happy within, and pleased with all

<P>around, Miss Murray came hastening to meet me; her buoyant step,

<P>flushed cheek, and radiant smiles showing that she, too, was happy,

<P>in her own way.&nbsp; Running up to me, she put her arm through mine,

<P>and without waiting to recover breath, began - 'Now, Miss Grey,

<P>think yourself highly honoured, for I'm come to tell you my news

<P>before I've breathed a word of it to anyone else.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, what is it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, SUCH news!&nbsp; In the first place, you must know that Mr.

<P>Hatfield came upon me just after you were gone.&nbsp; I was in such
a

<P>way for fear papa or mamma should see him; but you know I couldn't

<P>call you back again, and so! - oh, dear!&nbsp; I can't tell you all

<P>about it now, for there's Matilda, I see, in the park, and I must

<P>go and open my budget to her.&nbsp; But, however, Hatfield was most

<P>uncommonly audacious, unspeakably complimentary, and

<P>unprecedentedly tender - tried to be so, at least - he didn't

<P>succeed very well in THAT, because it's not his vein.&nbsp; I'll tell

<P>you all he said another time.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But what did YOU say - I'm more interested in that?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I'll tell you that, too, at some future period.&nbsp; I happened to
be

<P>in a very good humour just then; but, though I was complaisant and

<P>gracious enough, I took care not to compromise myself in any

<P>possible way.&nbsp; But, however, the conceited wretch chose to

<P>interpret my amiability of temper his own way, and at length

<P>presumed upon my indulgence so far - what do you think? - he

<P>actually made me an offer!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And you - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I proudly drew myself up, and with the greatest coolness expressed

<P>my astonishment at such an occurrence, and hoped he had seen

<P>nothing in my conduct to justify his expectations.&nbsp; You should
have

<P>SEEN how his countenance fell!&nbsp; He went perfectly white in the

<P>face.&nbsp; I assured him that I esteemed him and all that, but could

<P>not possibly accede to his proposals; and if I did, papa and mamma

<P>could never be brought to give their consent.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"But if they could," said he, "would yours be wanting?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Certainly, Mr. Hatfield," I replied, with a cool decision which

<P>quelled all hope at once.&nbsp; Oh, if you had seen how dreadfully

<P>mortified he was - how crushed to the earth by his disappointment!

<P>really, I almost pitied him myself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'One more desperate attempt, however, he made.&nbsp; After a silence
of

<P>considerable duration, during which he struggled to be calm, and I

<P>to be grave - for I felt a strong propensity to laugh - which would

<P>have ruined all - he said, with the ghost of a smile - "But tell me

<P>plainly, Miss Murray, if I had the wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham, or

<P>the prospects of his eldest son, would you still refuse me?&nbsp; Answer

<P>me truly, upon your honour."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Certainly," said I.&nbsp; "That would make no difference whatever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It was a great lie, but he looked so confident in his own

<P>attractions still, that I determined not to leave him one stone

<P>upon another.&nbsp; He looked me full in the face; but I kept my

<P>countenance so well that he could not imagine I was saying anything

<P>more than the actual truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Then it's all over, I suppose," he said, looking as if he could

<P>have died on the spot with vexation and the intensity of his

<P>despair.&nbsp; But he was angry as well as disappointed.&nbsp; There
was he,

<P>suffering so unspeakably, and there was I, the pitiless cause of it

<P>all, so utterly impenetrable to all the artillery of his looks and

<P>words, so calmly cold and proud, he could not but feel some

<P>resentment; and with singular bitterness he began - "I certainly

<P>did not expect this, Miss Murray.&nbsp; I might say something about
your

<P>past conduct, and the hopes you have led me to foster, but I

<P>forbear, on condition - "
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"No conditions, Mr. Hatfield!" said I, now truly indignant at his

<P>insolence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Then let me beg it as a favour," he replied, lowering his voice

<P>at once, and taking a humbler tone:&nbsp; "let me entreat that you will

<P>not mention this affair to anyone whatever.&nbsp; If you will keep

<P>silence about it, there need be no unpleasantness on either side -

<P>nothing, I mean, beyond what is quite unavoidable:&nbsp; for my own

<P>feelings I will endeavour to keep to myself, if I cannot annihilate

<P>them - I will try to forgive, if I cannot forget the cause of my

<P>sufferings.&nbsp; I will not suppose, Miss Murray, that you know how

<P>deeply you have injured me.&nbsp; I would not have you aware of it;
but

<P>if, in addition to the injury you have already done me - pardon me,

<P>but, whether innocently or not, you HAVE done it - and if you add

<P>to it by giving publicity to this unfortunate affair, or naming it

<P>AT ALL, you will find that I too can speak, and though you scorned

<P>my love, you will hardly scorn my - "
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He stopped, but he bit his bloodless lip, and looked so terribly

<P>fierce that I was quite frightened.&nbsp; However, my pride upheld me

<P>still, and I answered disdainfully; "I do not know what motive you

<P>suppose I could have for naming it to anyone, Mr. Hatfield; but if

<P>I were disposed to do so, you would not deter me by threats; and it

<P>is scarcely the part of a gentleman to attempt it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Pardon me, Miss Murray," said he, "I have loved you so intensely

<P>- I do still adore you so deeply, that I would not willingly offend

<P>you; but though I never have loved, and never CAN love any woman as

<P>I have loved you, it is equally certain that I never was so ill-

<P>treated by any.&nbsp; On the contrary, I have always found your sex
the

<P>kindest and most tender and obliging of God's creation, till now."

<P>(Think of the conceited fellow saying that!)&nbsp; "And the novelty
and

<P>harshness of the lesson you have taught me to-day, and the

<P>bitterness of being disappointed in the only quarter on which the

<P>happiness of my life depended, must excuse any appearance of

<P>asperity.&nbsp; If my presence is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray,"
he

<P>said (for I was looking about me to show how little I cared for

<P>him, so he thought I was tired of him, I suppose) - "if my presence

<P>is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray, you have only to promise me

<P>the favour I named, and I will relieve you at once.&nbsp; There are
many

<P>ladies - some even in this parish - who would be delighted to

<P>accept what you have so scornfully trampled under your feet.&nbsp; They

<P>would be naturally inclined to hate one whose surpassing loveliness

<P>has so completely estranged my heart from them and blinded me to

<P>their attractions; and a single hint of the truth from me to one of

<P>these would be sufficient to raise such a talk against you as would

<P>seriously injure your prospects, and diminish your chance of

<P>success with any other gentleman you or your mamma might design to

<P>entangle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"What do your mean, sir?" said I, ready to stamp with passion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"I mean that this affair from beginning to end appears to me like

<P>a case of arrant flirtation, to say the least of it - such a case

<P>as you would find it rather inconvenient to have blazoned through

<P>the world:&nbsp; especially with the additions and exaggerations of
your

<P>female rivals, who would be too glad to publish the matter, if I

<P>only gave them a handle to it.&nbsp; But I promise you, on the faith
of

<P>a gentleman, that no word or syllable that could tend to your

<P>prejudice shall ever escape my lips, provided you will - "
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Well, well, I won't mention it," said I.&nbsp; "You may rely upon
my

<P>silence, if that can afford you any consolation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"You promise it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Yes," I answered; for I wanted to get rid of him now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Farewell, then!" said he, in a most doleful, heart-sick tone; and

<P>with a look where pride vainly struggled against despair, he turned

<P>and went away:&nbsp; longing, no doubt, to get home, that he might shut

<P>himself up in his study and cry - if he doesn't burst into tears

<P>before he gets there.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you have broken your promise already,' said I, truly horrified

<P>at her perfidy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh! it's only to you; I know you won't repeat it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Certainly, I shall not:&nbsp; but you say you are going to tell your

<P>sister; and she will tell your brothers when they come home, and

<P>Brown immediately, if you do not tell her yourself; and Brown will

<P>blazon it, or be the means of blazoning it, throughout the

<P>country.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, indeed, she won't.&nbsp; We shall not tell her at all, unless it
be

<P>under the promise of the strictest secrecy.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her

<P>more enlightened mistress?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, well, she shan't hear it then,' said Miss Murray, somewhat

<P>snappishly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you will tell your mamma, of course,' pursued I; 'and she will

<P>tell your papa.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Of course I shall tell mamma - that is the very thing that pleases

<P>me so much.&nbsp; I shall now be able to convince her how mistaken she

<P>was in her fears about me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, THAT'S it, is it?&nbsp; I was wondering what it was that delighted

<P>you so much.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes; and another thing is, that I've humbled Mr. Hatfield so

<P>charmingly; and another - why, you must allow me some share of

<P>female vanity:&nbsp; I don't pretend to be without that most essential

<P>attribute of our sex - and if you had seen poor Hatfield's intense

<P>eagerness in making his ardent declaration and his flattering

<P>proposal, and his agony of mind, that no effort of pride could

<P>conceal, on being refused, you would have allowed I had some cause

<P>to be gratified.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The greater his agony, I should think, the less your cause for

<P>gratification.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, nonsense!' cried the young lady, shaking herself with

<P>vexation.&nbsp; 'You either can't understand me, or you won't.&nbsp;
If I had

<P>not confidence in your magnanimity, I should think you envied me.

<P>But you will, perhaps, comprehend this cause of pleasure - which is

<P>as great as any - namely, that I am delighted with myself for my

<P>prudence, my self-command, my heartlessness, if you please.&nbsp; I
was

<P>not a bit taken by surprise, not a bit confused, or awkward, or

<P>foolish; I just acted and spoke as I ought to have done, and was

<P>completely my own mistress throughout.&nbsp; And here was a man,

<P>decidedly good-looking - Jane and Susan Green call him bewitchingly

<P>handsome I suppose they're two of the ladies he pretends would be

<P>so glad to have him; but, however, he was certainly a very clever,

<P>witty, agreeable companion - not what you call clever, but just

<P>enough to make him entertaining; and a man one needn't be ashamed

<P>of anywhere, and would not soon grow tired of; and to confess the

<P>truth, I rather liked him - better even, of late, than Harry

<P>Meltham - and he evidently idolised me; and yet, though he came

<P>upon me all alone and unprepared, I had the wisdom, and the pride,

<P>and the strength to refuse him - and so scornfully and coolly as I

<P>did:&nbsp; I have good reason to be proud of that.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And are you equally proud of having told him that his having the

<P>wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham would make no difference to you, when

<P>that was not the case; and of having promised to tell no one of his

<P>misadventure, apparently without the slightest intention of keeping

<P>your promise?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Of course! what else could I do?&nbsp; You would not have had me -
but

<P>I see, Miss Grey, you're not in a good temper.&nbsp; Here's Matilda;

<P>I'll see what she and mamma have to say about it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She left me, offended at my want of sympathy, and thinking, no

<P>doubt, that I envied her.&nbsp; I did not - at least, I firmly believed

<P>I did not.&nbsp; I was sorry for her; I was amazed, disgusted at her

<P>heartless vanity; I wondered why so much beauty should be given to

<P>those who made so bad a use of it, and denied to some who would

<P>make it a benefit to both themselves and others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, God knows best, I concluded.&nbsp; There are, I suppose, some men

<P>as vain, as selfish, and as heartless as she is, and, perhaps, such

<P>women may be useful to punish them.
