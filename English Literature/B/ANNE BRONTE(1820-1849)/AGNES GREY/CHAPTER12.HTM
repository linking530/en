<P>THE next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in

<P>March:&nbsp; for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I

<P>seldom could look upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where

<P>everything was left to the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister,

<P>there could be no order or regularity.&nbsp; Whatever occupation I

<P>chose, when not actually busied about them or their concerns, I

<P>had, as it were, to keep my loins girded, my shoes on my feet, and

<P>my staff in my hand; for not to be immediately forthcoming when

<P>called for, was regarded as a grave and inexcusable offence:&nbsp; not

<P>only by my pupils and their mother, but by the very servant, who

<P>came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming, 'You're to go to

<P>the schoolroom DIRECTLY, mum, the young ladies is WAITING!!'

<P>Climax of horror! actually waiting for their governess!!!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself; for

<P>Matilda was preparing for a long ride, and Rosalie was dressing for

<P>a dinner-party at Lady Ashby's:&nbsp; so I took the opportunity of

<P>repairing to the widow's cottage, where I found her in some anxiety

<P>about her cat, which had been absent all day.&nbsp; I comforted her
with

<P>as many anecdotes of that animal's roving propensities as I could

<P>recollect.&nbsp; 'I'm feared o' th' gamekeepers,' said she:&nbsp; 'that's
all

<P>'at I think on.&nbsp; If th' young gentlemen had been at home, I should

<P>a' thought they'd been setting their dogs at her, an' worried her,

<P>poor thing, as they did MANY a poor thing's cat; but I haven't that

<P>to be feared on now.'&nbsp; Nancy's eyes were better, but still far
from

<P>well:&nbsp; she had been trying to make a Sunday shirt for her son,
but

<P>told me she could only bear to do a little bit at it now and then,

<P>so that it progressed but slowly, though the poor lad wanted it

<P>sadly.&nbsp; So I proposed to help her a little, after I had read to

<P>her, for I had plenty of time that evening, and need not return

<P>till dusk.&nbsp; She thankfully accepted the offer.&nbsp; 'An' you'll
be a

<P>bit o' company for me too, Miss,' said she; 'I like as I feel

<P>lonesome without my cat.'&nbsp; But when I had finished reading, and

<P>done the half of a seam, with Nancy's capacious brass thimble

<P>fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of paper, I was disturbed

<P>by the entrance of Mr. Weston, with the identical cat in his arms.

<P>I now saw that he could smile, and very pleasantly too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I've done you a piece of good service, Nancy,' he began:&nbsp; then

<P>seeing me, he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow.&nbsp; I should

<P>have been invisible to Hatfield, or any other gentleman of those

<P>parts.&nbsp; 'I've delivered your cat,' he continued, 'from the hands,

<P>or rather the gun, of Mr. Murray's gamekeeper.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'God bless you, sir!' cried the grateful old woman, ready to weep

<P>for joy as she received her favourite from his arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Take care of it,' said he, 'and don't let it go near the rabbit-

<P>warren, for the gamekeeper swears he'll shoot it if he sees it

<P>there again:&nbsp; he would have done so to-day, if I had not been in

<P>time to stop him.&nbsp; I believe it is raining, Miss Grey,' added he,

<P>more quietly, observing that I had put aside my work, and was

<P>preparing to depart.&nbsp; 'Don't let me disturb you - I shan't stay
two

<P>minutes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You'll BOTH stay while this shower gets owered,' said Nancy, as

<P>she stirred the fire, and placed another chair beside it; 'what!

<P>there's room for all.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I can see better here, thank you, Nancy,' replied I, taking my

<P>work to the window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to

<P>remain unmolested, while she got a brush to remove the cat's hairs

<P>from Mr. Weston's coat, carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and

<P>gave the cat its supper, busily talking all the time:&nbsp; now thanking

<P>her clerical friend for what he had done; now wondering how the cat

<P>had found out the warren; and now lamenting the probable

<P>consequences of such a discovery.&nbsp; He listened with a quiet, good-

<P>natured smile, and at length took a seat in compliance with her

<P>pressing invitations, but repeated that he did not mean to stay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I have another place to go to,' said he, 'and I see' (glancing at

<P>the book on the table) 'someone else has been reading to you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, sir; Miss Grey has been as kind as read me a chapter; an' now

<P>she's helping me with a shirt for our Bill - but I'm feared she'll

<P>be cold there.&nbsp; Won't you come to th' fire, Miss?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, thank you, Nancy, I'm quite warm.&nbsp; I must go as soon as this

<P>shower is over.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Miss!&nbsp; You said you could stop while dusk!' cried the

<P>provoking old woman, and Mr. Weston seized his hat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Nay, sir,' exclaimed she, 'pray don't go now, while it rains so

<P>fast.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But it strikes me I'm keeping your visitor away from the fire.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, you're not, Mr. Weston,' replied I, hoping there was no harm

<P>in a falsehood of that description.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, sure!' cried Nancy.&nbsp; 'What, there's lots o' room!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Miss Grey,' said he, half-jestingly, as if he felt it necessary to

<P>change the present subject, whether he had anything particular to

<P>say or not, 'I wish you would make my peace with the squire, when

<P>you see him.&nbsp; He was by when I rescued Nancy's cat, and did not

<P>quite approve of the deed.&nbsp; I told him I thought he might better

<P>spare all his rabbits than she her cat, for which audacious

<P>assertion he treated me to some rather ungentlemanly language; and

<P>I fear I retorted a trifle too warmly.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, lawful sir!&nbsp; I hope you didn't fall out wi' th' maister for

<P>sake o' my cat! he cannot bide answering again - can th' maister.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh! it's no matter, Nancy:&nbsp; I don't care about it, really; I said

<P>nothing VERY uncivil; and I suppose Mr. Murray is accustomed to use

<P>rather strong language when he's heated.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ay, sir:&nbsp; it's a pity.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And now, I really must go.&nbsp; I have to visit a place a mile beyond

<P>this; and you would not have me to return in the dark:&nbsp; besides,
it

<P>has nearly done raining now - so good-evening, Nancy.&nbsp; Good-

<P>evening, Miss Grey.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Good-evening, Mr. Weston; but don't depend upon me for making your

<P>peace with Mr. Murray, for I never see him - to speak to.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Don't you; it can't be helped then,' replied he, in dolorous

<P>resignation:&nbsp; then, with a peculiar half-smile, he added, 'But

<P>never mind; I imagine the squire has more to apologise for than I;'

<P>and left the cottage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I went on with my sewing as long as I could see, and then bade

<P>Nancy good-evening; checking her too lively gratitude by the

<P>undeniable assurance that I had only done for her what she would

<P>have done for me, if she had been in my place and I in hers.&nbsp; I

<P>hastened back to Horton Lodge, where, having entered the

<P>schoolroom, I found the tea-table all in confusion, the tray

<P>flooded with slops, and Miss Matilda in a most ferocious humour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Miss Grey, whatever have you been about?&nbsp; I've had tea half an

<P>hour ago, and had to make it myself, and drink it all alone!&nbsp; I

<P>wish you would come in sooner!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I've been to see Nancy Brown.&nbsp; I thought you would not be back

<P>from your ride.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How could I ride in the rain, I should like to know.&nbsp; That damned

<P>pelting shower was vexatious enough - coming on when I was just in

<P>full swing:&nbsp; and then to come and find nobody in to tea! and you

<P>know I can't make the tea as I like it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I didn't think of the shower,' replied I (and, indeed, the thought

<P>of its driving her home had never entered my head).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, of course; you were under shelter yourself, and you never

<P>thought of other people.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I bore her coarse reproaches with astonishing equanimity, even with

<P>cheerfulness; for I was sensible that I had done more good to Nancy

<P>Brown than harm to her:&nbsp; and perhaps some other thoughts assisted

<P>to keep up my spirits, and impart a relish to the cup of cold,

<P>overdrawn tea, and a charm to the otherwise unsightly table; and -

<P>I had almost said - to Miss Matilda's unamiable face.&nbsp; But she
soon

<P>betook herself to the stables, and left me to the quiet enjoyment

<P>of my solitary meal.
