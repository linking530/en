<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FOR a few months I remained peaceably at home, in the quiet

<P>enjoyment of liberty and rest, and genuine friendship, from all of

<P>which I had fasted so long; and in the earnest prosecution of my

<P>studies, to recover what I had lost during my stay at Wellwood

<P>House, and to lay in new stores for future use.&nbsp; My father's health

<P>was still very infirm, but not materially worse than when I last

<P>saw him; and I was glad I had it in my power to cheer him by my

<P>return, and to amuse him with singing his favourite songs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No one triumphed over my failure, or said I had better have taken

<P>his or her advice, and quietly stayed at home.&nbsp; All were glad to

<P>have me back again, and lavished more kindness than ever upon me,

<P>to make up for the sufferings I had undergone; but not one would

<P>touch a shilling of what I had so cheerfully earned and so

<P>carefully saved, in the hope of sharing it with them.&nbsp; By dint
of

<P>pinching here, and scraping there, our debts were already nearly

<P>paid.&nbsp; Mary had had good success with her drawings; but our father

<P>had insisted upon HER likewise keeping all the produce of her

<P>industry to herself.&nbsp; All we could spare from the supply of our

<P>humble wardrobe and our little casual expenses, he directed us to

<P>put into the savings'-bank; saying, we knew not how soon we might

<P>be dependent on that alone for support:&nbsp; for he felt he had not

<P>long to be with us, and what would become of our mother and us when

<P>he was gone, God only knew!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear papa! if he had troubled himself less about the afflictions

<P>that threatened us in case of his death, I am convinced that

<P>dreaded event would not have taken place so soon.&nbsp; My mother would

<P>never suffer him to ponder on the subject if she could help it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Richard!' exclaimed she, on one occasion, 'if you would but

<P>dismiss such gloomy subjects from your mind, you would live as long

<P>as any of us; at least you would live to see the girls married, and

<P>yourself a happy grandfather, with a canty old dame for your

<P>companion.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My mother laughed, and so did my father:&nbsp; but his laugh soon

<P>perished in a dreary sigh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'THEY married - poor penniless things!' said he; 'who will take

<P>them I wonder!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why, nobody shall that isn't thankful for them.&nbsp; Wasn't I

<P>penniless when you took me? and you PRETENDED, at least, to be

<P>vastly pleased with your acquisition.&nbsp; But it's no matter whether

<P>they get married or not:&nbsp; we can devise a thousand honest ways
of

<P>making a livelihood.&nbsp; And I wonder, Richard, you can think of

<P>bothering your head about our POVERTY in case of your death; as if

<P>THAT would be anything compared with the calamity of losing you -

<P>an affliction that you well know would swallow up all others, and

<P>which you ought to do your utmost to preserve us from:&nbsp; and there

<P>is nothing like a cheerful mind for keeping the body in health.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I know, Alice, it is wrong to keep repining as I do, but I cannot

<P>help it:&nbsp; you must bear with me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I WON'T bear with you, if I can alter you,' replied my mother:

<P>but the harshness of her words was undone by the earnest affection

<P>of her tone and pleasant smile, that made my father smile again,

<P>less sadly and less transiently than was his wont.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mamma,' said I, as soon as I could find an opportunity of speaking

<P>with her alone, 'my money is but little, and cannot last long; if I

<P>could increase it, it would lessen papa's anxiety, on one subject

<P>at least.&nbsp; I cannot draw like Mary, and so the best thing I could

<P>do would be to look out for another situation.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And so you would actually try again, Agnes?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Decidedly, I would.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why, my dear, I should have thought you had had enough of it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I know,' said I, 'everybody is not like Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield -

<P>'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Some are worse,' interrupted my mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But not many, I think,' replied I, 'and I'm sure all children are

<P>not like theirs; for I and Mary were not:&nbsp; we always did as you
bid

<P>us, didn't we?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Generally:&nbsp; but then, I did not spoil you; and you were not

<P>perfect angels after all:&nbsp; Mary had a fund of quiet obstinacy,
and

<P>you were somewhat faulty in regard to temper; but you were very

<P>good children on the whole.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I know I was sulky sometimes, and I should have been glad to see

<P>these children sulky sometimes too; for then I could have

<P>understood them:&nbsp; but they never were, for they COULD not be

<P>offended, nor hurt, nor ashamed:&nbsp; they could not be unhappy in
any

<P>way, except when they were in a passion.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, if they COULD not, it was not their fault:&nbsp; you cannot

<P>expect stone to be as pliable as clay.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, but still it is very unpleasant to live with such

<P>unimpressible, incomprehensible creatures.&nbsp; You cannot love them;

<P>and if you could, your love would be utterly thrown away:&nbsp; they

<P>could neither return it, nor value, nor understand it.&nbsp; But,

<P>however, even if I should stumble on such a family again, which is

<P>quite unlikely, I have all this experience to begin with, and I

<P>should manage better another time; and the end and aim of this

<P>preamble is, let me try again.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, my girl, you are not easily discouraged, I see:&nbsp; I am glad

<P>of that.&nbsp; But, let me tell you, you are a good deal paler and

<P>thinner than when you first left home; and we cannot have you

<P>undermining your health to hoard up money either for yourself or

<P>others.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mary tells me I am changed too; and I don't much wonder at it, for

<P>I was in a constant state of agitation and anxiety all day long:

<P>but next time I am determined to take things coolly.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After some further discussion, my mother promised once more to

<P>assist me, provided I would wait and be patient; and I left her to

<P>broach the matter to my father, when and how she deemed it most

<P>advisable:&nbsp; never doubting her ability to obtain his consent.

<P>Meantime, I searched, with great interest, the advertising columns

<P>of the newspapers, and wrote answers to every 'Wanted a Governess'

<P>that appeared at all eligible; but all my letters, as well as the

<P>replies, when I got any, were dutifully shown to my mother; and

<P>she, to my chagrin, made me reject the situations one after

<P>another:&nbsp; these were low people, these were too exacting in their

<P>demands, and these too niggardly in their remuneration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Your talents are not such as every poor clergyman's daughter

<P>possesses, Agnes,' she would say, 'and you must not throw them

<P>away.&nbsp; Remember, you promised to be patient:&nbsp; there is no
need of

<P>hurry:&nbsp; you have plenty of time before you, and may have many

<P>chances yet.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At length, she advised me to put an advertisement, myself, in the

<P>paper, stating my qualifications, &amp;c.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Music, singing, drawing, French, Latin, and German,' said she,

<P>'are no mean assemblage:&nbsp; many will be glad to have so much in
one

<P>instructor; and this time, you shall try your fortune in a somewhat

<P>higher family in that of some genuine, thoroughbred gentleman; for

<P>such are far more likely to treat you with proper respect and

<P>consideration than those purse-proud tradespeople and arrogant

<P>upstarts.&nbsp; I have known several among the higher ranks who treated

<P>their governesses quite as one of the family; though some, I allow,

<P>are as insolent and exacting as any one else can be:&nbsp; for there
are

<P>bad and good in all classes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The advertisement was quickly written and despatched.&nbsp; Of the two

<P>parties who answered it, but one would consent to give me fifty

<P>pounds, the sum my mother bade me name as the salary I should

<P>require; and here, I hesitated about engaging myself, as I feared

<P>the children would be too old, and their parents would require some

<P>one more showy, or more experienced, if not more accomplished than

<P>I.&nbsp; But my mother dissuaded me from declining it on that account:

<P>I should do vastly well, she said, if I would only throw aside my

<P>diffidence, and acquire a little more confidence in myself.&nbsp; I
was

<P>just to give a plain, true statement of my acquirements and

<P>qualifications, and name what stipulations I chose to make, and

<P>then await the result.&nbsp; The only stipulation I ventured to propose,

<P>was that I might be allowed two months' holidays during the year to

<P>visit my friends, at Midsummer and Christmas.&nbsp; The unknown lady,
in

<P>her reply, made no objection to this, and stated that, as to my

<P>acquirements, she had no doubt I should be able to give

<P>satisfaction; but in the engagement of governesses she considered

<P>those things as but subordinate points; as being situated in the

<P>neighbourhood of O-, she could get masters to supply any

<P>deficiencies in that respect:&nbsp; but, in her opinion, next to

<P>unimpeachable morality, a mild and cheerful temper and obliging

<P>disposition were the most essential requisities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My mother did not relish this at all, and now made many objections

<P>to my accepting the situation; in which my sister warmly supported

<P>her:&nbsp; but, unwilling to be balked again, I overruled them all;
and,

<P>having first obtained the consent of my father (who had, a short

<P>time previously, been apprised of these transactions), I wrote a

<P>most obliging epistle to my unknown correspondent, and, finally,

<P>the bargain was concluded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was decreed that on the last day of January I was to enter upon

<P>my new office as governess in the family of Mr. Murray, of Horton

<P>Lodge, near O-, about seventy miles from our village:&nbsp; a formidable

<P>distance to me, as I had never been above twenty miles from home in

<P>all the course of my twenty years' sojourn on earth; and as,

<P>moreover, every individual in that family and in the neighbourhood

<P>was utterly unknown to myself and all my acquaintances.&nbsp; But this

<P>rendered it only the more piquant to me.&nbsp; I had now, in some

<P>measure, got rid of the MAUVAISE HONTE that had formerly oppressed

<P>me so much; there was a pleasing excitement in the idea of entering

<P>these unknown regions, and making my way alone among its strange

<P>inhabitants.&nbsp; I now flattered myself I was going to see something

<P>in the world:&nbsp; Mr. Murray's residence was near a large town, and

<P>not in a manufacturing district, where the people had nothing to do

<P>but to make money; his rank from what I could gather, appeared to

<P>be higher than that of Mr. Bloomfield; and, doubtless, he was one

<P>of those genuine thorough-bred gentry my mother spoke of, who would

<P>treat his governess with due consideration as a respectable well-

<P>educated lady, the instructor and guide of his children, and not a

<P>mere upper servant.&nbsp; Then, my pupils being older, would be more

<P>rational, more teachable, and less troublesome than the last; they

<P>would be less confined to the schoolroom, and not require that

<P>constant labour and incessant watching; and, finally, bright

<P>visions mingled with my hopes, with which the care of children and

<P>the mere duties of a governess had little or nothing to do.&nbsp; Thus,

<P>the reader will see that I had no claim to be regarded as a martyr

<P>to filial piety, going forth to sacrifice peace and liberty for the

<P>sole purpose of laying up stores for the comfort and support of my

<P>parents:&nbsp; though certainly the comfort of my father, and the future

<P>support of my mother, had a large share in my calculations; and

<P>fifty pounds appeared to me no ordinary sum.&nbsp; I must have decent

<P>clothes becoming my station; I must, it seemed, put out my washing,

<P>and also pay for my four annual journeys between Horton Lodge and

<P>home; but with strict attention to economy, surely twenty pounds,

<P>or little more, would cover those expenses, and then there would be

<P>thirty for the bank, or little less:&nbsp; what a valuable addition
to

<P>our stock!&nbsp; Oh, I must struggle to keep this situation, whatever
it

<P>might be! both for my own honour among my friends and for the solid

<P>services I might render them by my continuance there.
