<P>MISS MURRAY now always went twice to church, for she so loved

<P>admiration that she could not bear to lose a single opportunity of

<P>obtaining it; and she was so sure of it wherever she showed

<P>herself, that, whether Harry Meltham and Mr. Green were there or

<P>not, there was certain to be somebody present who would not be

<P>insensible to her charms, besides the Rector, whose official

<P>capacity generally obliged him to attend.&nbsp; Usually, also, if the

<P>weather permitted, both she and her sister would walk home;

<P>Matilda, because she hated the confinement of the carriage; she,

<P>because she disliked the privacy of it, and enjoyed the company

<P>that generally enlivened the first mile of the journey in walking

<P>from the church to Mr. Green's park-gates:&nbsp; near which commenced

<P>the private road to Horton Lodge, which lay in the opposite

<P>direction, while the highway conducted in a straightforward course

<P>to the still more distant mansion of Sir Hugh Meltham.&nbsp; Thus there

<P>was always a chance of being accompanied, so far, either by Harry

<P>Meltham, with or without Miss Meltham, or Mr. Green, with perhaps

<P>one or both of his sisters, and any gentlemen visitors they might

<P>have.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Whether I walked with the young ladies or rode with their parents,

<P>depended upon their own capricious will:&nbsp; if they chose to 'take'

<P>me, I went; if, for reasons best known to themselves, they chose to

<P>go alone, I took my seat in the carriage.&nbsp; I liked walking better,

<P>but a sense of reluctance to obtrude my presence on anyone who did

<P>not desire it, always kept me passive on these and similar

<P>occasions; and I never inquired into the causes of their varying

<P>whims.&nbsp; Indeed, this was the best policy - for to submit and oblige

<P>was the governess's part, to consult their own pleasure was that of

<P>the pupils.&nbsp; But when I did walk, the first half of journey was

<P>generally a great nuisance to me.&nbsp; As none of the before-mentioned

<P>ladies and gentlemen ever noticed me, it was disagreeable to walk

<P>beside them, as if listening to what they said, or wishing to be

<P>thought one of them, while they talked over me, or across; and if

<P>their eyes, in speaking, chanced to fall on me, it seemed as if

<P>they looked on vacancy - as if they either did not see me, or were

<P>very desirous to make it appear so.&nbsp; It was disagreeable, too,
to

<P>walk behind, and thus appear to acknowledge my own inferiority;

<P>for, in truth, I considered myself pretty nearly as good as the

<P>best of them, and wished them to know that I did so, and not to

<P>imagine that I looked upon myself as a mere domestic, who knew her

<P>own place too well to walk beside such fine ladies and gentlemen as

<P>they were - though her young ladies might choose to have her with

<P>them, and even condescend to converse with her when no better

<P>company were at hand.&nbsp; Thus - I am almost ashamed to confess it
-

<P>but indeed I gave myself no little trouble in my endeavours (if I

<P>did keep up with them) to appear perfectly unconscious or

<P>regardless of their presence, as if I were wholly absorbed in my

<P>own reflections, or the contemplation of surrounding objects; or,

<P>if I lingered behind, it was some bird or insect, some tree or

<P>flower, that attracted my attention, and having duly examined that,

<P>I would pursue my walk alone, at a leisurely pace, until my pupils

<P>had bidden adieu to their companions and turned off into the quiet

<P>private road.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One such occasion I particularly well remember; it was a lovely

<P>afternoon about the close of March; Mr. Green and his sisters had

<P>sent their carriage back empty, in order to enjoy the bright

<P>sunshine and balmy air in a sociable walk home along with their

<P>visitors, Captain Somebody and Lieutenant Somebody-else (a couple

<P>of military fops), and the Misses Murray, who, of course, contrived

<P>to join them.&nbsp; Such a party was highly agreeable to Rosalie; but

<P>not finding it equally suitable to my taste, I presently fell back,

<P>and began to botanise and entomologise along the green banks and

<P>budding hedges, till the company was considerably in advance of me,

<P>and I could hear the sweet song of the happy lark; then my spirit

<P>of misanthropy began to melt away beneath the soft, pure air and

<P>genial sunshine; but sad thoughts of early childhood, and yearnings

<P>for departed joys, or for a brighter future lot, arose instead.&nbsp;
As

<P>my eyes wandered over the steep banks covered with young grass and

<P>green-leaved plants, and surmounted by budding hedges, I longed

<P>intensely for some familiar flower that might recall the woody

<P>dales or green hill-sides of home:&nbsp; the brown moorlands, of course,

<P>were out of the question.&nbsp; Such a discovery would make my eyes
gush

<P>out with water, no doubt; but that was one of my greatest

<P>enjoyments now.&nbsp; At length I descried, high up between the twisted

<P>roots of an oak, three lovely primroses, peeping so sweetly from

<P>their hiding-place that the tears already started at the sight; but

<P>they grew so high above me, that I tried in vain to gather one or

<P>two, to dream over and to carry with me:&nbsp; I could not reach them

<P>unless I climbed the bank, which I was deterred from doing by

<P>hearing a footstep at that moment behind me, and was, therefore,

<P>about to turn away, when I was startled by the words, 'Allow me to

<P>gather them for you, Miss Grey,' spoken in the grave, low tones of

<P>a well-known voice.&nbsp; Immediately the flowers were gathered, and
in

<P>my hand.&nbsp; It was Mr. Weston, of course - who else would trouble

<P>himself to do so much for ME?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I thanked him; whether warmly or coldly, I cannot tell:&nbsp; but

<P>certain I am that I did not express half the gratitude I felt.&nbsp;
It

<P>was foolish, perhaps, to feel any gratitude at all; but it seemed

<P>to me, at that moment, as if this were a remarkable instance of his

<P>good-nature:&nbsp; an act of kindness, which I could not repay, but

<P>never should forget:&nbsp; so utterly unaccustomed was I to receive
such

<P>civilities, so little prepared to expect them from anyone within

<P>fifty miles of Horton Lodge.&nbsp; Yet this did not prevent me from

<P>feeling a little uncomfortable in his presence; and I proceeded to

<P>follow my pupils at a much quicker pace than before; though,

<P>perhaps, if Mr. Weston had taken the hint, and let me pass without

<P>another word, I might have repeated it an hour after:&nbsp; but he did

<P>not.&nbsp; A somewhat rapid walk for me was but an ordinary pace for

<P>him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Your young ladies have left you alone,' said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, they are occupied with more agreeable company.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then don't trouble yourself to overtake them.'&nbsp; I slackened my

<P>pace; but next moment regretted having done so:&nbsp; my companion did

<P>not speak; and I had nothing in the world to say, and feared he

<P>might be in the same predicament.&nbsp; At length, however, he broke
the

<P>pause by asking, with a certain quiet abruptness peculiar to

<P>himself, if I liked flowers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes; very much,' I answered, 'wild-flowers especially.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I like wild-flowers,' said he; 'others I don't care about, because

<P>I have no particular associations connected with them - except one

<P>or two.&nbsp; What are your favourite flowers?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Primroses, blue-bells, and heath-blossoms.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Not violets?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; because, as you say, I have no particular associations

<P>connected with them; for there are no sweet violets among the hills

<P>and valleys round my home.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It must be a great consolation to you to have a home, Miss Grey,'

<P>observed my companion after a short pause:&nbsp; 'however remote, or

<P>however seldom visited, still it is something to look to.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It is so much that I think I could not live without it,' replied

<P>I, with an enthusiasm of which I immediately repented; for I

<P>thought it must have sounded essentially silly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, yes, you could,' said he, with a thoughtful smile.&nbsp; 'The ties

<P>that bind us to life are tougher than you imagine, or than anyone

<P>can who has not felt how roughly they may be pulled without

<P>breaking.&nbsp; You might be miserable without a home, but even YOU

<P>could live; and not so miserably as you suppose.&nbsp; The human heart

<P>is like india-rubber; a little swells it, but a great deal will not

<P>burst it.&nbsp; If "little more than nothing will disturb it, little

<P>less than all things will suffice" to break it.&nbsp; As in the outer

<P>members of our frame, there is a vital power inherent in itself

<P>that strengthens it against external violence.&nbsp; Every blow that

<P>shakes it will serve to harden it against a future stroke; as

<P>constant labour thickens the skin of the hand, and strengthens its

<P>muscles instead of wasting them away:&nbsp; so that a day of arduous

<P>toil, that might excoriate a lady's palm, would make no sensible

<P>impression on that of a hardy ploughman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I speak from experience - partly my own.&nbsp; There was a time when
I

<P>thought as you do - at least, I was fully persuaded that home and

<P>its affections were the only things that made life tolerable:

<P>that, if deprived of these, existence would become a burden hard to

<P>be endured; but now I have no home - unless you would dignify my

<P>two hired rooms at Horton by such a name; - and not twelve months

<P>ago I lost the last and dearest of my early friends; and yet, not

<P>only I live, but I am not wholly destitute of hope and comfort,

<P>even for this life:&nbsp; though I must acknowledge that I can seldom

<P>enter even an humble cottage at the close of day, and see its

<P>inhabitants peaceably gathered around their cheerful hearth,

<P>without a feeling ALMOST of envy at their domestic enjoyment.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You don't know what happiness lies before you yet,' said I:&nbsp; 'you

<P>are now only in the commencement of your journey.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The best of happiness,' replied he, 'is mine already - the power

<P>and the will to be useful.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We now approached a stile communicating with a footpath that

<P>conducted to a farm-house, where, I suppose, Mr. Weston purposed to

<P>make himself 'useful;' for he presently took leave of me, crossed

<P>the stile, and traversed the path with his usual firm, elastic

<P>tread, leaving me to ponder his words as I continued my course

<P>alone.&nbsp; I had heard before that he had lost his mother not many

<P>months before he came.&nbsp; She then was the last and dearest of his

<P>early friends; and he had NO HOME.&nbsp; I pitied him from my heart:&nbsp;
I

<P>almost wept for sympathy.&nbsp; And this, I thought, accounted for the

<P>shade of premature thoughtfulness that so frequently clouded his

<P>brow, and obtained for him the reputation of a morose and sullen

<P>disposition with the charitable Miss Murray and all her kin.

<P>'But,' thought I, 'he is not so miserable as I should be under such

<P>a deprivation:&nbsp; he leads an active life; and a wide field for

<P>useful exertion lies before him.&nbsp; He can MAKE friends; and he can

<P>make a home too, if he pleases; and, doubtless, he will please some

<P>time.&nbsp; God grant the partner of that home may be worthy of his

<P>choice, and make it a happy one - such a home as he deserves to

<P>have!&nbsp; And how delightful it would be to - '&nbsp; But no matter
what I

<P>thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I began this book with the intention of concealing nothing; that

<P>those who liked might have the benefit of perusing a fellow-

<P>creature's heart:&nbsp; but we have some thoughts that all the angels
in

<P>heaven are welcome to behold, but not our brother-men - not even

<P>the best and kindest amongst them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By this time the Greens had taken themselves to their own abode,

<P>and the Murrays had turned down the private road, whither I

<P>hastened to follow them.&nbsp; I found the two girls warm in an animated

<P>discussion on the respective merits of the two young officers; but

<P>on seeing me Rosalie broke off in the middle of a sentence to

<P>exclaim, with malicious glee -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh-ho, Miss Grey! you're come at last, are you?&nbsp; No WONDER you

<P>lingered so long behind; and no WONDER you always stand up so

<P>vigorously for Mr. Weston when I abuse him.&nbsp; Ah-ha!&nbsp; I see
it all

<P>now!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, come, Miss Murray, don't be foolish,' said I, attempting a

<P>good-natured laugh; 'you know such nonsense can make no impression

<P>on me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But she still went on talking such intolerable stuff - her sister

<P>helping her with appropriate fiction coined for the occasion - that

<P>I thought it necessary to say something in my own justification.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What folly all this is!' I exclaimed.&nbsp; 'If Mr. Weston's road

<P>happened to be the same as mine for a few yards, and if he chose to

<P>exchange a word or two in passing, what is there so remarkable in

<P>that?&nbsp; I assure you, I never spoke to him before:&nbsp; except
once.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Where? where? and when?' cried they eagerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'In Nancy's cottage.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ah-ha! you've met him there, have you?' exclaimed Rosalie, with

<P>exultant laughter.&nbsp; 'Ah! now, Matilda, I've found out why she's
so

<P>fond of going to Nancy Brown's!&nbsp; She goes there to flirt with Mr.

<P>Weston.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Really, that is not worth contradicting - I only saw him there

<P>once, I tell you - and how could I know he was coming?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Irritated as I was at their foolish mirth and vexatious

<P>imputations, the uneasiness did not continue long:&nbsp; when they had

<P>had their laugh out, they returned again to the captain and

<P>lieutenant; and, while they disputed and commented upon them, my

<P>indignation rapidly cooled; the cause of it was quickly forgotten,

<P>and I turned my thoughts into a pleasanter channel.&nbsp; Thus we

<P>proceeded up the park, and entered the hall; and as I ascended the

<P>stairs to my own chamber, I had but one thought within me:&nbsp; my

<P>heart was filled to overflowing with one single earnest wish.

<P>Having entered the room, and shut the door, I fell upon my knees

<P>and offered up a fervent but not impetuous prayer:&nbsp; 'Thy will be

<P>done,' I strove to say throughout; but, 'Father, all things are

<P>possible with Thee, and may it be Thy will,' was sure to follow.

<P>That wish - that prayer - both men and women would have scorned me

<P>for - 'But, Father, THOU wilt NOT despise!' I said, and felt that

<P>it was true.&nbsp; It seemed to me that another's welfare was at least

<P>as ardently implored for as my own; nay, even THAT was the

<P>principal object of my heart's desire.&nbsp; I might have been deceiving

<P>myself; but that idea gave me confidence to ask, and power to hope

<P>I did not ask in vain.&nbsp; As for the primroses, I kept two of them
in

<P>a glass in my room until they were completely withered, and the

<P>housemaid threw them out; and the petals of the other I pressed

<P>between the leaves of my Bible - I have them still, and mean to

<P>keep them always.
