<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>I CAME down a little before eight, next morning, as I knew by the

<P>striking of a distant clock.&nbsp; There was no appearance of breakfast.

<P>I waited above an hour before it came, still vainly longing for

<P>access to the library; and, after that lonely repast was concluded,

<P>I waited again about an hour and a half in great suspense and

<P>discomfort, uncertain what to do.&nbsp; At length Lady Ashby came to
bid

<P>me good-morning.&nbsp; She informed me she had only just breakfasted,

<P>and now wanted me to take an early walk with her in the park.&nbsp;
She

<P>asked how long I had been up, and on receiving my answer, expressed

<P>the deepest regret, and again promised to show me the library.&nbsp;
I

<P>suggested she had better do so at once, and then there would be no

<P>further trouble either with remembering or forgetting.&nbsp; She

<P>complied, on condition that I would not think of reading, or

<P>bothering with the books now; for she wanted to show me the

<P>gardens, and take a walk in the park with me, before it became too

<P>hot for enjoyment; which, indeed, was nearly the case already.&nbsp;
Of

<P>course I readily assented; and we took our walk accordingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As we were strolling in the park, talking of what my companion had

<P>seen and heard during her travelling experience, a gentleman on

<P>horseback rode up and passed us.&nbsp; As he turned, in passing, and

<P>stared me full in the face, I had a good opportunity of seeing what

<P>he was like.&nbsp; He was tall, thin, and wasted, with a slight stoop
in

<P>the shoulders, a pale face, but somewhat blotchy, and disagreeably

<P>red about the eyelids, plain features, and a general appearance of

<P>languor and flatness, relieved by a sinister expression in the

<P>mouth and the dull, soulless eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I detest that man!' whispered Lady Ashby, with bitter emphasis, as

<P>he slowly trotted by.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Who is it?' I asked, unwilling to suppose that she should so speak

<P>of her husband.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Sir Thomas Ashby,' she replied, with dreary composure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And do you DETEST him, Miss Murray?' said I, for I was too much

<P>shocked to remember her name at the moment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, I do, Miss Grey, and despise him too; and if you knew him you

<P>would not blame me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you knew what he was before you married him.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; I only thought so:&nbsp; I did not half know him really.&nbsp;
I know

<P>you warned me against it, and I wish I had listened to you:&nbsp; but

<P>it's too late to regret that now.&nbsp; And besides, mamma ought to
have

<P>known better than either of us, and she never said anything against

<P>it - quite the contrary.&nbsp; And then I thought he adored me, and

<P>would let me have my own way:&nbsp; he did pretend to do so at first,

<P>but now he does not care a bit about me.&nbsp; Yet I should not care
for

<P>that:&nbsp; he might do as he pleased, if I might only be free to amuse

<P>myself and to stay in London, or have a few friends down here:&nbsp;
but

<P>HE WILL do as he pleases, and I must be a prisoner and a slave.

<P>The moment he saw I could enjoy myself without him, and that others

<P>knew my value better than himself, the selfish wretch began to

<P>accuse me of coquetry and extravagance; and to abuse Harry Meltham,

<P>whose shoes he was not worthy to clean.&nbsp; And then he must needs

<P>have me down in the country, to lead the life of a nun, lest I

<P>should dishonour him or bring him to ruin; as if he had not been

<P>ten times worse every way, with his betting-book, and his gaming-

<P>table, and his opera-girls, and his Lady This and Mrs. That - yes,

<P>and his bottles of wine, and glasses of brandy-and-water too!&nbsp;
Oh,

<P>I would give ten thousand worlds to be Mss Murray again!&nbsp; It is
TOO

<P>bad to feel life, health, and beauty wasting away, unfelt and

<P>unenjoyed, for such a brute as that!' exclaimed she, fairly

<P>bursting into tears in the bitterness of her vexation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course, I pitied her exceedingly; as well for her false idea of

<P>happiness and disregard of duty, as for the wretched partner with

<P>whom her fate was linked.&nbsp; I said what I could to comfort her,
and

<P>offered such counsels as I thought she most required:&nbsp; advising

<P>her, first, by gentle reasoning, by kindness, example, and

<P>persuasion, to try to ameliorate her husband; and then, when she

<P>had done all she could, if she still found him incorrigible, to

<P>endeavour to abstract herself from him - to wrap herself up in her

<P>own integrity, and trouble herself as little about him as possible.

<P>I exhorted her to seek consolation in doing her duty to God and

<P>man, to put her trust in Heaven, and solace herself with the care

<P>and nurture of her little daughter; assuring her she would be amply

<P>rewarded by witnessing its progress in strength and wisdom, and

<P>receiving its genuine affection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But I can't devote myself entirely to a child,' said she; 'it may

<P>die - which is not at all improbable.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, with care, many a delicate infant has become a strong man or

<P>woman.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But it may grow so intolerably like its father that I shall hate

<P>it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'That is not likely; it is a little girl, and strongly resembles

<P>its mother.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No matter; I should like it better if it were a boy - only that

<P>its father will leave it no inheritance that he can possibly

<P>squander away.&nbsp; What pleasure can I have in seeing a girl grow
up

<P>to eclipse me, and enjoy those pleasures that I am for ever

<P>debarred from?&nbsp; But supposing I could be so generous as to take

<P>delight in this, still it is ONLY a child; and I can't centre all

<P>my hopes in a child:&nbsp; that is only one degree better than devoting

<P>oneself to a dog.&nbsp; And as for all the wisdom and goodness you have

<P>been trying to instil into me - that is all very right and proper,

<P>I daresay, and if I were some twenty years older, I might fructify

<P>by it:&nbsp; but people must enjoy themselves when they are young; and

<P>if others won't let them - why, they must hate them for it!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The best way to enjoy yourself is to do what is right and hate

<P>nobody.&nbsp; The end of Religion is not to teach us how to die, but
how

<P>to live; and the earlier you become wise and good, the more of

<P>happiness you secure.&nbsp; And now, Lady Ashby, I have one more piece

<P>of advice to offer you, which is, that you will not make an enemy

<P>of your mother-in-law.&nbsp; Don't get into the way of holding her at

<P>arms' length, and regarding her with jealous distrust.&nbsp; I never
saw

<P>her, but I have heard good as well as evil respecting her; and I

<P>imagine that, though cold and haughty in her general demeanour, and

<P>even exacting in her requirements, she has strong affections for

<P>those who can reach them; and, though so blindly attached to her

<P>son, she is not without good principles, or incapable of hearing

<P>reason.&nbsp; If you would but conciliate her a little, and adopt a

<P>friendly, open manner - and even confide your grievances to her -

<P>real grievances, such as you have a right to complain of - it is my

<P>firm belief that she would, in time, become your faithful friend,

<P>and a comfort and support to you, instead of the incubus you

<P>describe her.'&nbsp; But I fear my advice had little effect upon the

<P>unfortunate young lady; and, finding I could render myself so

<P>little serviceable, my residence at Ashby Park became doubly

<P>painful.&nbsp; But still, I must stay out that day and the following

<P>one, as I had promised to do so:&nbsp; though, resisting all entreaties

<P>and inducements to prolong my visit further, I insisted upon

<P>departing the next morning; affirming that my mother would be

<P>lonely without me, and that she impatiently expected my return.

<P>Nevertheless, it was with a heavy heart that I bade adieu to poor

<P>Lady Ashby, and left her in her princely home.&nbsp; It was no slight

<P>additional proof of her unhappiness, that she should so cling to

<P>the consolation of my presence, and earnestly desire the company of

<P>one whose general tastes and ideas were so little congenial to her

<P>own - whom she had completely forgotten in her hour of prosperity,

<P>and whose presence would be rather a nuisance than a pleasure, if

<P>she could but have half her heart's desire.
