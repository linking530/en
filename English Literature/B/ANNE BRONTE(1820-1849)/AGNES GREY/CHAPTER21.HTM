<P>I LEFT Horton Lodge, and went to join my mother in our new abode at

<P>A-.&nbsp; I found her well in health, resigned in spirit, and even

<P>cheerful, though subdued and sober, in her general demeanour.&nbsp;
We

<P>had only three boarders and half a dozen day-pupils to commence

<P>with; but by due care and diligence we hoped ere long to increase

<P>the number of both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I set myself with befitting energy to discharge the duties of this

<P>new mode of life.&nbsp; I call it NEW, for there was, indeed, a

<P>considerable difference between working with my mother in a school

<P>of our own, and working as a hireling among strangers, despised and

<P>trampled upon by old and young; and for the first few weeks I was

<P>by no means unhappy.&nbsp; 'It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will

<P>it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?' - Those

<P>words still rang in my ear and rested on my heart:&nbsp; they were my

<P>secret solace and support.&nbsp; 'I shall see him again. - He will come;

<P>or he will write.'&nbsp; No promise, in fact, was too bright or too

<P>extravagant for Hope to whisper in my ear.&nbsp; I did not believe half

<P>of what she told me:&nbsp; I pretended to laugh at it all; but I was
far

<P>more credulous than I myself supposed; otherwise, why did my heart

<P>leap up when a knock was heard at the front door, and the maid, who

<P>opened it, came to tell my mother a gentleman wished to see her?

<P>and why was I out of humour for the rest of the day, because it

<P>proved to be a music-master come to offer his services to our

<P>school? and what stopped my breath for a moment, when the postman

<P>having brought a couple of letters, my mother said, 'Here, Agnes,

<P>this is for you,' and threw one of them to me? and what made the

<P>hot blood rush into my face when I saw it was directed in a

<P>gentleman's hand? and why - oh! why did that cold, sickening sense

<P>of disappointment fall upon me, when I had torn open the cover and

<P>found it was ONLY a letter from Mary, which, for some reason or

<P>other, her husband had directed for her?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Was it then come to this - that I should be DISAPPOINTED to receive

<P>a letter from my only sister:&nbsp; and because it was not written by
a

<P>comparative stranger?&nbsp; Dear Mary! and she had written it so kindly

<P>- and thinking I should be so pleased to have it! - I was not

<P>worthy to read it!&nbsp; And I believe, in my indignation against

<P>myself, I should have put it aside till I had schooled myself into

<P>a better frame of mind, and was become more deserving of the honour

<P>and privilege of its perusal:&nbsp; but there was my mother looking
on,

<P>and wishful to know what news it contained; so I read it and

<P>delivered it to her, and then went into the schoolroom to attend to

<P>the pupils:&nbsp; but amidst the cares of copies and sums - in the

<P>intervals of correcting errors here, and reproving derelictions of

<P>duty there, I was inwardly taking myself to task with far sterner

<P>severity.&nbsp; 'What a fool you must be,' said my head to my heart,
or

<P>my sterner to my softer self; - 'how could you ever dream that he

<P>would write to you?&nbsp; What grounds have you for such a hope - or

<P>that he will see you, or give himself any trouble about you - or

<P>even think of you again?'&nbsp; 'What grounds?' - and then Hope set

<P>before me that last, short interview, and repeated the words I had

<P>so faithfully treasured in my memory.&nbsp; 'Well, and what was there
in

<P>that? - Who ever hung his hopes upon so frail a twig?&nbsp; What was

<P>there in those words that any common acquaintance might not say to

<P>another?&nbsp; Of course, it was possible you might meet again:&nbsp;
he

<P>might have said so if you had been going to New Zealand; but that

<P>did not imply any INTENTION of seeing you - and then, as to the

<P>question that followed, anyone might ask that:&nbsp; and how did you

<P>answer? - Merely with a stupid, commonplace reply, such as you

<P>would have given to Master Murray, or anyone else you had been on

<P>tolerably civil terms with.'&nbsp; 'But, then,' persisted Hope, 'the

<P>tone and manner in which he spoke.'&nbsp; 'Oh, that is nonsense! he

<P>always speaks impressively; and at that moment there were the

<P>Greens and Miss Matilda Murray just before, and other people

<P>passing by, and he was obliged to stand close beside you, and to

<P>speak very low, unless he wished everybody to hear what he said,

<P>which - though it was nothing at all particular - of course, he

<P>would rather not.'&nbsp; But then, above all, that emphatic, yet gentle

<P>pressure of the hand, which seemed to say, 'TRUST me;' and many

<P>other things besides - too delightful, almost too flattering, to be

<P>repeated even to one's self.&nbsp; 'Egregious folly - too absurd to

<P>require contradiction - mere inventions of the imagination, which

<P>you ought to be ashamed of.&nbsp; If you would but consider your own

<P>unattractive exterior, your unamiable reserve, your foolish

<P>diffidence - which must make you appear cold, dull, awkward, and

<P>perhaps ill-tempered too; - if you had but rightly considered these

<P>from the beginning, you would never have harboured such

<P>presumptuous thoughts:&nbsp; and now that you have been so foolish,
pray

<P>repent and amend, and let us have no more of it!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I cannot say that I implicitly obeyed my own injunctions:&nbsp; but
such

<P>reasoning as this became more and more effective as time wore on,

<P>and nothing was seen or heard of Mr. Weston; until, at last, I gave

<P>up hoping, for even my heart acknowledged it was all in vain.&nbsp;
But

<P>still, I would think of him:&nbsp; I would cherish his image in my mind;

<P>and treasure every word, look, and gesture that my memory could

<P>retain; and brood over his excellences and his peculiarities, and,

<P>in fact, all I had seen, heard, or imagined respecting him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Agnes, this sea air and change of scene do you no good, I think:

<P>I never saw you look so wretched.&nbsp; It must be that you sit too

<P>much, and allow the cares of the schoolroom to worry you.&nbsp; You
must

<P>learn to take things easy, and to be more active and cheerful; you

<P>must take exercise whenever you can get it, and leave the most

<P>tiresome duties to me:&nbsp; they will only serve to exercise my

<P>patience, and, perhaps, try my temper a little.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So said my mother, as we sat at work one morning during the Easter

<P>holidays.&nbsp; I assured her that my employments were not at all

<P>oppressive; that I was well; or, if there was anything amiss, it

<P>would be gone as soon as the trying months of spring were over:

<P>when summer came I should be as strong and hearty as she could wish

<P>to see me:&nbsp; but inwardly her observation startled me.&nbsp; I knew
my

<P>strength was declining, my appetite had failed, and I was grown

<P>listless and desponding; - and if, indeed, he could never care for

<P>me, and I could never see him more - if I was forbidden to minister

<P>to his happiness - forbidden, for ever, to taste the joys of love,

<P>to bless, and to be blessed - then, life must be a burden, and if

<P>my heavenly Father would call me away, I should be glad to rest.

<P>But it would not do to die and leave my mother.&nbsp; Selfish, unworthy

<P>daughter, to forget her for a moment!&nbsp; Was not her happiness

<P>committed in a great measure to my charge? - and the welfare of our

<P>young pupils too?&nbsp; Should I shrink from the work that God had set

<P>before me, because it was not fitted to my taste?&nbsp; Did not He know

<P>best what I should do, and where I ought to labour? - and should I

<P>long to quit His service before I had finished my task, and expect

<P>to enter into His rest without having laboured to earn it?&nbsp; 'No;
by

<P>His help I will arise and address myself diligently to my appointed

<P>duty.&nbsp; If happiness in this world is not for me, I will endeavour

<P>to promote the welfare of those around me, and my reward shall be

<P>hereafter.'&nbsp; So said I in my heart; and from that hour I only

<P>permitted my thoughts to wander to Edward Weston - or at least to

<P>dwell upon him now and then - as a treat for rare occasions:&nbsp; and,

<P>whether it was really the approach of summer or the effect of these

<P>good resolutions, or the lapse of time, or all together,

<P>tranquillity of mind was soon restored; and bodily health and

<P>vigour began likewise, slowly, but surely, to return.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Early in June, I received a letter from Lady Ashby, late Miss

<P>Murray.&nbsp; She had written to me twice or thrice before, from the

<P>different stages of her bridal tour, always in good spirits, and

<P>professing to be very happy.&nbsp; I wondered every time that she had

<P>not forgotten me, in the midst of so much gaiety and variety of

<P>scene.&nbsp; At length, however, there was a pause; and it seemed she

<P>had forgotten me, for upwards of seven months passed away and no

<P>letter.&nbsp; Of course, I did not break my heart about THAT, though
I

<P>often wondered how she was getting on; and when this last epistle

<P>so unexpectedly arrived, I was glad enough to receive it.&nbsp; It was

<P>dated from Ashby Park, where she was come to settle down at last,

<P>having previously divided her time between the continent and the

<P>metropolis.&nbsp; She made many apologies for having neglected me so

<P>long, assured me she had not forgotten me, and had often intended

<P>to write, &amp;c. &amp;c., but had always been prevented by something.&nbsp;
She

<P>acknowledged that she had been leading a very dissipated life, and

<P>I should think her very wicked and very thoughtless; but,

<P>notwithstanding that, she thought a great deal, and, among other

<P>things, that she should vastly like to see me.&nbsp; 'We have been

<P>several days here already,' wrote she.&nbsp; 'We have not a single

<P>friend with us, and are likely to be very dull.&nbsp; You know I never

<P>had a fancy for living with my husband like two turtles in a nest,

<P>were he the most delightful creature that ever wore a coat; so do

<P>take pity upon me and come.&nbsp; I suppose your Midsummer holidays

<P>commence in June, the same as other people's; therefore you cannot

<P>plead want of time; and you must and shall come - in fact, I shall

<P>die if you don't.&nbsp; I want you to visit me as a friend, and stay
a

<P>long time.&nbsp; There is nobody with me, as I told you before, but
Sir

<P>Thomas and old Lady Ashby:&nbsp; but you needn't mind them - they'll

<P>trouble us but little with their company.&nbsp; And you shall have a

<P>room to yourself, whenever you like to retire to it, and plenty of

<P>books to read when my company is not sufficiently amusing.&nbsp; I

<P>forget whether you like babies; if you do, you may have the

<P>pleasure of seeing mine - the most charming child in the world, no

<P>doubt; and all the more so, that I am not troubled with nursing it

<P>- I was determined I wouldn't be bothered with that.

<P>Unfortunately, it is a girl, and Sir Thomas has never forgiven me:

<P>but, however, if you will only come, I promise you shall be its

<P>governess as soon as it can speak; and you shall bring it up in the

<P>way it should go, and make a better woman of it than its mamma.

<P>And you shall see my poodle, too:&nbsp; a splendid little charmer

<P>imported from Paris:&nbsp; and two fine Italian paintings of great value

<P>- I forget the artist.&nbsp; Doubtless you will be able to discover

<P>prodigious beauties in them, which you must point out to me, as I

<P>only admire by hearsay; and many elegant curiosities besides, which

<P>I purchased at Rome and elsewhere; and, finally, you shall see my

<P>new home - the splendid house and grounds I used to covet so

<P>greatly.&nbsp; Alas! how far the promise of anticipation exceeds the

<P>pleasure of possession!&nbsp; There's a fine sentiment!&nbsp; I assure
you I

<P>am become quite a grave old matron:&nbsp; pray come, if it be only to

<P>witness the wonderful change.&nbsp; Write by return of post, and tell
me

<P>when your vacation commences, and say that you will come the day

<P>after, and stay till the day before it closes - in mercy to
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yours affectionately,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'ROSALIE ASHBY.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I showed this strange epistle to my mother, and consulted her on

<P>what I ought to do.&nbsp; She advised me to go; and I went - willing

<P>enough to see Lady Ashby, and her baby, too, and to do anything I

<P>could to benefit her, by consolation or advice; for I imagined she

<P>must be unhappy, or she would not have applied to me thus - but

<P>feeling, as may readily be conceived, that, in accepting the

<P>invitation, I made a great sacrifice for her, and did violence to

<P>my feelings in many ways, instead of being delighted with the

<P>honourable distinction of being entreated by the baronet's lady to

<P>visit her as a friend.&nbsp; However, I determined my visit should be

<P>only for a few days at most; and I will not deny that I derived

<P>some consolation from the idea that, as Ashby Park was not very far

<P>from Horton, I might possibly see Mr. Weston, or, at least, hear

<P>something about him.
