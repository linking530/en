<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>THE 31st of January was a wild, tempestuous day:&nbsp; there was a

<P>strong north wind, with a continual storm of snow drifting on the

<P>ground and whirling through the air.&nbsp; My friends would have had
me

<P>delay my departure, but fearful of prejudicing my employers against

<P>me by such want of punctuality at the commencement of my

<P>undertaking, I persisted in keeping the appointment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I will not inflict upon my readers an account of my leaving home on

<P>that dark winter morning:&nbsp; the fond farewells, the long, long

<P>journey to O-, the solitary waitings in inns for coaches or trains

<P>- for there were some railways then - and, finally, the meeting at

<P>O- with Mr. Murray's servant, who had been sent with the phaeton to

<P>drive me from thence to Horton Lodge.&nbsp; I will just state that the

<P>heavy snow had thrown such impediments in the way of both horses

<P>and steam-engines, that it was dark some hours before I reached my

<P>journey's end, and that a most bewildering storm came on at last,

<P>which made the few miles' space between O- and Horton Lodge a long

<P>and formidable passage.&nbsp; I sat resigned, with the cold, sharp snow

<P>drifting through my veil and filling my lap, seeing nothing, and

<P>wondering how the unfortunate horse and driver could make their way

<P>even as well as they did; and indeed it was but a toilsome,

<P>creeping style of progression, to say the best of it.&nbsp; At length
we

<P>paused; and, at the call of the driver, someone unlatched and

<P>rolled back upon their creaking hinges what appeared to be the park

<P>gates.&nbsp; Then we proceeded along a smoother road, whence,

<P>occasionally, I perceived some huge, hoary mass gleaming through

<P>the darkness, which I took to be a portion of a snow-clad tree.

<P>After a considerable time we paused again, before the stately

<P>portico of a large house with long windows descending to the

<P>ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I rose with some difficulty from under the superincumbent

<P>snowdrift, and alighted from the carriage, expecting that a kind

<P>and hospitable reception would indemnify me for the toils and

<P>hardships of the day.&nbsp; A gentleman person in black opened the door,

<P>and admitted me into a spacious hall, lighted by an amber-coloured

<P>lamp suspended from the ceiling; he led me through this, along a

<P>passage, and opening the door of a back room, told me that was the

<P>schoolroom.&nbsp; I entered, and found two young ladies and two young

<P>gentlemen - my future pupils, I supposed.&nbsp; After a formal greeting,

<P>the elder girl, who was trifling over a piece of canvas and a

<P>basket of German wools, asked if I should like to go upstairs.&nbsp;
I

<P>replied in the affirmative, of course.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Matilda, take a candle, and show her her room,' said she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Matilda, a strapping hoyden of about fourteen, with a short

<P>frock and trousers, shrugged her shoulders and made a slight

<P>grimace, but took a candle and proceeded before me up the back

<P>stairs (a long, steep, double flight), and through a long, narrow

<P>passage, to a small but tolerably comfortable room.&nbsp; She then asked

<P>me if I would take some tea or coffee.&nbsp; I was about to answer No;

<P>but remembering that I had taken nothing since seven o'clock that

<P>morning, and feeling faint in consequence, I said I would take a

<P>cup of tea.&nbsp; Saying she would tell 'Brown,' the young lady

<P>departed; and by the time I had divested myself of my heavy, wet

<P>cloak, shawl, bonnet, &amp;c., a mincing damsel came to say the young

<P>ladies desired to know whether I would take my tea up there or in

<P>the schoolroom.&nbsp; Under the plea of fatigue I chose to take it

<P>there.&nbsp; She withdrew; and, after a while, returned again with a

<P>small tea-tray, and placed it on the chest of drawers, which served

<P>as a dressing-table.&nbsp; Having civilly thanked her, I asked at what

<P>time I should be expected to rise in the morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The young ladies and gentlemen breakfast at half-past eight,

<P>ma'am,' said she; 'they rise early; but, as they seldom do any

<P>lessons before breakfast, I should think it will do if you rise

<P>soon after seven.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I desired her to be so kind as to call me at seven, and, promising

<P>to do so, she withdrew.&nbsp; Then, having broken my long fast on a
cup

<P>of tea and a little thin bread and butter, I sat down beside the

<P>small, smouldering fire, and amused myself with a hearty fit of

<P>crying; after which, I said my prayers, and then, feeling

<P>considerably relieved, began to prepare for bed.&nbsp; Finding that
none

<P>of my luggage was brought up, I instituted a search for the bell;

<P>and failing to discover any signs of such a convenience in any

<P>corner of the room, I took my candle and ventured through the long

<P>passage, and down the steep stairs, on a voyage of discovery.

<P>Meeting a well-dressed female on the way, I told her what I wanted;

<P>but not without considerable hesitation, as I was not quite sure

<P>whether it was one of the upper servants, or Mrs. Murray herself:

<P>it happened, however, to be the lady's-maid.&nbsp; With the air of one

<P>conferring an unusual favour, she vouchsafed to undertake the

<P>sending up of my things; and when I had re-entered my room, and

<P>waited and wondered a long time (greatly fearing that she had

<P>forgotten or neglected to perform her promise, and doubting whether

<P>to keep waiting or go to bed, or go down again), my hopes, at

<P>length, were revived by the sound of voices and laughter,

<P>accompanied by the tramp of feet along the passage; and presently

<P>the luggage was brought in by a rough-looking maid and a man,

<P>neither of them very respectful in their demeanour to me.&nbsp; Having

<P>shut the door upon their retiring footsteps, and unpacked a few of

<P>my things, I betook myself to rest; gladly enough, for I was weary

<P>in body and mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was with a strange feeling of desolation, mingled with a strong

<P>sense of the novelty of my situation, and a joyless kind of

<P>curiosity concerning what was yet unknown, that I awoke the next

<P>morning; feeling like one whirled away by enchantment, and suddenly

<P>dropped from the clouds into a remote and unknown land, widely and

<P>completely isolated from all he had ever seen or known before; or

<P>like a thistle-seed borne on the wind to some strange nook of

<P>uncongenial soil, where it must lie long enough before it can take

<P>root and germinate, extracting nourishment from what appears so

<P>alien to its nature:&nbsp; if, indeed, it ever can.&nbsp; But this gives
no

<P>proper idea of my feelings at all; and no one that has not lived

<P>such a retired, stationary life as mine, can possibly imagine what

<P>they were:&nbsp; hardly even if he has known what it is to awake some

<P>morning, and find himself in Port Nelson, in New Zealand, with a

<P>world of waters between himself and all that knew him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I shall not soon forget the peculiar feeling with which I raised my

<P>blind and looked out upon the unknown world:&nbsp; a wide, white

<P>wilderness was all that met my gaze; a waste of
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Deserts tossed in snow,

<P>And heavy laden groves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I descended to the schoolroom with no remarkable eagerness to join

<P>my pupils, though not without some feeling of curiosity respecting

<P>what a further acquaintance would reveal.&nbsp; One thing, among others

<P>of more obvious importance, I determined with myself - I must begin

<P>with calling them Miss and Master.&nbsp; It seemed to me a chilling
and

<P>unnatural piece of punctilio between the children of a family and

<P>their instructor and daily companion; especially where the former

<P>were in their early childhood, as at Wellwood House; but even

<P>there, my calling the little Bloomfields by their simple names had

<P>been regarded as an offensive liberty:&nbsp; as their parents had taken

<P>care to show me, by carefully designating them MASTER and MISS

<P>Bloomfield, &amp;c., in speaking to me.&nbsp; I had been very slow to
take

<P>the hint, because the whole affair struck me as so very absurd; but

<P>now I determined to be wiser, and begin at once with as much form

<P>and ceremony as any member of the family would be likely to

<P>require:&nbsp; and, indeed, the children being so much older, there

<P>would be less difficulty; though the little words Miss and Master

<P>seemed to have a surprising effect in repressing all familiar,

<P>open-hearted kindness, and extinguishing every gleam of cordiality

<P>that might arise between us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As I cannot, like Dogberry, find it in my heart to bestow all my

<P>tediousness upon the reader, I will not go on to bore him with a

<P>minute detail of all the discoveries and proceedings of this and

<P>the following day.&nbsp; No doubt he will be amply satisfied with a

<P>slight sketch of the different members of the family, and a general

<P>view of the first year or two of my sojourn among them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To begin with the head:&nbsp; Mr. Murray was, by all accounts, a

<P>blustering, roystering, country squire:&nbsp; a devoted fox-hunter,
a

<P>skilful horse-jockey and farrier, an active, practical farmer, and

<P>a hearty BON VIVANT.&nbsp; By all accounts, I say; for, except on

<P>Sundays, when he went to church, I never saw him from month to

<P>month:&nbsp; unless, in crossing the hall or walking in the grounds,
the

<P>figure of a tall, stout gentleman, with scarlet cheeks and crimson

<P>nose, happened to come across me; on which occasions, if he passed

<P>near enough to speak, an unceremonious nod, accompanied by a

<P>'Morning, Miss Grey,' or some such brief salutation, was usually

<P>vouchsafed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently, indeed, his loud laugh reached me
from

<P>afar; and oftener still I heard him swearing and blaspheming

<P>against the footmen, groom, coachman, or some other hapless

<P>dependant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Murray was a handsome, dashing lady of forty, who certainly

<P>required neither rouge nor padding to add to her charms; and whose

<P>chief enjoyments were, or seemed to be, in giving or frequenting

<P>parties, and in dressing at the very top of the fashion.&nbsp; I did
not

<P>see her till eleven o'clock on the morning after my arrival; when

<P>she honoured me with a visit, just as my mother might step into the

<P>kitchen to see a new servant-girl:&nbsp; yet not so, either, for my

<P>mother would have seen her immediately after her arrival, and not

<P>waited till the next day; and, moreover, she would have addressed

<P>her in a more kind and friendly manner, and given her some words of

<P>comfort as well as a plain exposition of her duties; but Mrs.

<P>Murray did neither the one nor the other.&nbsp; She just stepped into

<P>the schoolroom on her return from ordering dinner in the

<P>housekeeper's room, bade me good-morning, stood for two minutes by

<P>the fire, said a few words about the weather and the 'rather rough'

<P>journey I must have had yesterday; petted her youngest child - a

<P>boy of ten - who had just been wiping his mouth and hands on her

<P>gown, after indulging in some savoury morsel from the house-

<P>keeper's store; told me what a sweet, good boy he was; and then

<P>sailed out, with a self-complacent smile upon her face:&nbsp; thinking,

<P>no doubt, that she had done quite enough for the present, and had

<P>been delightfully condescending into the bargain.&nbsp; Her children

<P>evidently held the same opinion, and I alone thought otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this she looked in upon me once or twice, during the absence

<P>of my pupils, to enlighten me concerning my duties towards them.

<P>For the girls she seemed anxious only to render them as

<P>superficially attractive and showily accomplished as they could

<P>possibly be made, without present trouble or discomfort to

<P>themselves; and I was to act accordingly - to study and strive to

<P>amuse and oblige, instruct, refine, and polish, with the least

<P>possible exertion on their part, and no exercise of authority on

<P>mine.&nbsp; With regard to the two boys, it was much the same; only

<P>instead of accomplishments, I was to get the greatest possible

<P>quantity of Latin grammar and Valpy's Delectus into their heads, in

<P>order to fit them for school - the greatest possible quantity at

<P>least WITHOUT trouble to themselves.&nbsp; John might be a 'little high-

<P>spirited,' and Charles might be a little 'nervous and tedious - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But at all events, Miss Grey,' said she, 'I hope YOU will keep

<P>your temper, and be mild and patient throughout; especially with

<P>the dear little Charles; he is so extremely nervous and

<P>susceptible, and so utterly unaccustomed to anything but the

<P>tenderest treatment.&nbsp; You will excuse my naming these things to

<P>you; for the fact is, I have hitherto found all the governesses,

<P>even the very best of them, faulty in this particular.&nbsp; They wanted

<P>that meek and quiet spirit, which St. Matthew, or some of them,

<P>says is better than the putting on of apparel - you will know the

<P>passage to which I allude, for you are a clergyman's daughter.&nbsp;
But

<P>I have no doubt you will give satisfaction in this respect as well

<P>as the rest.&nbsp; And remember, on all occasions, when any of the young

<P>people do anything improper, if persuasion and gentle remonstrance

<P>will not do, let one of the others come and tell me; for I can

<P>speak to them more plainly than it would be proper for you to do.

<P>And make them as happy as you can, Miss Grey, and I dare say you

<P>will do very well.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I observed that while Mrs. Murray was so extremely solicitous for

<P>the comfort and happiness of her children, and continually talking

<P>about it, she never once mentioned mine; though they were at home,

<P>surrounded by friends, and I an alien among strangers; and I did

<P>not yet know enough of the world, not to be considerably surprised

<P>at this anomaly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Murray, otherwise Rosalie, was about sixteen when I came, and

<P>decidedly a very pretty girl; and in two years longer, as time more

<P>completely developed her form and added grace to her carriage and

<P>deportment, she became positively beautiful; and that in no common

<P>degree.&nbsp; She was tall and slender, yet not thin; perfectly formed,

<P>exquisitely fair, though not without a brilliant, healthy bloom;

<P>her hair, which she wore in a profusion of long ringlets, was of a

<P>very light brown inclining to yellow; her eyes were pale blue, but

<P>so clear and bright that few would wish them darker; the rest of

<P>her features were small, not quite regular, and not remarkably

<P>otherwise:&nbsp; but altogether you could not hesitate to pronounce
her

<P>a very lovely girl.&nbsp; I wish I could say as much for mind and

<P>disposition as I can for her form and face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yet think not I have any dreadful disclosures to make:&nbsp; she was

<P>lively, light-hearted, and could be very agreeable, with those who

<P>did not cross her will.&nbsp; Towards me, when I first came, she was

<P>cold and haughty, then insolent and overbearing; but, on a further

<P>acquaintance, she gradually laid aside her airs, and in time became

<P>as deeply attached to me as it was possible for HER to be to one of

<P>my character and position:&nbsp; for she seldom lost sight, for above

<P>half an hour at a time, of the fact of my being a hireling and a

<P>poor curate's daughter.&nbsp; And yet, upon the whole, I believe she

<P>respected me more than she herself was aware of; because I was the

<P>only person in the house who steadily professed good principles,

<P>habitually spoke the truth, and generally endeavoured to make

<P>inclination bow to duty; and this I say, not, of course, in

<P>commendation of myself, but to show the unfortunate state of the

<P>family to which my services were, for the present, devoted.&nbsp; There

<P>was no member of it in whom I regretted this sad want of principle

<P>so much as Miss Murray herself; not only because she had taken a

<P>fancy to me, but because there was so much of what was pleasant and

<P>prepossessing in herself, that, in spite of her failings, I really

<P>liked her - when she did not rouse my indignation, or ruffle my

<P>temper by TOO great a display of her faults.&nbsp; These, however, I

<P>would fain persuade myself were rather the effect of her education

<P>than her disposition:&nbsp; she had never been perfectly taught the

<P>distinction between right and wrong; she had, like her brothers and

<P>sisters, been suffered, from infancy, to tyrannize over nurses,

<P>governesses, and servants; she had not been taught to moderate her

<P>desires, to control her temper or bridle her will, or to sacrifice

<P>her own pleasure for the good of others.&nbsp; Her temper being

<P>naturally good, she was never violent or morose, but from constant

<P>indulgence, and habitual scorn of reason, she was often testy and

<P>capricious; her mind had never been cultivated:&nbsp; her intellect,
at

<P>best, was somewhat shallow; she possessed considerable vivacity,

<P>some quickness of perception, and some talent for music and the

<P>acquisition of languages, but till fifteen she had troubled herself

<P>to acquire nothing; - then the love of display had roused her

<P>faculties, and induced her to apply herself, but only to the more

<P>showy accomplishments.&nbsp; And when I came it was the same:

<P>everything was neglected but French, German, music, singing,

<P>dancing, fancy-work, and a little drawing - such drawing as might

<P>produce the greatest show with the smallest labour, and the

<P>principal parts of which were generally done by me.&nbsp; For music
and

<P>singing, besides my occasional instructions, she had the attendance

<P>of the best master the country afforded; and in these

<P>accomplishments, as well as in dancing, she certainly attained

<P>great proficiency.&nbsp; To music, indeed, she devoted too much of her

<P>time, as, governess though I was, I frequently told her; but her

<P>mother thought that if SHE liked it, she COULD not give too much

<P>time to the acquisition of so attractive an art.&nbsp; Of fancy-work
I

<P>knew nothing but what I gathered from my pupil and my own

<P>observation; but no sooner was I initiated, than she made me useful

<P>in twenty different ways:&nbsp; all the tedious parts of her work were

<P>shifted on to my shoulders; such as stretching the frames,

<P>stitching in the canvas, sorting the wools and silks, putting in

<P>the grounds, counting the stitches, rectifying mistakes, and

<P>finishing the pieces she was tired of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At sixteen, Miss Murray was something of a romp, yet not more so

<P>than is natural and allowable for a girl of that age, but at

<P>seventeen, that propensity, like all other things, began to give

<P>way to the ruling passion, and soon was swallowed up in the all-

<P>absorbing ambition to attract and dazzle the other sex.&nbsp; But enough

<P>of her:&nbsp; now let us turn to her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Matilda Murray was a veritable hoyden, of whom little need be

<P>said.&nbsp; She was about two years and a half younger than her sister;

<P>her features were larger, her complexion much darker.&nbsp; She might

<P>possibly make a handsome woman; but she was far too big-boned and

<P>awkward ever to be called a pretty girl, and at present she cared

<P>little about it.&nbsp; Rosalie knew all her charms, and thought them

<P>even greater than they were, and valued them more highly than she

<P>ought to have done, had they been three times as great; Matilda

<P>thought she was well enough, but cared little about the matter;

<P>still less did she care about the cultivation of her mind, and the

<P>acquisition of ornamental accomplishments.&nbsp; The manner in which
she

<P>learnt her lessons and practised her music was calculated to drive

<P>any governess to despair.&nbsp; Short and easy as her tasks were, if

<P>done at all, they were slurred over, at any time and in any way;

<P>but generally at the least convenient times, and in the way least

<P>beneficial to herself, and least satisfactory to me:&nbsp; the short

<P>half-hour of practising was horribly strummed through; she,

<P>meantime, unsparingly abusing me, either for interrupting her with

<P>corrections, or for not rectifying her mistakes before they were

<P>made, or something equally unreasonable.&nbsp; Once or twice, I ventured

<P>to remonstrate with her seriously for such irrational conduct; but

<P>on each of those occasions, I received such reprehensive

<P>expostulations from her mother, as convinced me that, if I wished

<P>to keep the situation, I must even let Miss Matilda go on in her

<P>own way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When her lessons were over, however, her ill-humour was generally

<P>over too:&nbsp; while riding her spirited pony, or romping with the
dogs

<P>or her brothers and sister, but especially with her dear brother

<P>John, she was as happy as a lark.&nbsp; As an animal, Matilda was all

<P>right, full of life, vigour, and activity; as an intelligent being,

<P>she was barbarously ignorant, indocile, careless and irrational;

<P>and, consequently, very distressing to one who had the task of

<P>cultivating her understanding, reforming her manners, and aiding

<P>her to acquire those ornamental attainments which, unlike her

<P>sister, she despised as much as the rest.&nbsp; Her mother was partly

<P>aware of her deficiencies, and gave me many a lecture as to how I

<P>should try to form her tastes, and endeavour to rouse and cherish

<P>her dormant vanity; and, by insinuating, skilful flattery, to win

<P>her attention to the desired objects - which I would not do; and

<P>how I should prepare and smooth the path of learning till she could

<P>glide along it without the least exertion to herself:&nbsp; which I

<P>could not, for nothing can be taught to any purpose without some

<P>little exertion on the part of the learner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As a moral agent, Matilda was reckless, headstrong, violent, and

<P>unamenable to reason.&nbsp; One proof of the deplorable state of her

<P>mind was, that from her father's example she had learned to swear

<P>like a trooper.&nbsp; Her mother was greatly shocked at the 'unlady-like

<P>trick,' and wondered 'how she had picked it up.'&nbsp; 'But you can
soon

<P>break her of it, Miss Grey,' said she:&nbsp; 'it is only a habit; and
if

<P>you will just gently remind her every time she does so, I am sure

<P>she will soon lay it aside.'&nbsp; I not only 'gently reminded' her,
I

<P>tried to impress upon her how wrong it was, and how distressing to

<P>the ears of decent people:&nbsp; but all in vain:&nbsp; I was only answered

<P>by a careless laugh, and, 'Oh, Miss Grey, how shocked you are!&nbsp;
I'm

<P>so glad!' or, 'Well!&nbsp; I can't help it; papa shouldn't have taught

<P>me:&nbsp; I learned it all from him; and maybe a bit from the coachman.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her brother John, ALIAS Master Murray, was about eleven when I

<P>came:&nbsp; a fine, stout, healthy boy, frank and good-natured in the

<P>main, and might have been a decent lad had he been properly

<P>educated; but now he was as rough as a young bear, boisterous,

<P>unruly, unprincipled, untaught, unteachable - at least, for a

<P>governess under his mother's eye.&nbsp; His masters at school might
be

<P>able to manage him better - for to school he was sent, greatly to

<P>my relief, in the course of a year; in a state, it is true, of

<P>scandalous ignorance as to Latin, as well as the more useful though

<P>more neglected things:&nbsp; and this, doubtless, would all be laid
to

<P>the account of his education having been entrusted to an ignorant

<P>female teacher, who had presumed to take in hand what she was

<P>wholly incompetent to perform.&nbsp; I was not delivered from his

<P>brother till full twelve months after, when he also was despatched

<P>in the same state of disgraceful ignorance as the former.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Master Charles was his mother's peculiar darling.&nbsp; He was little

<P>more than a year younger than John, but much smaller, paler, and

<P>less active and robust; a pettish, cowardly, capricious, selfish

<P>little fellow, only active in doing mischief, and only clever in

<P>inventing falsehoods:&nbsp; not simply to hide his faults, but, in mere

<P>malicious wantonness, to bring odium upon others.&nbsp; In fact, Master

<P>Charles was a very great nuisance to me:&nbsp; it was a trial of

<P>patience to live with him peaceably; to watch over him was worse;

<P>and to teach him, or pretend to teach him, was inconceivable.&nbsp;
At

<P>ten years old, he could not read correctly the easiest line in the

<P>simplest book; and as, according to his mother's principle, he was

<P>to be told every word, before he had time to hesitate or examine

<P>its orthography, and never even to be informed, as a stimulant to

<P>exertion, that other boys were more forward than he, it is not

<P>surprising that he made but little progress during the two years I

<P>had charge of his education.&nbsp; His minute portions of Latin grammar,

<P>&amp;c., were to be repeated over to him, till he chose to say he knew

<P>them, and then he was to be helped to say them; if he made mistakes

<P>in his little easy sums in arithmetic, they were to be shown him at

<P>once, and the sum done for him, instead of his being left to

<P>exercise his faculties in finding them out himself; so that, of

<P>course, he took no pains to avoid mistakes, but frequently set down

<P>his figures at random, without any calculation at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I did not invariably confine myself to these rules:&nbsp; it was against

<P>my conscience to do so; but I seldom could venture to deviate from

<P>them in the slightest degree, without incurring the wrath of my

<P>little pupil, and subsequently of his mamma; to whom he would

<P>relate my transgressions maliciously exaggerated, or adorned with

<P>embellishments of his own; and often, in consequence, was I on the

<P>point of losing or resigning my situation.&nbsp; But, for their sakes
at

<P>home, I smothered my pride and suppressed my indignation, and

<P>managed to struggle on till my little tormentor was despatched to

<P>school; his father declaring that home education was 'no go; for

<P>him, it was plain; his mother spoiled him outrageously, and his

<P>governess could make no hand of him at all.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few more observations about Horton Lodge and its ongoings, and I

<P>have done with dry description for the present.&nbsp; The house was
a

<P>very respectable one; superior to Mr. Bloomfield's, both in age,

<P>size, and magnificence:&nbsp; the garden was not so tastefully laid
out;

<P>but instead of the smooth-shaven lawn, the young trees guarded by

<P>palings, the grove of upstart poplars, and the plantation of firs,

<P>there was a wide park, stocked with deer, and beautified by fine

<P>old trees.&nbsp; The surrounding country itself was pleasant, as far
as

<P>fertile fields, flourishing trees, quiet green lanes, and smiling

<P>hedges with wild-flowers scattered along their banks, could make

<P>it; but it was depressingly flat to one born and nurtured among the

<P>rugged hills of -.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We were situated nearly two miles from the village church, and,

<P>consequently, the family carriage was put in requisition every

<P>Sunday morning, and sometimes oftener.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Murray

<P>generally thought it sufficient to show themselves at church once

<P>in the course of the day; but frequently the children preferred

<P>going a second time to wandering about the grounds all the day with

<P>nothing to do.&nbsp; If some of my pupils chose to walk and take me
with

<P>them, it was well for me; for otherwise my position in the carriage

<P>was to be crushed into the corner farthest from the open window,

<P>and with my back to the horses:&nbsp; a position which invariably made

<P>me sick; and if I were not actually obliged to leave the church in

<P>the middle of the service, my devotions were disturbed with a

<P>feeling of languor and sickliness, and the tormenting fear of its

<P>becoming worse:&nbsp; and a depressing headache was generally my

<P>companion throughout the day, which would otherwise have been one

<P>of welcome rest, and holy, calm enjoyment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It's very odd, Miss Grey, that the carriage should always make you

<P>sick:&nbsp; it never makes ME,' remarked Miss Matilda,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Nor me either,' said her sister; 'but I dare say it would, if I

<P>sat where she does - such a nasty, horrid place, Miss Grey; I

<P>wonder how you can bear it!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I am obliged to bear it, since no choice is left me,' - I might

<P>have answered; but in tenderness for their feelings I only replied,

<P>- 'Oh! it is but a short way, and if I am not sick in church, I

<P>don't mind it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If I were called upon to give a description of the usual divisions

<P>and arrangements of the day, I should find it a very difficult

<P>matter.&nbsp; I had all my meals in the schoolroom with my pupils, at

<P>such times as suited their fancy:&nbsp; sometimes they would ring for

<P>dinner before it was half cooked; sometimes they would keep it

<P>waiting on the table for above an hour, and then be out of humour

<P>because the potatoes were cold, and the gravy covered with cakes of

<P>solid fat; sometimes they would have tea at four; frequently, they

<P>would storm at the servants because it was not in precisely at

<P>five; and when these orders were obeyed, by way of encouragement to

<P>punctuality, they would keep it on the table till seven or eight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their hours of study were managed in much the same way; my judgment

<P>or convenience was never once consulted.&nbsp; Sometimes Matilda and

<P>John would determine 'to get all the plaguy business over before

<P>breakfast,' and send the maid to call me up at half-past five,

<P>without any scruple or apology; sometimes, I was told to be ready

<P>precisely at six, and, having dressed in a hurry, came down to an

<P>empty room, and after waiting a long time in suspense, discovered

<P>that they had changed their minds, and were still in bed; or,

<P>perhaps, if it were a fine summer morning, Brown would come to tell

<P>me that the young ladies and gentlemen had taken a holiday, and

<P>were gone out; and then I was kept waiting for breakfast till I was

<P>almost ready to faint:&nbsp; they having fortified themselves with

<P>something before they went.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Often they would do their lessons in the open air; which I had

<P>nothing to say against:&nbsp; except that I frequently caught cold by

<P>sitting on the damp grass, or from exposure to the evening dew, or

<P>some insidious draught, which seemed to have no injurious effect on

<P>them.&nbsp; It was quite right that they should be hardy; yet, surely,

<P>they might have been taught some consideration for others who were

<P>less so.&nbsp; But I must not blame them for what was, perhaps, my own

<P>fault; for I never made any particular objections to sitting where

<P>they pleased; foolishly choosing to risk the consequences, rather

<P>than trouble them for my convenience.&nbsp; Their indecorous manner
of

<P>doing their lessons was quite as remarkable as the caprice

<P>displayed in their choice of time and place.&nbsp; While receiving my

<P>instructions, or repeating what they had learned, they would lounge

<P>upon the sofa, lie on the rug, stretch, yawn, talk to each other,

<P>or look out of the window; whereas, I could not so much as stir the

<P>fire, or pick up the handkerchief I had dropped, without being

<P>rebuked for inattention by one of my pupils, or told that 'mamma

<P>would not like me to be so careless.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The servants, seeing in what little estimation the governess was

<P>held by both parents and children, regulated their behaviour by the

<P>same standard.&nbsp; I have frequently stood up for them, at the risk
of

<P>some injury to myself, against the tyranny and injustice of their

<P>young masters and mistresses; and I always endeavoured to give them

<P>as little trouble as possible:&nbsp; but they entirely neglected my

<P>comfort, despised my requests, and slighted my directions.&nbsp; All

<P>servants, I am convinced, would not have done so; but domestics in

<P>general, being ignorant and little accustomed to reason and

<P>reflection, are too easily corrupted by the carelessness and bad

<P>example of those above them; and these, I think, were not of the

<P>best order to begin with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I sometimes felt myself degraded by the life I led, and ashamed of

<P>submitting to so many indignities; and sometimes I thought myself a

<P>fool for caring so much about them, and feared I must be sadly

<P>wanting in Christian humility, or that charity which 'suffereth

<P>long and is kind, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,

<P>beareth all things, endureth all things.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, with time and patience, matters began to be slightly

<P>ameliorated:&nbsp; slowly, it is true, and almost imperceptibly; but
I

<P>got rid of my male pupils (that was no trifling advantage), and the

<P>girls, as I intimated before concerning one of them, became a

<P>little less insolent, and began to show some symptoms of esteem.

<P>'Miss Grey was a queer creature:&nbsp; she never flattered, and did
not

<P>praise them half enough; but whenever she did speak favourably of

<P>them, or anything belonging to them, they could be quite sure her

<P>approbation was sincere.&nbsp; She was very obliging, quiet, and

<P>peaceable in the main, but there were some things that put her out

<P>of temper:&nbsp; they did not much care for that, to be sure, but still

<P>it was better to keep her in tune; as when she was in a good humour

<P>she would talk to them, and be very agreeable and amusing

<P>sometimes, in her way; which was quite different to mamma's, but

<P>still very well for a change.&nbsp; She had her own opinions on every

<P>subject, and kept steadily to them - very tiresome opinions they

<P>often were; as she was always thinking of what was right and what

<P>was wrong, and had a strange reverence for matters connected with

<P>religion, and an unaccountable liking to good people.'
