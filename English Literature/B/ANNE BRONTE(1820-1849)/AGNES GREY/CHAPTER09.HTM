<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>'NOW, Miss Grey,' exclaimed Miss Murray, immediately I entered the

<P>schoolroom, after having taken off my outdoor garments, upon

<P>returning from my four weeks' recreation, 'Now - shut the door, and

<P>sit down, and I'll tell you all about the ball.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No - damn it, no!' shouted Miss Matilda.&nbsp; 'Hold your tongue, can't

<P>ye? and let me tell her about my new mare - SUCH a splendour, Miss

<P>Grey! a fine blood mare - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Do be quiet, Matilda; and let me tell my news first.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, no, Rosalie; you'll be such a damned long time over it - she

<P>shall hear me first - I'll be hanged if she doesn't!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I'm sorry to hear, Miss Matilda, that you've not got rid of that

<P>shocking habit yet.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I can't help it:&nbsp; but I'll never say a wicked word again,
if

<P>you'll only listen to me, and tell Rosalie to hold her confounded

<P>tongue.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Rosalie remonstrated, and I thought I should have been torn in

<P>pieces between them; but Miss Matilda having the loudest voice, her

<P>sister at length gave in, and suffered her to tell her story first:

<P>so I was doomed to hear a long account of her splendid mare, its

<P>breeding and pedigree, its paces, its action, its spirit, &amp;c., and

<P>of her own amazing skill and courage in riding it; concluding with

<P>an assertion that she could clear a five-barred gate 'like

<P>winking,' that papa said she might hunt the next time the hounds

<P>met, and mamma had ordered a bright scarlet hunting-habit for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Matilda! what stories you are telling!' exclaimed her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well,' answered she, no whit abashed, 'I know I COULD clear a

<P>five-barred gate, if I tried, and papa WILL say I may hunt, and

<P>mamma WILL order the habit when I ask it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, now get along,' replied Miss Murray; 'and do, dear Matilda,

<P>try to be a little more lady-like.&nbsp; Miss Grey, I wish you would

<P>tell her not to use such shocking words; she will call her horse a

<P>mare:&nbsp; it is so inconceivably shocking! and then she uses such

<P>dreadful expressions in describing it:&nbsp; she must have learned it

<P>from the grooms.&nbsp; It nearly puts me into fits when she begins.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I learned it from papa, you ass! and his jolly friends,' said the

<P>young lady, vigorously cracking a hunting-whip, which she

<P>habitually carried in her hand.&nbsp; 'I'm as good judge of horseflesh

<P>as the best of 'm.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, now get along, you shocking girl!&nbsp; I really shall take a
fit

<P>if you go on in such a way.&nbsp; And now, Miss Grey, attend to me;
I'm

<P>going to tell you about the ball.&nbsp; You must be dying to hear about

<P>it, I know.&nbsp; Oh, SUCH a ball!&nbsp; You never saw or heard, or
read, or

<P>dreamt of anything like it in all your life.&nbsp; The decorations,
the

<P>entertainment, the supper, the music were indescribable! and then

<P>the guests!&nbsp; There were two noblemen, three baronets, and five

<P>titled ladies, and other ladies and gentlemen innumerable.&nbsp; The

<P>ladies, of course, were of no consequence to me, except to put me

<P>in a good humour with myself, by showing how ugly and awkward most

<P>of them were; and the best, mamma told me, - the most transcendent

<P>beauties among them, were nothing to me.&nbsp; As for me, Miss Grey
-

<P>I'm so SORRY you didn't see me!&nbsp; I was CHARMING - wasn't I,

<P>Matilda?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Middling.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, but I really was - at least so mamma said - and Brown and

<P>Williamson.&nbsp; Brown said she was sure no gentleman could set eyes
on

<P>me without falling in love that minute; and so I may be allowed to

<P>be a little vain.&nbsp; I know you think me a shocking, conceited,

<P>frivolous girl; but then, you know, I don't attribute it ALL to my

<P>personal attractions:&nbsp; I give some praise to the hairdresser, and

<P>some to my exquisitely lovely dress - you must see it to-morrow -

<P>white gauze over pink satin - and so SWEETLY made! and a necklace

<P>and bracelet of beautiful, large pearls!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I have no doubt you looked very charming:&nbsp; but should that delight

<P>you so very much?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, no! - not that alone:&nbsp; but, then, I was so much admired; and
I

<P>made so MANY conquests in that one night - you'd be astonished to

<P>hear - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But what good will they do you?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What good!&nbsp; Think of any woman asking that!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I should think one conquest would be enough; and too much,

<P>unless the subjugation were mutual.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, but you know I never agree with you on those points.&nbsp; Now,

<P>wait a bit, and I'll tell you my principal admirers - those who

<P>made themselves very conspicuous that night and after:&nbsp; for I've

<P>been to two parties since.&nbsp; Unfortunately the two noblemen, Lord
G-

<P>and Lord F-, were married, or I might have condescended to be

<P>particularly gracious to THEM; as it was, I did not:&nbsp; though Lord

<P>F-, who hates his wife, was evidently much struck with me.&nbsp; He

<P>asked me to dance with him twice - he is a charming dancer, by-the-

<P>by, and so am I:&nbsp; you can't think how well I did - I was astonished

<P>at myself.&nbsp; My lord was very complimentary too - rather too much
so

<P>in fact - and I thought proper to be a little haughty and

<P>repellent; but I had the pleasure of seeing his nasty, cross wife

<P>ready to perish with spite and vexation - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Miss Murray! you don't mean to say that such a thing could

<P>really give you pleasure?&nbsp; However cross or - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I know it's very wrong; - but never mind!&nbsp; I mean to be
good

<P>some time - only don't preach now, there's a good creature.&nbsp; I

<P>haven't told you half yet.&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; Oh! I was going to
tell

<P>you how many unmistakeable admirers I had:- Sir Thomas Ashby was

<P>one, - Sir Hugh Meltham and Sir Broadley Wilson are old codgers,

<P>only fit companions for papa and mamma.&nbsp; Sir Thomas is young, rich,

<P>and gay; but an ugly beast, nevertheless:&nbsp; however, mamma says
I

<P>should not mind that after a few months' acquaintance.&nbsp; Then, there

<P>was Henry Meltham, Sir Hugh's younger son; rather good-looking, and

<P>a pleasant fellow to flirt with:&nbsp; but BEING a younger son, that
is

<P>all he is good for; then there was young Mr. Green, rich enough,

<P>but of no family, and a great stupid fellow, a mere country booby!

<P>and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield:&nbsp; an HUMBLE admirer he

<P>ought to consider himself; but I fear he has forgotten to number

<P>humility among his stock of Christian virtues.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Was Mr. Hatfield at the ball?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, to he sure.&nbsp; Did you think he was too good to go?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I thought be might consider it unclerical.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'By no means.&nbsp; He did not profane his cloth by dancing; but it
was

<P>with difficulty he could refrain, poor man:&nbsp; he looked as if he

<P>were dying to ask my hand just for ONE set; and - oh! by-the-by -

<P>he's got a new curate:&nbsp; that seedy old fellow Mr. Bligh has got
his

<P>long-wished-for living at last, and is gone.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And what is the new one like?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, SUCH a beast!&nbsp; Weston his name is.&nbsp; I can give you his

<P>description in three words - an insensate, ugly, stupid blockhead.

<P>That's four, but no matter - enough of HIM now.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then she returned to the ball, and gave me a further account of her

<P>deportment there, and at the several parties she had since

<P>attended; and further particulars respecting Sir Thomas Ashby and

<P>Messrs. Meltham, Green, and Hatfield, and the ineffaceable

<P>impression she had wrought upon each of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, which of the four do you like best?' said I, suppressing my

<P>third or fourth yawn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I detest them all!' replied she, shaking her bright ringlets in

<P>vivacious scorn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'That means, I suppose, "I like them all" - but which most?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, I really detest them all; but Harry Meltham is the handsomest

<P>and most amusing, and Mr. Hatfield the cleverest, Sir Thomas the

<P>wickedest, and Mr. Green the most stupid.&nbsp; But the one I'm to have,

<P>I suppose, if I'm doomed to have any of them, is Sir Thomas Ashby.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Surely not, if he's so wicked, and if you dislike him?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, I don't mind his being wicked:&nbsp; he's all the better for that;

<P>and as for disliking him - I shouldn't greatly object to being Lady

<P>Ashby of Ashby Park, if I must marry.&nbsp; But if I could be always

<P>young, I would be always single.&nbsp; I should like to enjoy myself

<P>thoroughly, and coquet with all the world, till I am on the verge

<P>of being called an old maid; and then, to escape the infamy of

<P>that, after having made ten thousand conquests, to break all their

<P>hearts save one, by marrying some high-born, rich, indulgent

<P>husband, whom, on the other hand, fifty ladies were dying to have.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, as long as you entertain these views, keep single by all

<P>means, and never marry at all:&nbsp; not even to escape the infamy of

<P>old-maidenhood.'
