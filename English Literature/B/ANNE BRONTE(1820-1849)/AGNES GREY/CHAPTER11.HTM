<P>AS I had now only one regular pupil - though she contrived to give

<P>me as much trouble as three or four ordinary ones, and though her

<P>sister still took lessons in German and drawing - I had

<P>considerably more time at my own disposal than I had ever been

<P>blessed with before, since I had taken upon me the governess's

<P>yoke; which time I devoted partly to correspondence with my

<P>friends, partly to reading, study, and the practice of music,

<P>singing, &amp;c., partly to wandering in the grounds or adjacent

<P>fields, with my pupils if they wanted me, alone if they did not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Often, when they had no more agreeable occupation at hand, the

<P>Misses Murray would amuse themselves with visiting the poor

<P>cottagers on their father's estate, to receive their flattering

<P>homage, or to hear the old stories or gossiping news of the

<P>garrulous old women; or, perhaps, to enjoy the purer pleasure of

<P>making the poor people happy with their cheering presence and their

<P>occasional gifts, so easily bestowed, so thankfully received.

<P>Sometimes, I was called upon to accompany one or both of the

<P>sisters in these visits; and sometimes I was desired to go alone,

<P>to fulfil some promise which they had been more ready to make than

<P>to perform; to carry some small donation, or read to one who was

<P>sick or seriously disposed:&nbsp; and thus I made a few acquaintances

<P>among the cottagers; and, occasionally, I went to see them on my

<P>own account.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I generally had more satisfaction in going alone than with either

<P>of the young ladies; for they, chiefly owing to their defective

<P>education, comported themselves towards their inferiors in a manner

<P>that was highly disagreeable for me to witness.&nbsp; They never, in

<P>thought, exchanged places with them; and, consequently, had no

<P>consideration for their feelings, regarding them as an order of

<P>beings entirely different from themselves.&nbsp; They would watch the

<P>poor creatures at their meals, making uncivil remarks about their

<P>food, and their manner of eating; they would laugh at their simple

<P>notions and provincial expressions, till some of them scarcely

<P>durst venture to speak; they would call the grave elderly men and

<P>women old fools and silly old blockheads to their faces:&nbsp; and all

<P>this without meaning to offend.&nbsp; I could see that the people were

<P>often hurt and annoyed by such conduct, though their fear of the

<P>'grand ladies' prevented them from testifying any resentment; but

<P>THEY never perceived it.&nbsp; They thought that, as these cottagers

<P>were poor and untaught, they must be stupid and brutish; and as

<P>long as they, their superiors, condescended to talk to them, and to

<P>give them shillings and half-crowns, or articles of clothing, they

<P>had a right to amuse themselves, even at their expense; and the

<P>people must adore them as angels of light, condescending to

<P>minister to their necessities, and enlighten their humble

<P>dwellings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I made many and various attempts to deliver my pupils from these

<P>delusive notions without alarming their pride - which was easily

<P>offended, and not soon appeased - but with little apparent result;

<P>and I know not which was the more reprehensible of the two:

<P>Matilda was more rude and boisterous; but from Rosalie's womanly

<P>age and lady-like exterior better things were expected:&nbsp; yet she

<P>was as provokingly careless and inconsiderate as a giddy child of

<P>twelve.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One bright day in the last week of February, I was walking in the

<P>park, enjoying the threefold luxury of solitude, a book, and

<P>pleasant weather; for Miss Matilda had set out on her daily ride,

<P>and Miss Murray was gone in the carriage with her mamma to pay some

<P>morning calls.&nbsp; But it struck me that I ought to leave these

<P>selfish pleasures, and the park with its glorious canopy of bright

<P>blue sky, the west wind sounding through its yet leafless branches,

<P>the snow-wreaths still lingering in its hollows, but melting fast

<P>beneath the sun, and the graceful deer browsing on its moist

<P>herbage already assuming the freshness and verdure of spring - and

<P>go to the cottage of one Nancy Brown, a widow, whose son was at

<P>work all day in the fields, and who was afflicted with an

<P>inflammation in the eyes; which had for some time incapacitated her

<P>from reading:&nbsp; to her own great grief, for she was a woman of a

<P>serious, thoughtful turn of mind.&nbsp; I accordingly went, and found

<P>her alone, as usual, in her little, close, dark cottage, redolent

<P>of smoke and confined air, but as tidy and clean as she could make

<P>it.&nbsp; She was seated beside her little fire (consisting of a few
red

<P>cinders and a bit of stick), busily knitting, with a small

<P>sackcloth cushion at her feet, placed for the accommodation of her

<P>gentle friend the cat, who was seated thereon, with her long tail

<P>half encircling her velvet paws, and her half-closed eyes dreamily

<P>gazing on the low, crooked fender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, Nancy, how are you to-day?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why, middling, Miss, i' myseln - my eyes is no better, but I'm a

<P>deal easier i' my mind nor I have been,' replied she, rising to

<P>welcome me with a contented smile; which I was glad to see, for

<P>Nancy had been somewhat afflicted with religious melancholy.&nbsp; I

<P>congratulated her upon the change.&nbsp; She agreed that it was a great

<P>blessing, and expressed herself 'right down thankful for it';

<P>adding, 'If it please God to spare my sight, and make me so as I

<P>can read my Bible again, I think I shall be as happy as a queen.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I hope He will, Nancy,' replied I; 'and, meantime, I'll come and

<P>read to you now and then, when I have a little time to spare.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With expressions of grateful pleasure, the poor woman moved to get

<P>me a chair; but, as I saved her the trouble, she busied herself

<P>with stirring the fire, and adding a few more sticks to the

<P>decaying embers; and then, taking her well-used Bible from the

<P>shelf, dusted it carefully, and gave it me.&nbsp; On my asking if there

<P>was any particular part she should like me to read, she answered -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, Miss Grey, if it's all the same to you, I should like to

<P>hear that chapter in the First Epistle of St. John, that says, "God

<P>is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in

<P>him."'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a little searching, I found these words in the fourth chapter.

<P>When I came to the seventh verse she interrupted me, and, with

<P>needless apologies for such a liberty, desired me to read it very

<P>slowly, that she might take it all in, and dwell on every word;

<P>hoping I would excuse her, as she was but a 'simple body.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The wisest person,' I replied, 'might think over each of these

<P>verses for an hour, and be all the better for it; and I would

<P>rather read them slowly than not.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Accordingly, I finished the chapter as slowly as need be, and at

<P>the same time as impressively as I could; my auditor listened most

<P>attentively all the while, and sincerely thanked me when I had

<P>done.&nbsp; I sat still about half a minute to give her time to reflect

<P>upon it; when, somewhat to my surprise, she broke the pause by

<P>asking me how I liked Mr. Weston?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know,' I replied, a little startled by the suddenness of

<P>the question; 'I think he preaches very well.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ay, he does so; and talks well too.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Does he?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He does.&nbsp; Maybe, you haven't seen him - not to talk to him much,

<P>yet?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, I never see any one to talk to - except the young ladies of

<P>the Hall.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ah; they're nice, kind young ladies; but they can't talk as he

<P>does.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Then he comes to see you, Nancy?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He does, Miss; and I'se thankful for it.&nbsp; He comes to see all
us

<P>poor bodies a deal ofter nor Maister Bligh, or th' Rector ever did;

<P>an' it's well he does, for he's always welcome:&nbsp; we can't say as

<P>much for th' Rector - there is 'at says they're fair feared on him.

<P>When he comes into a house, they say he's sure to find summut

<P>wrong, and begin a-calling 'em as soon as he crosses th' doorstuns:

<P>but maybe he thinks it his duty like to tell 'em what's wrong.&nbsp;
And

<P>very oft he comes o' purpose to reprove folk for not coming to

<P>church, or not kneeling an' standing when other folk does, or going

<P>to the Methody chapel, or summut o' that sort:&nbsp; but I can't say
'at

<P>he ever fund much fault wi' me.&nbsp; He came to see me once or twice,

<P>afore Maister Weston come, when I was so ill troubled in my mind;

<P>and as I had only very poor health besides, I made bold to send for

<P>him - and he came right enough.&nbsp; I was sore distressed, Miss Grey
-

<P>thank God, it's owered now - but when I took my Bible, I could get

<P>no comfort of it at all.&nbsp; That very chapter 'at you've just been

<P>reading troubled me as much as aught - "He that loveth not, knoweth

<P>not God."&nbsp; It seemed fearsome to me; for I felt that I loved

<P>neither God nor man as I should do, and could not, if I tried ever

<P>so.&nbsp; And th' chapter afore, where it says, - "He that is born of

<P>God cannot commit sin."&nbsp; And another place where it says, - "Love

<P>is the fulfilling of the Law."&nbsp; And many, many others, Miss:&nbsp;
I

<P>should fair weary you out, if I was to tell them all.&nbsp; But all

<P>seemed to condemn me, and to show me 'at I was not in the right

<P>way; and as I knew not how to get into it, I sent our Bill to beg

<P>Maister Hatfield to be as kind as look in on me some day and when

<P>he came, I telled him all my troubles.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And what did he say, Nancy?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why, Miss, he seemed to scorn me.&nbsp; I might be mista'en - but he

<P>like gave a sort of a whistle, and I saw a bit of a smile on his

<P>face; and he said, "Oh, it's all stuff!&nbsp; You've been among the

<P>Methodists, my good woman."&nbsp; But I telled him I'd never been near

<P>the Methodies.&nbsp; And then he said, - "Well," says he, "you must
come

<P>to church, where you'll hear the Scriptures properly explained,

<P>instead of sitting poring over your Bible at home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But I telled him I always used coming to church when I had my

<P>health; but this very cold winter weather I hardly durst venture so

<P>far - and me so bad wi' th' rheumatic and all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But he says, "It'll do your rheumatiz good to hobble to church:

<P>there's nothing like exercise for the rheumatiz.&nbsp; You can walk

<P>about the house well enough; why can't you walk to church?&nbsp; The

<P>fact is," says he, "you're getting too fond of your ease.&nbsp; It's

<P>always easy to find excuses for shirking one's duty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But then, you know, Miss Grey, it wasn't so.&nbsp; However, I telled

<P>him I'd try.&nbsp; "But please, sir," says I, "if I do go to church,

<P>what the better shall I be?&nbsp; I want to have my sins blotted out,

<P>and to feel that they are remembered no more against me, and that

<P>the love of God is shed abroad in my heart; and if I can get no

<P>good by reading my Bible an' saying my prayers at home, what good

<P>shall I get by going to church?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"The church," says he, "is the place appointed by God for His

<P>worship.&nbsp; It's your duty to go there as often as you can.&nbsp;
If you

<P>want comfort, you must seek it in the path of duty," - an' a deal

<P>more he said, but I cannot remember all his fine words.&nbsp; However,

<P>it all came to this, that I was to come to church as oft as ever I

<P>could, and bring my prayer-book with me, an' read up all the

<P>sponsers after the clerk, an' stand, an' kneel, an' sit, an' do all

<P>as I should, and take the Lord's Supper at every opportunity, an'

<P>hearken his sermons, and Maister Bligh's, an' it 'ud be all right:

<P>if I went on doing my duty, I should get a blessing at last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"But if you get no comfort that way," says he, "it's all up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Then, sir," says I, "should you think I'm a reprobate?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Why," says he - he says, "if you do your best to get to heaven

<P>and can't manage it, you must be one of those that seek to enter in

<P>at the strait gate and shall not be able."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'An' then he asked me if I'd seen any of the ladies o' th' Hall

<P>about that mornin'; so I telled him where I had seen the young

<P>misses go on th' Moss Lane; - an' he kicked my poor cat right

<P>across th' floor, an' went after 'em as gay as a lark:&nbsp; but I was

<P>very sad.&nbsp; That last word o' his fair sunk into my heart, an' lay

<P>there like a lump o' lead, till I was weary to bear it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Howsever, I follered his advice:&nbsp; I thought he meant it all for

<P>th' best, though he HAD a queer way with him.&nbsp; But you know, Miss,

<P>he's rich an' young, and such like cannot right understand the

<P>thoughts of a poor old woman such as me.&nbsp; But, howsever, I did
my

<P>best to do all as he bade me - but maybe I'm plaguing you, Miss,

<P>wi' my chatter.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, no, Nancy!&nbsp; Go on, and tell me all.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, my rheumatiz got better - I know not whether wi' going to

<P>church or not, but one frosty Sunday I got this cold i' my eyes.

<P>Th' inflammation didn't come on all at once like, but bit by bit -

<P>but I wasn't going to tell you about my eyes, I was talking about

<P>my trouble o' mind; - and to tell the truth, Miss Grey, I don't

<P>think it was anyways eased by coming to church - nought to speak

<P>on, at least:&nbsp; I like got my health better; but that didn't mend
my

<P>soul.&nbsp; I hearkened and hearkened the ministers, and read an' read

<P>at my prayer-book; but it was all like sounding brass and a

<P>tinkling cymbal:&nbsp; the sermons I couldn't understand, an' th'

<P>prayer-book only served to show me how wicked I was, that I could

<P>read such good words an' never be no better for it, and oftens feel

<P>it a sore labour an' a heavy task beside, instead of a blessing and

<P>a privilege as all good Christians does.&nbsp; It seemed like as all

<P>were barren an' dark to me.&nbsp; And then, them dreadful words, "Many

<P>shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able."&nbsp; They like as they

<P>fair dried up my sperrit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But one Sunday, when Maister Hatfield gave out about the

<P>sacrament, I noticed where he said, "If there be any of you that

<P>cannot quiet his own conscience, but requireth further comfort or

<P>counsel, let him come to me, or some other discreet and learned

<P>minister of God's word, and open his grief!"&nbsp; So next Sunday

<P>morning, afore service, I just looked into the vestry, an' began a-

<P>talking to th' Rector again.&nbsp; I hardly could fashion to take such
a

<P>liberty, but I thought when my soul was at stake I shouldn't stick

<P>at a trifle.&nbsp; But he said he hadn't time to attend to me then.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"And, indeed," says he, "I've nothing to say to you but what I've

<P>said before.&nbsp; Take the sacrament, of course, and go on doing your

<P>duty; and if that won't serve you, nothing will.&nbsp; So don't bother

<P>me any more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'So then, I went away.&nbsp; But I heard Maister Weston - Maister Weston

<P>was there, Miss - this was his first Sunday at Horton, you know,

<P>an' he was i' th' vestry in his surplice, helping th' Rector on

<P>with his gown - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, Nancy.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And I heard him ask Maister Hatfield who I was, an' he says, "Oh,

<P>she's a canting old fool."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And I was very ill grieved, Miss Grey; but I went to my seat, and

<P>I tried to do my duty as aforetime:&nbsp; but I like got no peace.&nbsp;
An'

<P>I even took the sacrament; but I felt as though I were eating and

<P>drinking to my own damnation all th' time.&nbsp; So I went home, sorely

<P>troubled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But next day, afore I'd gotten fettled up - for indeed, Miss, I'd

<P>no heart to sweeping an' fettling, an' washing pots; so I sat me

<P>down i' th' muck - who should come in but Maister Weston!&nbsp; I

<P>started siding stuff then, an' sweeping an' doing; and I expected

<P>he'd begin a-calling me for my idle ways, as Maister Hatfield would

<P>a' done; but I was mista'en:&nbsp; he only bid me good-mornin' like,
in

<P>a quiet dacent way.&nbsp; So I dusted him a chair, an' fettled up th'

<P>fireplace a bit; but I hadn't forgotten th' Rector's words, so says

<P>I, "I wonder, sir, you should give yourself that trouble, to come

<P>so far to see a 'canting old fool,' such as me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He seemed taken aback at that; but he would fain persuade me 'at

<P>the Rector was only in jest; and when that wouldn't do, he says,

<P>"Well, Nancy, you shouldn't think so much about it:&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield

<P>was a little out of humour just then:&nbsp; you know we're none of us

<P>perfect - even Moses spoke unadvisedly with his lips.&nbsp; But now
sit

<P>down a minute, if you can spare the time, and tell me all your

<P>doubts and fears; and I'll try to remove them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'So I sat me down anent him.&nbsp; He was quite a stranger, you know,

<P>Miss Grey, and even YOUNGER nor Maister Hatfield, I believe; and I

<P>had thought him not so pleasant-looking as him, and rather a bit

<P>crossish, at first, to look at; but he spake so civil like - and

<P>when th' cat, poor thing, jumped on to his knee, he only stroked

<P>her, and gave a bit of a smile:&nbsp; so I thought that was a good sign;

<P>for once, when she did so to th' Rector, he knocked her off, like

<P>as it might be in scorn and anger, poor thing.&nbsp; But you can't

<P>expect a cat to know manners like a Christian, you know, Miss

<P>Grey.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; of course not, Nancy.&nbsp; But what did Mr. Weston say then?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He said nought; but he listened to me as steady an' patient as

<P>could be, an' never a bit o' scorn about him; so I went on, an'

<P>telled him all, just as I've telled you - an' more too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Well," says he, "Mr. Hatfield was quite right in telling you to

<P>persevere in doing your duty; but in advising you to go to church

<P>and attend to the service, and so on, he didn't mean that was the

<P>whole of a Christian's duty:&nbsp; he only thought you might there learn

<P>what more was to be done, and be led to take delight in those

<P>exercises, instead of finding them a task and a burden.&nbsp; And if
you

<P>had asked him to explain those words that trouble you so much, I

<P>think he would have told you, that if many shall seek to enter in

<P>at the strait gate and shall not be able, it is their own sins that

<P>hinder them; just as a man with a large sack on his back might wish

<P>to pass through a narrow doorway, and find it impossible to do so

<P>unless he would leave his sack behind him.&nbsp; But you, Nancy, I dare

<P>say, have no sins that you would not gladly throw aside, if you

<P>knew how?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Indeed, sir, you speak truth," said I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Well," says he, "you know the first and great commandment - and

<P>the second, which is like unto it - on which two commandments hang

<P>all the law and the prophets?&nbsp; You say you cannot love God; but
it

<P>strikes me that if you rightly consider who and what He is, you

<P>cannot help it.&nbsp; He is your father, your best friend:&nbsp; every

<P>blessing, everything good, pleasant, or useful, comes from Him; and

<P>everything evil, everything you have reason to hate, to shun, or to

<P>fear, comes from Satan - HIS enemy as well as ours.&nbsp; And for THIS

<P>cause was God manifest in the flesh, that He might destroy the

<P>works of the Devil:&nbsp; in one word, God is LOVE; and the more of
love

<P>we have within us, the nearer we are to Him and the more of His

<P>spirit we possess."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"Well, sir," I said, "if I can always think on these things, I

<P>think I might well love God:&nbsp; but how can I love my neighbours,

<P>when they vex me, and be so contrary and sinful as some on 'em is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'"It may seem a hard matter," says he, "to love our neighbours, who

<P>have so much of what is evil about them, and whose faults so often

<P>awaken the evil that lingers within ourselves; but remember that HE

<P>made them, and HE loves them; and whosoever loveth him that begat,

<P>loveth him that is begotten also.&nbsp; And if God so loveth us, that
He

<P>gave His only begotten Son to die for us, we ought also to love one

<P>another.&nbsp; But if you cannot feel positive affection for those who

<P>do not care for you, you can at least try to do to them as you

<P>would they should do unto you:&nbsp; you can endeavour to pity their

<P>failings and excuse their offences, and to do all the good you can

<P>to those about you.&nbsp; And if you accustom yourself to this, Nancy,

<P>the very effort itself will make you love them in some degree - to

<P>say nothing of the goodwill your kindness would beget in them,

<P>though they might have little else that is good about them.&nbsp; If
we

<P>love God and wish to serve Him, let us try to be like Him, to do

<P>His work, to labour for His glory - which is the good of man - to

<P>hasten the coming of His kingdom, which is the peace and happiness

<P>of all the world:&nbsp; however powerless we may seem to be, in doing

<P>all the good we can through life, the humblest of us may do much

<P>towards it:&nbsp; and let us dwell in love, that He may dwell in us
and

<P>we in Him.&nbsp; The more happiness we bestow, the more we shall

<P>receive, even here; and the greater will be our reward in heaven

<P>when we rest from our labours."&nbsp; I believe, Miss, them is his very

<P>words, for I've thought 'em ower many a time.&nbsp; An' then he took

<P>that Bible, an' read bits here and there, an' explained 'em as

<P>clear as the day:&nbsp; and it seemed like as a new light broke in on
my

<P>soul; an' I felt fair aglow about my heart, an' only wished poor

<P>Bill an' all the world could ha' been there, an' heard it all, and

<P>rejoiced wi' me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'After he was gone, Hannah Rogers, one o' th' neighbours, came in

<P>and wanted me to help her to wash.&nbsp; I telled her I couldn't just

<P>then, for I hadn't set on th' potaties for th' dinner, nor washed

<P>up th' breakfast stuff yet.&nbsp; So then she began a-calling me for
my

<P>nasty idle ways.&nbsp; I was a little bit vexed at first, but I never

<P>said nothing wrong to her:&nbsp; I only telled her like all in a quiet

<P>way, 'at I'd had th' new parson to see me; but I'd get done as

<P>quick as ever I could, an' then come an' help her.&nbsp; So then she

<P>softened down; and my heart like as it warmed towards her, an' in a

<P>bit we was very good friends.&nbsp; An' so it is, Miss Grey, "a soft

<P>answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger."&nbsp;
It

<P>isn't only in them you speak to, but in yourself.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Very true, Nancy, if we could always remember it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ay, if we could!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And did Mr. Weston ever come to see you again?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, many a time; and since my eyes has been so bad, he's sat an'

<P>read to me by the half-hour together:&nbsp; but you know, Miss, he has

<P>other folks to see, and other things to do - God bless him!&nbsp; An'

<P>that next Sunday he preached SUCH a sermon!&nbsp; His text was, "Come

<P>unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you

<P>rest," and them two blessed verses that follows.&nbsp; You wasn't there,

<P>Miss, you was with your friends then - but it made me SO happy!

<P>And I AM happy now, thank God! an' I take a pleasure, now, in doing

<P>little bits o' jobs for my neighbours - such as a poor old body

<P>'at's half blind can do; and they take it kindly of me, just as he

<P>said.&nbsp; You see, Miss, I'm knitting a pair o' stockings now; -

<P>they're for Thomas Jackson:&nbsp; he's a queerish old body, an' we've

<P>had many a bout at threaping, one anent t'other; an' at times we've

<P>differed sorely.&nbsp; So I thought I couldn't do better nor knit him
a

<P>pair o' warm stockings; an' I've felt to like him a deal better,

<P>poor old man, sin' I began.&nbsp; It's turned out just as Maister Weston

<P>said.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I'm very glad to see you so happy, Nancy, and so wise:&nbsp;
but

<P>I must go now; I shall be wanted at the Hall,' said I; and bidding

<P>her good-bye, I departed, promising to come again when I had time,

<P>and feeling nearly as happy as herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At another time I went to read to a poor labourer who was in the

<P>last stage of consumption.&nbsp; The young ladies had been to see him,

<P>and somehow a promise of reading had been extracted from them; but

<P>it was too much trouble, so they begged me to do it instead.&nbsp; I

<P>went, willingly enough; and there too I was gratified with the

<P>praises of Mr. Weston, both from the sick man and his wife.&nbsp; The

<P>former told me that he derived great comfort and benefit from the

<P>visits of the new parson, who frequently came to see him, and was

<P>'another guess sort of man' to Mr. Hatfield; who, before the

<P>other's arrival at Horton, had now and then paid him a visit; on

<P>which occasions he would always insist upon having the cottage-door

<P>kept open, to admit the fresh air for his own convenience, without

<P>considering how it might injure the sufferer; and having opened his

<P>prayer-book and hastily read over a part of the Service for the

<P>Sick, would hurry away again:&nbsp; if he did not stay to administer

<P>some harsh rebuke to the afflicted wife, or to make some

<P>thoughtless, not to say heartless, observation, rather calculated

<P>to increase than diminish the troubles of the suffering pair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Whereas,' said the man, 'Maister Weston 'ull pray with me quite in

<P>a different fashion, an' talk to me as kind as owt; an' oft read to

<P>me too, an' sit beside me just like a brother.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Just for all the world!' exclaimed his wife; 'an' about a three

<P>wik sin', when he seed how poor Jem shivered wi' cold, an' what

<P>pitiful fires we kept, he axed if wer stock of coals was nearly

<P>done.&nbsp; I telled him it was, an' we was ill set to get more:&nbsp;
but

<P>you know, mum, I didn't think o' him helping us; but, howsever, he

<P>sent us a sack o' coals next day; an' we've had good fires ever

<P>sin':&nbsp; and a great blessing it is, this winter time.&nbsp; But
that's

<P>his way, Miss Grey:&nbsp; when he comes into a poor body's house a-

<P>seein' sick folk, he like notices what they most stand i' need on;

<P>an' if he thinks they can't readily get it therseln, he never says

<P>nowt about it, but just gets it for 'em.&nbsp; An' it isn't everybody

<P>'at 'ud do that, 'at has as little as he has:&nbsp; for you know, mum,

<P>he's nowt at all to live on but what he gets fra' th' Rector, an'

<P>that's little enough they say.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I remembered then, with a species of exultation, that he had

<P>frequently been styled a vulgar brute by the amiable Miss Murray,

<P>because he wore a silver watch, and clothes not quite so bright and

<P>fresh as Mr. Hatfield's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In returning to the Lodge I felt very happy, and thanked God that I

<P>had now something to think about; something to dwell on as a relief

<P>from the weary monotony, the lonely drudgery, of my present life:

<P>for I WAS lonely.&nbsp; Never, from month to month, from year to year,

<P>except during my brief intervals of rest at home, did I see one

<P>creature to whom I could open my heart, or freely speak my thoughts

<P>with any hope of sympathy, or even comprehension:&nbsp; never one,

<P>unless it were poor Nancy Brown, with whom I could enjoy a single

<P>moment of real social intercourse, or whose conversation was

<P>calculated to render me better, wiser, or happier than before; or

<P>who, as far as I could see, could be greatly benefited by mine.&nbsp;
My

<P>only companions had been unamiable children, and ignorant, wrong-

<P>headed girls; from whose fatiguing folly, unbroken solitude was

<P>often a relief most earnestly desired and dearly prized.&nbsp; But to
be

<P>restricted to such associates was a serious evil, both in its

<P>immediate effects and the consequences that were likely to ensue.

<P>Never a new idea or stirring thought came to me from without; and

<P>such as rose within me were, for the most part, miserably crushed

<P>at once, or doomed to sicken or fade away, because they could not

<P>see the light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Habitual associates are known to exercise a great influence over

<P>each other's minds and manners.&nbsp; Those whose actions are for ever

<P>before our eyes, whose words are ever in our ears, will naturally

<P>lead us, albeit against our will, slowly, gradually, imperceptibly,

<P>perhaps, to act and speak as they do.&nbsp; I will not presume to say

<P>how far this irresistible power of assimilation extends; but if one

<P>civilised man were doomed to pass a dozen years amid a race of

<P>intractable savages, unless he had power to improve them, I greatly

<P>question whether, at the close of that period, he would not have

<P>become, at least, a barbarian himself.&nbsp; And I, as I could not make

<P>my young companions better, feared exceedingly that they would make

<P>me worse - would gradually bring my feelings, habits, capacities,

<P>to the level of their own; without, however, imparting to me their

<P>lightheartedness and cheerful vivacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Already, I seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating, my heart

<P>petrifying, my soul contracting; and I trembled lest my very moral

<P>perceptions should become deadened, my distinctions of right and

<P>wrong confounded, and all my better faculties be sunk, at last,

<P>beneath the baneful influence of such a mode of life.&nbsp; The gross

<P>vapours of earth were gathering around me, and closing in upon my

<P>inward heaven; and thus it was that Mr. Weston rose at length upon

<P>me, appearing like the morning star in my horizon, to save me from

<P>the fear of utter darkness; and I rejoiced that I had now a subject

<P>for contemplation that was above me, not beneath.&nbsp; I was glad to

<P>see that all the world was not made up of Bloomfields, Murrays,

<P>Hatfields, Ashbys, &amp;c.; and that human excellence was not a mere

<P>dream of the imagination.&nbsp; When we hear a little good and no harm

<P>of a person, it is easy and pleasant to imagine more:&nbsp; in short,
it

<P>is needless to analyse all my thoughts; but Sunday was now become a

<P>day of peculiar delight to me (I was now almost broken-in to the

<P>back corner in the carriage), for I liked to hear him - and I liked

<P>to see him, too; though I knew he was not handsome, or even what is

<P>called agreeable, in outward aspect; but, certainly, he was not

<P>ugly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In stature he was a little, a very little, above the middle size;

<P>the outline of his face would be pronounced too square for beauty,

<P>but to me it announced decision of character; his dark brown hair

<P>was not carefully curled, like Mr. Hatfield's, but simply brushed

<P>aside over a broad white forehead; the eyebrows, I suppose, were

<P>too projecting, but from under those dark brows there gleamed an

<P>eye of singular power, brown in colour, not large, and somewhat

<P>deep-set, but strikingly brilliant, and full of expression; there

<P>was character, too, in the mouth, something that bespoke a man of

<P>firm purpose and an habitual thinker; and when he smiled - but I

<P>will not speak of that yet, for, at the time I mention, I had never

<P>seen him smile:&nbsp; and, indeed, his general appearance did not

<P>impress me with the idea of a man given to such a relaxation, nor

<P>of such an individual as the cottagers described him.&nbsp; I had early

<P>formed my opinion of him; and, in spite of Miss Murray's

<P>objurgations:&nbsp; was fully convinced that he was a man of strong

<P>sense, firm faith, and ardent piety, but thoughtful and stern:&nbsp;
and

<P>when I found that, to his other good qualities, was added that of

<P>true benevolence and gentle, considerate kindness, the discovery,

<P>perhaps, delighted me the more, as I had not been prepared to

<P>expect it.
