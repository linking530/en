<P>NEXT Sunday was one of the gloomiest of April days - a day of

<P>thick, dark clouds, and heavy showers.&nbsp; None of the Murrays were

<P>disposed to attend church in the afternoon, excepting Rosalie:&nbsp;
she

<P>was bent upon going as usual; so she ordered the carriage, and I

<P>went with her:&nbsp; nothing loth, of course, for at church I might
look

<P>without fear of scorn or censure upon a form and face more pleasing

<P>to me than the most beautiful of God's creations; I might listen

<P>without disturbance to a voice more charming than the sweetest

<P>music to my ears; I might seem to hold communion with that soul in

<P>which I felt so deeply interested, and imbibe its purest thoughts

<P>and holiest aspirations, with no alloy to such felicity except the

<P>secret reproaches of my conscience, which would too often whisper

<P>that I was deceiving my own self, and mocking God with the service

<P>of a heart more bent upon the creature than the Creator.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sometimes, such thoughts would give me trouble enough; but

<P>sometimes I could quiet them with thinking - it is not the man, it

<P>is his goodness that I love.&nbsp; 'Whatsoever things are pure,

<P>whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are honest and of

<P>good report, think on these things.'&nbsp; We do well to worship God
in

<P>His works; and I know none of them in which so many of His

<P>attributes - so much of His own spirit shines, as in this His

<P>faithful servant; whom to know and not to appreciate, were obtuse

<P>insensibility in me, who have so little else to occupy my heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almost immediately after the conclusion of the service, Miss Murray

<P>left the church.&nbsp; We had to stand in the porch, for it was raining,

<P>and the carriage was not yet come.&nbsp; I wondered at her coming forth

<P>so hastily, for neither young Meltham nor Squire Green was there;

<P>but I soon found it was to secure an interview with Mr. Weston as

<P>he came out, which he presently did.&nbsp; Having saluted us both, he

<P>would have passed on, but she detained him; first with observations

<P>upon the disagreeable weather, and then with asking if he would be

<P>so kind as to come some time to-morrow to see the granddaughter of

<P>the old woman who kept the porter's lodge, for the girl was ill of

<P>a fever, and wished to see him.&nbsp; He promised to do so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And at what time will you be most likely to come, Mr. Weston?&nbsp;
The

<P>old woman will like to know when to expect you - you know such

<P>people think more about having their cottages in order when decent

<P>people come to see them than we are apt to suppose.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was a wonderful instance of consideration from the thoughtless

<P>Miss Murray.&nbsp; Mr. Weston named an hour in the morning at which
he

<P>would endeavour, to be there.&nbsp; By this time the carriage was ready,

<P>and the footman was waiting, with an open umbrella, to escort Miss

<P>Murray through the churchyard.&nbsp; I was about to follow; but Mr.

<P>Weston had an umbrella too, and offered me the benefit of its

<P>shelter, for it was raining heavily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, thank you, I don't mind the rain,' I said.&nbsp; I always lacked

<P>common sense when taken by surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you don't LIKE it, I suppose? - an umbrella will do you no

<P>harm at any rate,' he replied, with a smile that showed he was not

<P>offended; as a man of worse temper or less penetration would have

<P>been at such a refusal of his aid.&nbsp; I could not deny the truth
of

<P>his assertion, and so went with him to the carriage; he even

<P>offered me his hand on getting in:&nbsp; an unnecessary piece of

<P>civility, but I accepted that too, for fear of giving offence.&nbsp;
One

<P>glance he gave, one little smile at parting - it was but for a

<P>moment; but therein I read, or thought I read, a meaning that

<P>kindled in my heart a brighter flame of hope than had ever yet

<P>arisen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I would have sent the footman back for you, Miss Grey, if you'd

<P>waited a moment - you needn't have taken Mr. Weston's umbrella,'

<P>observed Rosalie, with a very unamiable cloud upon her pretty face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I would have come without an umbrella, but Mr. Weston offered me

<P>the benefit of his, and I could not have refused it more than I did

<P>without offending him,' replied I, smiling placidly; for my inward

<P>happiness made that amusing, which would have wounded me at another

<P>time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The carriage was now in motion.&nbsp; Miss Murray bent forwards, and

<P>looked out of the window as we were passing Mr. Weston.&nbsp; He was

<P>pacing homewards along the causeway, and did not turn his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Stupid ass!' cried she, throwing herself back again in the seat.

<P>'You don't know what you've lost by not looking this way!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What has he lost?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'A bow from me, that would have raised him to the seventh heaven!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I made no answer.&nbsp; I saw she was out of humour, and I derived a

<P>secret gratification from the fact, not that she was vexed, but

<P>that she thought she had reason to be so.&nbsp; It made me think my

<P>hopes were not entirely the offspring of my wishes and imagination.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I mean to take up Mr. Weston instead of Mr. Hatfield,' said my

<P>companion, after a short pause, resuming something of her usual

<P>cheerfulness.&nbsp; 'The ball at Ashby Park takes place on Tuesday,
you

<P>know; and mamma thinks it very likely that Sir Thomas will propose

<P>to me then:&nbsp; such things are often done in the privacy of the ball-

<P>room, when gentlemen are most easily ensnared, and ladies most

<P>enchanting.&nbsp; But if I am to be married so soon, I must make the

<P>best of the present time:&nbsp; I am determined Hatfield shall not be

<P>the only man who shall lay his heart at my feet, and implore me to

<P>accept the worthless gift in vain.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'If you mean Mr. Weston to be one of your victims,' said I, with

<P>affected indifference, 'you will have to make such overtures

<P>yourself that you will find it difficult to draw back when he asks

<P>you to fulfil the expectations you have raised.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't suppose he will ask me to marry him, nor should I desire

<P>it:&nbsp; that would be rather too much presumption! but I intend him
to

<P>feel my power.&nbsp; He has felt it already, indeed:&nbsp; but he shall

<P>ACKNOWLEDGE it too; and what visionary hopes he may have, he must

<P>keep to himself, and only amuse me with the result of them - for a

<P>time.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh! that some kind spirit would whisper those words in his ear,' I

<P>inwardly exclaimed.&nbsp; I was far too indignant to hazard a reply
to

<P>her observation aloud; and nothing more was said about Mr. Weston

<P>that day, by me or in my hearing.&nbsp; But next morning, soon after

<P>breakfast, Miss Murray came into the schoolroom, where her sister

<P>was employed at her studies, or rather her lessons, for studies

<P>they were not, and said, 'Matilda, I want you to take a walk with

<P>me about eleven o'clock.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, I can't, Rosalie!&nbsp; I have to give orders about my new bridle

<P>and saddle-cloth, and speak to the rat-catcher about his dogs:

<P>Miss Grey must go with you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, I want you,' said Rosalie; and calling her sister to the

<P>window, she whispered an explanation in her ear; upon which the

<P>latter consented to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I remembered that eleven was the hour at which Mr. Weston proposed

<P>to come to the porter's lodge; and remembering that, I beheld the

<P>whole contrivance.&nbsp; Accordingly, at dinner, I was entertained with

<P>a long account of how Mr. Weston had overtaken them as they were

<P>walking along the road; and how they had had a long walk and talk

<P>with him, and really found him quite an agreeable companion; and

<P>how he must have been, and evidently was, delighted with them and

<P>their amazing condescension, &amp;c. &amp;c.
