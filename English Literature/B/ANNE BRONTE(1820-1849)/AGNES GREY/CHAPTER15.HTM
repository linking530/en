<P>'OH, dear!&nbsp; I wish Hatfield had not been so precipitate!' said

<P>Rosalie next day at four P.M., as, with a portentous yawn, she laid

<P>down her worsted-work and looked listlessly towards the window.

<P>'There's no inducement to go out now; and nothing to look forward

<P>to.&nbsp; The days will be so long and dull when there are no parties
to

<P>enliven them; and there are none this week, or next either, that I

<P>know of.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Pity you were so cross to him,' observed Matilda, to whom this

<P>lamentation was addressed.&nbsp; 'He'll never come again:&nbsp; and
I suspect

<P>you liked him after all.&nbsp; I hoped you would have taken him for
your

<P>beau, and left dear Harry to me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Humph! my beau must be an Adonis indeed, Matilda, the admired of

<P>all beholders, if I am to be contented with him alone.&nbsp; I'm sorry

<P>to lose Hatfield, I confess; but the first decent man, or number of

<P>men, that come to supply his place, will be more than welcome.

<P>It's Sunday to-morrow - I do wonder how he'll look, and whether

<P>he'll be able to go through the service.&nbsp; Most likely he'll pretend

<P>he's got a cold, and make Mr. Weston do it all.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Not he!' exclaimed Matilda, somewhat contemptuously.&nbsp; 'Fool as
he

<P>is, he's not so soft as that comes to.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her sister was slightly offended; but the event proved Matilda was

<P>right:&nbsp; the disappointed lover performed his pastoral duties as

<P>usual.&nbsp; Rosalie, indeed, affirmed he looked very pale and dejected:

<P>he might be a little paler; but the difference, if any, was

<P>scarcely perceptible.&nbsp; As for his dejection, I certainly did not

<P>hear his laugh ringing from the vestry as usual, nor his voice loud

<P>in hilarious discourse; though I did hear it uplifted in rating the

<P>sexton in a manner that made the congregation stare; and, in his

<P>transits to and from the pulpit and the communion-table, there was

<P>more of solemn pomp, and less of that irreverent, self-confident,

<P>or rather self-delighted imperiousness with which he usually swept

<P>along - that air that seemed to say, 'You all reverence and adore

<P>me, I know; but if anyone does not, I defy him to the teeth!'&nbsp;
But

<P>the most remarkable change was, that he never once suffered his

<P>eyes to wander in the direction of Mr. Murray's pew, and did not

<P>leave the church till we were gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Hatfield had doubtless received a very severe blow; but his

<P>pride impelled him to use every effort to conceal the effects of

<P>it.&nbsp; He had been disappointed in his certain hope of obtaining
not

<P>only a beautiful, and, to him, highly attractive wife, but one

<P>whose rank and fortune might give brilliance to far inferior

<P>charms:&nbsp; he was likewise, no doubt, intensely mortified by his

<P>repulse, and deeply offended at the conduct of Miss Murray

<P>throughout.&nbsp; It would have given him no little consolation to have

<P>known how disappointed she was to find him apparently so little

<P>moved, and to see that he was able to refrain from casting a single

<P>glance at her throughout both services; though, she declared, it

<P>showed he was thinking of her all the time, or his eyes would have

<P>fallen upon her, if it were only by chance:&nbsp; but if they had so

<P>chanced to fall, she would have affirmed it was because they could

<P>not resist the attraction.&nbsp; It might have pleased him, too, in
some

<P>degree, to have seen how dull and dissatisfied she was throughout

<P>that week (the greater part of it, at least), for lack of her usual

<P>source of excitement; and how often she regretted having 'used him

<P>up so soon,' like a child that, having devoured its plumcake too

<P>hastily, sits sucking its fingers, and vainly lamenting its

<P>greediness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At length I was called upon, one fine morning, to accompany her in

<P>a walk to the village.&nbsp; Ostensibly she went to get some shades
of

<P>Berlin wool, at a tolerably respectable shop that was chiefly

<P>supported by the ladies of the vicinity:&nbsp; really - I trust there
is

<P>no breach of charity in supposing that she went with the idea of

<P>meeting either with the Rector himself, or some other admirer by

<P>the way; for as we went along, she kept wondering 'what Hatfield

<P>would do or say, if we met him,' &amp;c. &amp;c.; as we passed Mr. Green's

<P>park-gates, she 'wondered whether he was at home - great stupid

<P>blockhead'; as Lady Meltham's carriage passed us, she 'wondered

<P>what Mr. Harry was doing this fine day'; and then began to abuse

<P>his elder brother for being 'such a fool as to get married and go

<P>and live in London.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why,' said I, 'I thought you wanted to live in London yourself.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, because it's so dull here:&nbsp; but then he makes it still duller

<P>by taking himself off:&nbsp; and if he were not married I might have
him

<P>instead of that odious Sir Thomas.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, observing the prints of a horse's feet on the somewhat miry

<P>road, she 'wondered whether it was a gentleman's horse,' and

<P>finally concluded it was, for the impressions were too small to

<P>have been made by a 'great clumsy cart-horse'; and then she

<P>'wondered who the rider could be,' and whether we should meet him

<P>coming back, for she was sure he had only passed that morning; and

<P>lastly, when we entered the village and saw only a few of its

<P>humble inhabitants moving about, she 'wondered why the stupid

<P>people couldn't keep in their houses; she was sure she didn't want

<P>to see their ugly faces, and dirty, vulgar clothes - it wasn't for

<P>that she came to Horton!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amid all this, I confess, I wondered, too, in secret, whether we

<P>should meet, or catch a glimpse of somebody else; and as we passed

<P>his lodgings, I even went so far as to wonder whether he was at the

<P>window.&nbsp; On entering the shop, Miss Murray desired me to stand
in

<P>the doorway while she transacted her business, and tell her if

<P>anyone passed.&nbsp; But alas! there was no one visible besides the

<P>villagers, except Jane and Susan Green coming down the single

<P>street, apparently returning from a walk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Stupid things!' muttered she, as she came out after having

<P>concluded her bargain.&nbsp; 'Why couldn't they have their dolt of a

<P>brother with them? even he would be better than nothing.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She greeted them, however, with a cheerful smile, and protestations

<P>of pleasure at the happy meeting equal to their own.&nbsp; They placed

<P>themselves one on each side of her, and all three walked away

<P>chatting and laughing as young ladies do when they get together, if

<P>they be but on tolerably intimate terms.&nbsp; But I, feeling myself
to

<P>be one too many, left them to their merriment and lagged behind, as

<P>usual on such occasions:&nbsp; I had no relish for walking beside Miss

<P>Green or Miss Susan like one deaf and dumb, who could neither speak

<P>nor be spoken to.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this time I was not long alone.&nbsp; It struck me, first, as very

<P>odd, that just as I was thinking about Mr. Weston he should come up

<P>and accost me; but afterwards, on due reflection, I thought there

<P>was nothing odd about it, unless it were the fact of his speaking

<P>to me; for on such a morning and so near his own abode, it was

<P>natural enough that he should be about; and as for my thinking of

<P>him, I had been doing that, with little intermission, ever since we

<P>set out on our journey; so there was nothing remarkable in that.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You are alone again, Miss Grey,' said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What kind of people are those ladies - the Misses Green?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I really don't know.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'That's strange - when you live so near and see them so often!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I suppose they are lively, good-tempered girls; but I

<P>imagine you must know them better than I do, yourself, for I never

<P>exchanged a word with either of them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Indeed?&nbsp; They don't strike me as being particularly reserved.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Very likely they are not so to people of their own class; but they

<P>consider themselves as moving in quite a different sphere from me!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made no reply to this:&nbsp; but after a short pause, he said, -
'I

<P>suppose it's these things, Miss Grey, that make you think you could

<P>not live without a home?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Not exactly.&nbsp; The fact is I am too socially disposed to be able
to

<P>live contentedly without a friend; and as the only friends I have,

<P>or am likely to have, are at home, if it - or rather, if they were

<P>gone - I will not say I could not live - but I would rather not

<P>live in such a desolate world.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But why do you say the only friends you are likely to have?&nbsp; Are

<P>you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, but I never made one yet; and in my present position there is

<P>no possibility of doing so, or even of forming a common

<P>acquaintance.&nbsp; The fault may be partly in myself, but I hope not

<P>altogether.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The fault is partly in society, and partly, I should think, in

<P>your immediate neighbours:&nbsp; and partly, too, in yourself; for many

<P>ladies, in your position, would make themselves be noticed and

<P>accounted of.&nbsp; But your pupils should be companions for you in
some

<P>degree; they cannot be many years younger than yourself.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, yes, they are good company sometimes; but I cannot call them

<P>friends, nor would they think of bestowing such a name on me - they

<P>have other companions better suited to their tastes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Perhaps you are too wise for them.&nbsp; How do you amuse yourself
when

<P>alone - do you read much?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Reading is my favourite occupation, when I have leisure for it and

<P>books to read.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From speaking of books in general, he passed to different books in

<P>particular, and proceeded by rapid transitions from topic to topic,

<P>till several matters, both of taste and opinion, had been discussed

<P>considerably within the space of half an hour, but without the

<P>embellishment of many observations from himself; he being evidently

<P>less bent upon communicating his own thoughts and predilections,

<P>than on discovering mine.&nbsp; He had not the tact, or the art, to

<P>effect such a purpose by skilfully drawing out my sentiments or

<P>ideas through the real or apparent statement of his own, or leading

<P>the conversation by imperceptible gradations to such topics as he

<P>wished to advert to:&nbsp; but such gentle abruptness, and such single-

<P>minded straightforwardness, could not possibly offend me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And why should he interest himself at all in my moral and

<P>intellectual capacities:&nbsp; what is it to him what I think or feel?'

<P>I asked myself.&nbsp; And my heart throbbed in answer to the question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Jane and Susan Green soon reached their home.&nbsp; As they stood

<P>parleying at the park-gates, attempting to persuade Miss Murray to

<P>come in, I wished Mr. Weston would go, that she might not see him

<P>with me when she turned round; but, unfortunately, his business,

<P>which was to pay one more visit to poor Mark Wood, led him to

<P>pursue the same path as we did, till nearly the close of our

<P>journey.&nbsp; When, however, he saw that Rosalie had taken leave of
her

<P>friends and I was about to join her, he would have left me and

<P>passed on at a quicker pace; but, as he civilly lifted his hat in

<P>passing her, to my surprise, instead of returning the salute with a

<P>stiff, ungracious bow, she accosted him with one of her sweetest

<P>smiles, and, walking by his side, began to talk to him with all

<P>imaginable cheerfulness and affability; and so we proceeded all

<P>three together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short pause in the conversation, Mr. Weston made some

<P>remark addressed particularly to me, as referring to something we

<P>had been talking of before; but before I could answer, Miss Murray

<P>replied to the observation and enlarged upon it:&nbsp; he rejoined;
and,

<P>from thence to the close of the interview, she engrossed him

<P>entirely to herself.&nbsp; It might be partly owing to my own stupidity,

<P>my want of tact and assurance:&nbsp; but I felt myself wronged:&nbsp;
I

<P>trembled with apprehension; and I listened with envy to her easy,

<P>rapid flow of utterance, and saw with anxiety the bright smile with

<P>which she looked into his face from time to time:&nbsp; for she was

<P>walking a little in advance, for the purpose (as I judged) of being

<P>seen as well as heard.&nbsp; If her conversation was light and trivial,

<P>it was amusing, and she was never at a loss for something to say,

<P>or for suitable words to express it in.&nbsp; There was nothing pert
or

<P>flippant in her manner now, as when she walked with Mr. Hatfield,

<P>there was only a gentle, playful kind of vivacity, which I thought

<P>must be peculiarly pleasing to a man of Mr. Weston's disposition

<P>and temperament.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he was gone she began to laugh, and muttered to herself, 'I

<P>thought I could do it!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Do what?' I asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Fix that man.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'What in the world do you mean?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I mean that he will go home and dream of me.&nbsp; I have shot him

<P>through the heart!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How do you know?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'By many infallible proofs:&nbsp; more especially the look he gave me

<P>when he went away.&nbsp; It was not an impudent look - I exonerate him

<P>from that - it was a look of reverential, tender adoration.&nbsp; Ha,

<P>ha! he's not quite such a stupid blockhead as I thought him!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I made no answer, for my heart was in my throat, or something like

<P>it, and I could not trust myself to speak.&nbsp; 'O God, avert it!'
I

<P>cried, internally - 'for his sake, not for mine!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Murray made several trivial observations as we passed up the

<P>park, to which (in spite of my reluctance to let one glimpse of my

<P>feelings appear) I could only answer by monosyllables.&nbsp; Whether
she

<P>intended to torment me, or merely to amuse herself, I could not

<P>tell - and did not much care; but I thought of the poor man and his

<P>one lamb, and the rich man with his thousand flocks; and I dreaded

<P>I knew not what for Mr. Weston, independently of my own blighted

<P>hopes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Right glad was I to get into the house, and find myself alone once

<P>more in my own room.&nbsp; My first impulse was to sink into the chair

<P>beside the bed; and laying my head on the pillow, to seek relief in

<P>a passionate burst of tears:&nbsp; there was an imperative craving for

<P>such an indulgence; but, alas! I must restrain and swallow back my

<P>feelings still:&nbsp; there was the bell - the odious bell for the

<P>schoolroom dinner; and I must go down with a calm face, and smile,

<P>and laugh, and talk nonsense - yes, and eat, too, if possible, as

<P>if all was right, and I was just returned from a pleasant walk.
