<P>AS we drove along, my spirits revived again, and I turned, with

<P>pleasure, to the contemplation of the new life upon which I was

<P>entering.&nbsp; But though it was not far past the middle of September,

<P>the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to render

<P>the day extremely cold and dreary; and the journey seemed a very

<P>long one, for, as Smith observed, the roads were 'very heavy'; and

<P>certainly, his horse was very heavy too:&nbsp; it crawled up the hills,

<P>and crept down them, and only condescended to shake its sides in a

<P>trot where the road was at a dead level or a very gentle slope,

<P>which was rarely the case in those rugged regions; so that it was

<P>nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination.

<P>Yet, after all, when we entered the lofty iron gateway, when we

<P>drove softly up the smooth, well-rolled carriage-road, with the

<P>green lawn on each side, studded with young trees, and approached

<P>the new but stately mansion of Wellwood, rising above its mushroom

<P>poplar-groves, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or

<P>two farther off.&nbsp; For the first time in my life I must stand alone:

<P>there was no retreating now.&nbsp; I must enter that house, and

<P>introduce myself among its strange inhabitants.&nbsp; But how was it
to

<P>be done?&nbsp; True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to my retired
life

<P>and the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that

<P>many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly

<P>address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was.&nbsp; Yet,
if

<P>Mrs. Bloomfield were a kind, motherly woman, I might do very well,

<P>after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease

<P>with them - and Mr. Bloomfield, I hoped, I should have but little

<P>to do with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,' I said within myself; and

<P>truly I kept this resolution so well, and was so fully occupied in

<P>steadying my nerves and stifling the rebellious flutter of my

<P>heart, that when I was admitted into the hall and ushered into the

<P>presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite

<P>salutation; and it afterwards struck me, that the little I did say

<P>was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep.&nbsp; The lady,

<P>too, was somewhat chilly in her manner, as I discovered when I had

<P>time to reflect.&nbsp; She was a tall, spare, stately woman, with thick

<P>black hair, cold grey eyes, and extremely sallow complexion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me

<P>there to take a little refreshment.&nbsp; I was somewhat dismayed at
my

<P>appearance on looking in the glass:&nbsp; the cold wind had swelled
and

<P>reddened my hands, uncurled and entangled my hair, and dyed my face

<P>of a pale purple; add to this my collar was horridly crumpled, my

<P>frock splashed with mud, my feet clad in stout new boots, and as

<P>the trunks were not brought up, there was no remedy; so having

<P>smoothed my hair as well as I could, and repeatedly twitched my

<P>obdurate collar, I proceeded to clomp down the two flights of

<P>stairs, philosophizing as I went; and with some difficulty found my

<P>way into the room where Mrs. Bloomfield awaited me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She led me into the dining-room, where the family luncheon had been

<P>laid out.&nbsp; Some beefsteaks and half-cold potatoes were set before

<P>me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as

<P>I thought) and endeavouring to sustain something like a

<P>conversation - consisting chiefly of a succession of commonplace

<P>remarks, expressed with frigid formality:&nbsp; but this might be more

<P>my fault than hers, for I really could NOT converse.&nbsp; In fact,
my

<P>attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner:&nbsp; not from

<P>ravenous appetite, but from distress at the toughness of the

<P>beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands, almost palsied by their

<P>five-hours' exposure to the bitter wind.&nbsp; I would gladly have eaten

<P>the potatoes and let the meat alone, but having got a large piece

<P>of the latter on to my plate, I could not be so impolite as to

<P>leave it; so, after many awkward and unsuccessful attempts to cut

<P>it with the knife, or tear it with the fork, or pull it asunder

<P>between them, sensible that the awful lady was a spectator to the

<P>whole transaction, I at last desperately grasped the knife and fork

<P>in my fists, like a child of two years old, and fell to work with

<P>all the little strength I possessed.&nbsp; But this needed some apology

<P>- with a feeble attempt at a laugh, I said, 'My hands are so

<P>benumbed with the cold that I can scarcely handle my knife and

<P>fork.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I daresay you would find it cold,' replied she with a cool,

<P>immutable gravity that did not serve to re-assure me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the ceremony was concluded, she led me into the sitting-room

<P>again, where she rang and sent for the children.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You will find them not very far advanced in their attainments,'

<P>said she, 'for I have had so little time to attend to their

<P>education myself, and we have thought them too young for a

<P>governess till now; but I think they are clever children, and very

<P>apt to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower

<P>of the flock - a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but

<P>not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth.&nbsp; He seems

<P>to scorn deception' (this was good news).&nbsp; 'His sister Mary Ann

<P>will require watching,' continued she, 'but she is a very good girl

<P>upon the whole; though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as

<P>much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might

<P>acquire bad habits from the nurses.&nbsp; I have ordered her crib to
be

<P>placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to overlook her

<P>washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she need have

<P>nothing further to do with the nursery maid.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment my young

<P>pupils entered the apartment, with their two younger sisters.

<P>Master Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven, with a

<P>somewhat wiry frame, flaxen hair, blue eyes, small turned-up nose,

<P>and fair complexion.&nbsp; Mary Ann was a tall girl too, somewhat dark

<P>like her mother, but with a round full face and a high colour in

<P>her cheeks.&nbsp; The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little

<P>girl; Mrs. Bloomfield assured me she was a remarkably gentle child,

<P>and required encouragement:&nbsp; she had not learned anything yet;
but

<P>in a few days, she would be four years old, and then she might take

<P>her first lesson in the alphabet, and be promoted to the

<P>schoolroom.&nbsp; The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat,

<P>merry, playful thing of scarcely two, that I coveted more than all

<P>the rest - but with her I had nothing to do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I talked to my little pupils as well as I could, and tried to

<P>render myself agreeable; but with little success I fear, for their

<P>mother's presence kept me under an unpleasant restraint.&nbsp; They,

<P>however, were remarkably free from shyness.&nbsp; They seemed bold,

<P>lively children, and I hoped I should soon be on friendly terms

<P>with them - the little boy especially, of whom I had heard such a

<P>favourable character from his mamma.&nbsp; In Mary Ann there was a

<P>certain affected simper, and a craving for notice, that I was sorry

<P>to observe.&nbsp; But her brother claimed all my attention to himself;

<P>he stood bolt upright between me and the fire, with his hands

<P>behind his back, talking away like an orator, occasionally

<P>interrupting his discourse with a sharp reproof to his sisters when

<P>they made too much noise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Tom, what a darling you are!' exclaimed his mother.&nbsp; 'Come
and

<P>kiss dear mamma; and then won't you show Miss Grey your schoolroom,

<P>and your nice new books?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I won't kiss YOU, mamma; but I WILL show Miss Grey my schoolroom,

<P>and my new books.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And MY schoolroom, and MY new books, Tom,' said Mary Ann.

<P>'They're mine too.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'They're MINE,' replied he decisively.&nbsp; 'Come along, Miss Grey
-

<P>I'll escort you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the room and books had been shown, with some bickerings

<P>between the brother and sister that I did my utmost to appease or

<P>mitigate, Mary Ann brought me her doll, and began to be very

<P>loquacious on the subject of its fine clothes, its bed, its chest

<P>of drawers, and other appurtenances; but Tom told her to hold her

<P>clamour, that Miss Grey might see his rocking-horse, which, with a

<P>most important bustle, he dragged forth from its corner into the

<P>middle of the room, loudly calling on me to attend to it.&nbsp; Then,

<P>ordering his sister to hold the reins, he mounted, and made me

<P>stand for ten minutes, watching how manfully he used his whip and

<P>spurs.&nbsp; Meantime, however, I admired Mary Ann's pretty doll, and

<P>all its possessions; and then told Master Tom he was a capital

<P>rider, but I hoped he would not use his whip and spurs so much when

<P>he rode a real pony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, yes, I will!' said he, laying on with redoubled ardour.&nbsp; 'I'll

<P>cut into him like smoke!&nbsp; Eeh! my word! but he shall sweat for
it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was very shocking; but I hoped in time to be able to work a

<P>reformation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now you must put on your bonnet and shawl,' said the little hero,

<P>'and I'll show you my garden.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And MINE,' said Mary Ann.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom lifted his fist with a menacing gesture; she uttered a loud,

<P>shrill scream, ran to the other side of me, and made a face at him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Surely, Tom, you would not strike your sister!&nbsp; I hope I shall

<P>NEVER see you do that.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You will sometimes:&nbsp; I'm obliged to do it now and then to keep
her

<P>in order.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But it is not your business to keep her in order, you know - that

<P>is for - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, now go and put on your bonnet.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know - it is so very cloudy and cold, it seems likely to

<P>rain; - and you know I have had a long drive.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No matter - you MUST come; I shall allow of no excuses,' replied

<P>the consequential little gentleman.&nbsp; And, as it was the first day

<P>of our acquaintance, I thought I might as well indulge him.&nbsp; It
was

<P>too cold for Mary Ann to venture, so she stayed with her mamma, to

<P>the great relief of her brother, who liked to have me all to

<P>himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The garden was a large one, and tastefully laid out; besides

<P>several splendid dahlias, there were some other fine flowers still

<P>in bloom:&nbsp; but my companion would not give me time to examine them:

<P>I must go with him, across the wet grass, to a remote sequestered

<P>corner, the most important place in the grounds, because it

<P>contained HIS garden.&nbsp; There were two round beds, stocked with
a

<P>variety of plants.&nbsp; In one there was a pretty little rose-tree.&nbsp;
I

<P>paused to admire its lovely blossoms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, never mind that!' said he, contemptuously.&nbsp; 'That's only MARY

<P>ANN'S garden; look, THIS is mine.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After I had observed every flower, and listened to a disquisition

<P>on every plant, I was permitted to depart; but first, with great

<P>pomp, he plucked a polyanthus and presented it to me, as one

<P>conferring a prodigious favour.&nbsp; I observed, on the grass about
his

<P>garden, certain apparatus of sticks and corn, and asked what they

<P>were.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Traps for birds.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why do you catch them?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Papa says they do harm.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And what do you do with them when you catch them?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Different things.&nbsp; Sometimes I give them to the cat; sometimes
I

<P>cut them in pieces with my penknife; but the next, I mean to roast

<P>alive.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'For two reasons:&nbsp; first, to see how long it will live - and then,

<P>to see what it will taste like.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?

<P>Remember, the birds can feel as well as you; and think, how would

<P>you like it yourself?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, that's nothing!&nbsp; I'm not a bird, and I can't feel what I do
to

<P>them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But you will have to feel it some time, Tom:&nbsp; you have heard where

<P>wicked people go to when they die; and if you don't leave off

<P>torturing innocent birds, remember, you will have to go there, and

<P>suffer just what you have made them suffer.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, pooh!&nbsp; I shan't.&nbsp; Papa knows how I treat them, and he
never

<P>blames me for it:&nbsp; he says it is just what HE used to do when HE

<P>was a boy.&nbsp; Last summer, he gave me a nest full of young sparrows,

<P>and he saw me pulling off their legs and wings, and heads, and

<P>never said anything; except that they were nasty things, and I must

<P>not let them soil my trousers:&nbsp; end Uncle Robson was there too,
and

<P>he laughed, and said I was a fine boy.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But what would your mamma say?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, she doesn't care! she says it's a pity to kill the pretty

<P>singing birds, but the naughty sparrows, and mice, and rats, I may

<P>do what I like with.&nbsp; So now, Miss Grey, you see it is NOT wicked.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I still think it is, Tom; and perhaps your papa and mamma would

<P>think so too, if they thought much about it.&nbsp; However,' I

<P>internally added, 'they may say what they please, but I am

<P>determined you shall do nothing of the kind, as long as I have

<P>power to prevent it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He next took me across the lawn to see his mole-traps, and then

<P>into the stack-yard to see his weasel-traps:&nbsp; one of which, to
his

<P>great joy, contained a dead weasel; and then into the stable to

<P>see, not the fine carriage-horses, but a little rough colt, which

<P>he informed me had been bred on purpose for him, and he was to ride

<P>it as soon as it was properly trained.&nbsp; I tried to amuse the little

<P>fellow, and listened to all his chatter as complacently as I could;

<P>for I thought if he had any affections at all, I would endeavour to

<P>win them; and then, in time, I might be able to show him the error

<P>of his ways:&nbsp; but I looked in vain for that generous, noble spirit

<P>his mother talked of; though I could see he was not without a

<P>certain degree of quickness and penetration, when he chose to exert

<P>it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When we re-entered the house it was nearly tea-time.&nbsp; Master Tom

<P>told me that, as papa was from home, he and I and Mary Ann were to

<P>have tea with mamma, for a treat; for, on such occasions, she

<P>always dined at luncheon-time with them, instead of at six o'clock.

<P>Soon after tea, Mary Ann went to bed, but Tom favoured us with his

<P>company and conversation till eight.&nbsp; After he was gone, Mrs.

<P>Bloomfield further enlightened me on the subject of her children's

<P>dispositions and acquirements, and on what they were to learn, and

<P>how they were to be managed, and cautioned me to mention their

<P>defects to no one but herself.&nbsp; My mother had warned me before
to

<P>mention them as little as possible to HER, for people did not like

<P>to be told of their children's faults, and so I concluded I was to

<P>keep silence on them altogether.&nbsp; About half-past nine, Mrs.

<P>Bloomfield invited me to partake of a frugal supper of cold meat

<P>and bread.&nbsp; I was glad when that was over, and she took her bedroom

<P>candlestick and retired to rest; for though I wished to be pleased

<P>with her, her company was extremely irksome to me; and I could not

<P>help feeling that she was cold, grave, and forbidding - the very

<P>opposite of the kind, warm-hearted matron my hopes had depicted her

<P>to be.
