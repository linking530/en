<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER VIII - THE 'COMING OUT'</FONT></B>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>AT eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of

<P>the schoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world - as

<P>much of it, at least, as could be had out of London; for her papa

<P>could not be persuaded to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits,

<P>even for a few weeks' residence in town.&nbsp; She was to make her debut

<P>on the third of January, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma

<P>proposed to give to all the nobility and choice gentry of O- and

<P>its neighbourhood for twenty miles round.&nbsp; Of course, she looked

<P>forward to it with the wildest impatience, and the most extravagant

<P>anticipations of delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Miss Grey,' said she, one evening, a month before the all-

<P>important day, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting

<P>letter of my sister's - which I had just glanced at in the morning

<P>to see that it contained no very bad news, and kept till now,

<P>unable before to find a quiet moment for reading it, - 'Miss Grey,

<P>do put away that dull, stupid letter, and listen to me!&nbsp; I'm sure

<P>my talk must be far more amusing than that.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing

<P>a sigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You should tell the good people at home not to bore you with such

<P>long letters,' said she; 'and, above all, do bid them write on

<P>proper note-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets.&nbsp; You

<P>should see the charming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her

<P>friends.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The good people at home,' replied I, 'know very well that the

<P>longer their letters are, the better I like them.&nbsp; I should be
very

<P>sorry to receive a charming little lady-like note from any of them;

<P>and I thought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray, to

<P>talk about the "vulgarity" of writing on a large sheet of paper.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I only said it to tease you.&nbsp; But now I want to talk about

<P>the ball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your

<P>holidays till it is over.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why so? - I shall not be present at the ball.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and

<P>hear the music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress.&nbsp;
I

<P>shall be so charming, you'll be ready to worship me - you really

<P>must stay.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I should like to see you very much; but I shall have many

<P>opportunities of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of

<P>some of the numberless balls and parties that are to be, and I

<P>cannot disappoint my friends by postponing my return so long.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, never mind your friends!&nbsp; Tell them we won't let you go.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself:&nbsp;
I

<P>long to see them as much as they to see me - perhaps more.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, but it is such a short time.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Nearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot bear

<P>the thoughts of a Christmas spent from home:&nbsp; and, moreover, my

<P>sister is going to be married.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Is she - when?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Not till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in

<P>making preparations, and to make the best of her company while we

<P>have her.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why didn't you tell me before?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I've only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize as

<P>dull and stupid, and won't let me read.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To whom is she to be married?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Is he rich?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; only comfortable.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Is he handsome?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; only decent.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Young?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; only middling.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, mercy! what a wretch!&nbsp; What sort of a house is it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'A quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned

<P>garden, and - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, stop! - you'll make me sick.&nbsp; How CAN she bear it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I expect she'll not only be able to bear it, but to be very happy.

<P>You did not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good, wise, or amiable

<P>man; I could have answered Yes, to all these questions - at least

<P>so Mary thinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But - miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life

<P>there, cooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He is not old:&nbsp; he's only six or seven and thirty; and she herself

<P>is twenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh! that's better then - they're well matched; but do they call

<P>him the "worthy vicar"?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make pies

<P>and puddings?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I don't know about the white apron, but I dare say she will make

<P>pies and puddings now and then; but that will be no great hardship,

<P>as she has done it before.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet,

<P>carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I'm not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her best to

<P>make them comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our

<P>mother's example.'
