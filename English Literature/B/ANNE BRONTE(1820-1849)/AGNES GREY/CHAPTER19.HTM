<P>MY father's mortal remains had been consigned to the tomb; and we,

<P>with sad faces and sombre garments, sat lingering over the frugal

<P>breakfast-table, revolving plans for our future life.&nbsp; My mother's

<P>strong mind had not given way beneath even this affliction:&nbsp; her

<P>spirit, though crushed, was not broken.&nbsp; Mary's wish was that I

<P>should go back to Horton Lodge, and that our mother should come and

<P>live with her and Mr. Richardson at the vicarage:&nbsp; she affirmed

<P>that he wished it no less than herself, and that such an

<P>arrangement could not fail to benefit all parties; for my mother's

<P>society and experience would be of inestimable value to them, and

<P>they would do all they could to make her happy.&nbsp; But no arguments

<P>or entreaties could prevail:&nbsp; my mother was determined not to go.

<P>Not that she questioned, for a moment, the kind wishes and

<P>intentions of her daughter; but she affirmed that so long as God

<P>spared her health and strength, she would make use of them to earn

<P>her own livelihood, and be chargeable to no one; whether her

<P>dependence would be felt as a burden or not.&nbsp; If she could afford

<P>to reside as a lodger in - vicarage, she would choose that house

<P>before all others as the place of her abode; but not being so

<P>circumstanced, she would never come under its roof, except as an

<P>occasional visitor:&nbsp; unless sickness or calamity should render
her

<P>assistance really needful, or until age or infirmity made her

<P>incapable of maintaining herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, Mary,' said she, 'if Richardson and you have anything to

<P>spare, you must lay it aside for your family; and Agnes and I must

<P>gather honey for ourselves.&nbsp; Thanks to my having had daughters
to

<P>educate, I have not forgotten my accomplishments.&nbsp; God willing,
I

<P>will check this vain repining,' she said, while the tears coursed

<P>one another down her cheeks in spite of her efforts; but she wiped

<P>them away, and resolutely shaking back her head, continued, 'I will

<P>exert myself, and look out for a small house, commodiously situated

<P>in some populous but healthy district, where we will take a few

<P>young ladies to board and educate - if we can get them - and as

<P>many day pupils as will come, or as we can manage to instruct.

<P>Your father's relations and old friends will be able to send us

<P>some pupils, or to assist us with their recommendations, no doubt:

<P>I shall not apply to my own.&nbsp; What say you to it, Agnes? will you

<P>be willing to leave your present situation and try?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Quite willing, mamma; and the money I have saved will do to

<P>furnish the house.&nbsp; It shall be taken from the bank directly.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'When it is wanted:&nbsp; we must get the house, and settle on

<P>preliminaries first.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary offered to lend the little she possessed; but my mother

<P>declined it, saying that we must begin on an economical plan; and

<P>she hoped that the whole or part of mine, added to what we could

<P>get by the sale of the furniture, and what little our dear papa had

<P>contrived to lay aside for her since the debts were paid, would be

<P>sufficient to last us till Christmas; when, it was hoped, something

<P>would accrue from our united labours.&nbsp; It was finally settled that

<P>this should be our plan; and that inquiries and preparations should

<P>immediately be set on foot; and while my mother busied herself with

<P>these, I should return to Horton Lodge at the close of my four

<P>weeks' vacation, and give notice for my final departure when things

<P>were in train for the speedy commencement of our school.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We were discussing these affairs on the morning I have mentioned,

<P>about a fortnight after my father's death, when a letter was

<P>brought in for my mother, on beholding which the colour mounted to

<P>her face - lately pale enough with anxious watchings and excessive

<P>sorrow.&nbsp; 'From my father!' murmured she, as she hastily tore off

<P>the cover.&nbsp; It was many years since she had heard from any of her

<P>own relations before.&nbsp; Naturally wondering what the letter might

<P>contain, I watched her countenance while she read it, and was

<P>somewhat surprised to see her bite her lip and knit her brows as if

<P>in anger.&nbsp; When she had done, she somewhat irreverently cast it
on

<P>the table, saying with a scornful smile, - 'Your grandpapa has been

<P>so kind as to write to me.&nbsp; He says he has no doubt I have long

<P>repented of my "unfortunate marriage," and if I will only

<P>acknowledge this, and confess I was wrong in neglecting his advice,

<P>and that I have justly suffered for it, he will make a lady of me

<P>once again - if that be possible after my long degradation - and

<P>remember my girls in his will.&nbsp; Get my desk, Agnes, and send these

<P>things away:&nbsp; I will answer the letter directly.&nbsp; But first,
as I

<P>may be depriving you both of a legacy, it is just that I should

<P>tell you what I mean to say.&nbsp; I shall say that he is mistaken in

<P>supposing that I can regret the birth of my daughters (who have

<P>been the pride of my life, and are likely to be the comfort of my

<P>old age), or the thirty years I have passed in the company of my

<P>best and dearest friend; - that, had our misfortunes been three

<P>times as great as they were (unless they had been of my bringing

<P>on), I should still the more rejoice to have shared them with your

<P>father, and administered what consolation I was able; and, had his

<P>sufferings in illness been ten times what they wore, I could not

<P>regret having watched over and laboured to relieve them; - that, if

<P>he had married a richer wife, misfortunes and trials would no doubt

<P>have come upon him still; while I am egotist enough to imagine that

<P>no other woman could have cheered him through them so well:&nbsp; not

<P>that I am superior to the rest, but I was made for him, and he for

<P>me; and I can no more repent the hours, days, years of happiness we

<P>have spent together, and which neither could have had without the

<P>other, than I can the privilege of having been his nurse in

<P>sickness, and his comfort in affliction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Will this do, children? - or shall I say we are all very sorry for

<P>what has happened during the last thirty years, and my daughters

<P>wish they had never been born; but since they have had that

<P>misfortune, they will be thankful for any trifle their grandpapa

<P>will be kind enough to bestow?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course, we both applauded our mother's resolution; Mary cleared

<P>away the breakfast things; I brought the desk; the letter was

<P>quickly written and despatched; and, from that day, we heard no

<P>more of our grandfather, till we saw his death announced in the

<P>newspaper a considerable time after - all his worldly possessions,

<P>of course, being left to our wealthy unknown cousins.
