<P>THE 1st of June arrived at last:&nbsp; and Rosalie Murray was transmuted

<P>into Lady Ashby.&nbsp; Most splendidly beautiful she looked in her

<P>bridal costume.&nbsp; Upon her return from church, after the ceremony,

<P>she came flying into the schoolroom, flushed with excitement, and

<P>laughing, half in mirth, and half in reckless desperation, as it

<P>seemed to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, Miss Grey, I'm Lady Ashby!' she exclaimed.&nbsp; 'It's done, my

<P>fate is sealed:&nbsp; there's no drawing back now.&nbsp; I'm come to
receive

<P>your congratulations and bid you good-by; and then I'm off for

<P>Paris, Rome, Naples, Switzerland, London - oh, dear! what a deal I

<P>shall see and hear before I come back again.&nbsp; But don't forget
me:

<P>I shan't forget you, though I've been a naughty girl.&nbsp; Come, why

<P>don't you congratulate me?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I cannot congratulate you,' I replied, 'till I know whether this

<P>change is really for the better:&nbsp; but I sincerely hope it is; and
I

<P>wish you true happiness and the best of blessings.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, good-by, the carriage is waiting, and they're calling me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She gave me a hasty kiss, and was hurrying away; but, suddenly

<P>returning, embraced me with more affection than I thought her

<P>capable of evincing, and departed with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Poor

<P>girl!&nbsp; I really loved her then; and forgave her from my heart all

<P>the injury she had done me - and others also:&nbsp; she had not half

<P>known it, I was sure; and I prayed God to pardon her too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During the remainder of that day of festal sadness, I was left to

<P>my own devices.&nbsp; Being too much unhinged for any steady occupation,

<P>I wandered about with a book in my hand for several hours, more

<P>thinking than reading, for I had many things to think about.&nbsp; In

<P>the evening, I made use of my liberty to go and see my old friend

<P>Nancy once again; to apologize for my long absence (which must have

<P>seemed so neglectful and unkind) by telling her how busy I had

<P>been; and to talk, or read, or work for her, whichever might be

<P>most acceptable, and also, of course, to tell her the news of this

<P>important day:&nbsp; and perhaps to obtain a little information from
her

<P>in return, respecting Mr. Weston's expected departure.&nbsp; But of
this

<P>she seemed to know nothing, and I hoped, as she did, that it was

<P>all a false report.&nbsp; She was very glad to see me; but, happily,
her

<P>eyes were now so nearly well that she was almost independent of my

<P>services.&nbsp; She was deeply interested in the wedding; but while
I

<P>amused her with the details of the festive day, the splendours of

<P>the bridal party and of the bride herself, she often sighed and

<P>shook her head, and wished good might come of it; she seemed, like

<P>me, to regard it rather as a theme for sorrow than rejoicing.&nbsp;
I

<P>sat a long time talking to her about that and other things - but no

<P>one came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shall I confess that I sometimes looked towards the door with a

<P>half-expectant wish to see it open and give entrance to Mr. Weston,

<P>as had happened once before? and that, returning through the lanes

<P>and fields, I often paused to look round me, and walked more slowly

<P>than was at all necessary - for, though a fine evening, it was not

<P>a hot one - and, finally, felt a sense of emptiness and

<P>disappointment at having reached the house without meeting or even

<P>catching a distant glimpse of any one, except a few labourers

<P>returning from their work?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sunday, however, was approaching:&nbsp; I should see him then:&nbsp;
for now

<P>that Miss Murray was gone, I could have my old corner again.&nbsp; I

<P>should see him, and by look, speech, and manner, I might judge

<P>whether the circumstance of her marriage had very much afflicted

<P>him.&nbsp; Happily I could perceive no shadow of a difference:&nbsp;
he wore

<P>the same aspect as he had worn two months ago - voice, look,

<P>manner, all alike unchanged:&nbsp; there was the same keen-sighted,

<P>unclouded truthfulness in his discourse, the same forcible

<P>clearness in his style, the same earnest simplicity in all he said

<P>and did, that made itself, not marked by the eye and ear, but felt

<P>upon the hearts of his audience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I walked home with Miss Matilda; but HE DID NOT JOIN US.&nbsp; Matilda

<P>was now sadly at a loss for amusement, and wofully in want of a

<P>companion:&nbsp; her brothers at school, her sister married and gone,

<P>she too young to be admitted into society; for which, from

<P>Rosalie's example, she was in some degree beginning to acquire a

<P>taste - a taste at least for the company of certain classes of

<P>gentlemen; at this dull time of year - no hunting going on, no

<P>shooting even - for, though she might not join in that, it was

<P>SOMETHING to see her father or the gamekeeper go out with the dogs,

<P>and to talk with them on their return, about the different birds

<P>they had bagged.&nbsp; Now, also, she was denied the solace which the

<P>companionship of the coachman, grooms, horses, greyhounds, and

<P>pointers might have afforded; for her mother having,

<P>notwithstanding the disadvantages of a country life, so

<P>satisfactorily disposed of her elder daughter, the pride of her

<P>heart had begun seriously to turn her attention to the younger;

<P>and, being truly alarmed at the roughness of her manners, and

<P>thinking it high time to work a reform, had been roused at length

<P>to exert her authority, and prohibited entirely the yards, stables,

<P>kennels, and coachhouse.&nbsp; Of course, she was not implicitly obeyed;

<P>but, indulgent as she had hitherto been, when once her spirit was

<P>roused, her temper was not so gentle as she required that of her

<P>governesses to be, and her will was not to be thwarted with

<P>impunity.&nbsp; After many a scene of contention between mother and

<P>daughter, many a violent outbreak which I was ashamed to witness,

<P>in which the father's authority was often called in to confirm with

<P>oaths and threats the mother's slighted prohibitions - for even HE

<P>could see that 'Tilly, though she would have made a fine lad, was

<P>not quite what a young lady ought to be' - Matilda at length found

<P>that her easiest plan was to keep clear of the forbidden regions;

<P>unless she could now and then steal a visit without her watchful

<P>mother's knowledge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amid all this, let it not be imagined that I escaped without many a

<P>reprimand, and many an implied reproach, that lost none of its

<P>sting from not being openly worded; but rather wounded the more

<P>deeply, because, from that very reason, it seemed to preclude self-

<P>defence.&nbsp; Frequently, I was told to amuse Miss Matilda with other

<P>things, and to remind her of her mother's precepts and

<P>prohibitions.&nbsp; I did so to the best of my power:&nbsp; but she
would not

<P>be amused against her will, and could not against her taste; and

<P>though I went beyond mere reminding, such gentle remonstrances as I

<P>could use were utterly ineffectual.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'DEAR Miss Grey! it is the STRANGEST thing.&nbsp; I suppose you can't

<P>help it, if it's not in your nature - but I WONDER you can't win

<P>the confidence of that girl, and make your society at LEAST as

<P>agreeable to her as that of Robert or Joseph!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'They can talk the best about the things in which she is most

<P>interested,' I replied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well! that is a strange confession, HOWEVER, to come from her

<P>GOVERNESS!&nbsp; Who is to form a young lady's tastes, I wonder, if
the

<P>governess doesn't do it?&nbsp; I have known governesses who have so

<P>completely identified themselves with the reputation of their young

<P>ladies for elegance and propriety in mind and manners, that they

<P>would blush to speak a word against them; and to hear the slightest

<P>blame imputed to their pupils was worse than to be censured in

<P>their own persons - and I really think it very natural, for my

<P>part.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Do you, ma'am?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, of course:&nbsp; the young lady's proficiency and elegance is
of

<P>more consequence to the governess than her own, as well as to the

<P>world.&nbsp; If she wishes to prosper in her vocation she must devote

<P>all her energies to her business:&nbsp; all her ideas and all her

<P>ambition will tend to the accomplishment of that one object.&nbsp; When

<P>we wish to decide upon the merits of a governess, we naturally look

<P>at the young ladies she professes to have educated, and judge

<P>accordingly.&nbsp; The JUDICIOUS governess knows this:&nbsp; she knows
that,

<P>while she lives in obscurity herself, her pupils' virtues and

<P>defects will be open to every eye; and that, unless she loses sight

<P>of herself in their cultivation, she need not hope for success.

<P>You see, Miss Grey, it is just the same as any other trade or

<P>profession:&nbsp; they that wish to prosper must devote themselves body

<P>and soul to their calling; and if they begin to yield to indolence

<P>or self-indulgence they are speedily distanced by wiser

<P>competitors:&nbsp; there is little to choose between a person that ruins

<P>her pupils by neglect, and one that corrupts them by her example.

<P>You will excuse my dropping these little hints:&nbsp; you know it is
all

<P>for your own good.&nbsp; Many ladies would speak to you much more

<P>strongly; and many would not trouble themselves to speak at all,

<P>but quietly look out for a substitute.&nbsp; That, of course, would
be

<P>the EASIEST plan:&nbsp; but I know the advantages of a place like this

<P>to a person in your situation; and I have no desire to part with

<P>you, as I am sure you would do very well if you will only think of

<P>these things and try to exert yourself a LITTLE more:&nbsp; then, I
am

<P>convinced, you would SOON acquire that delicate tact which alone is

<P>wanting to give you a proper influence over the mind of your

<P>pupil.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was about to give the lady some idea of the fallacy of her

<P>expectations; but she sailed away as soon as she had concluded her

<P>speech.&nbsp; Having said what she wished, it was no part of her plan
to

<P>await my answer:&nbsp; it was my business to hear, and not to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However, as I have said, Matilda at length yielded in some degree

<P>to her mother's authority (pity it had not been exerted before);

<P>and being thus deprived of almost every source of amusement, there

<P>was nothing for it but to take long rides with the groom and long

<P>walks with the governess, and to visit the cottages and farmhouses

<P>on her father's estate, to kill time in chatting with the old men

<P>and women that inhabited them.&nbsp; In one of these walks, it was our

<P>chance to meet Mr. Weston.&nbsp; This was what I had long desired; but

<P>now, for a moment, I wished either he or I were away:&nbsp; I felt my

<P>heart throb so violently that I dreaded lest some outward signs of

<P>emotion should appear; but I think he hardly glanced at me, and I

<P>was soon calm enough.&nbsp; After a brief salutation to both, he asked

<P>Matilda if she had lately heard from her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes,' replied she.&nbsp; 'She was at Paris when she wrote, and very

<P>well, and very happy.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She spoke the last word emphatically, and with a glance

<P>impertinently sly.&nbsp; He did not seem to notice it, but replied,
with

<P>equal emphasis, and very seriously -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I hope she will continue to be so.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Do you think it likely?' I ventured to inquire:&nbsp; for Matilda had

<P>started off in pursuit of her dog, that was chasing a leveret.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I cannot tell,' replied he.&nbsp; 'Sir Thomas may be a better man than

<P>I suppose; but, from all I have heard and seen, it seems a pity

<P>that one so young and gay, and - and interesting, to express many

<P>things by one word - whose greatest, if not her only fault, appears

<P>to be thoughtlessness - no trifling fault to be sure, since it

<P>renders the possessor liable to almost every other, and exposes him

<P>to so many temptations - but it seems a pity that she should be

<P>thrown away on such a man.&nbsp; It was her mother's wish, I suppose?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes; and her own too, I think, for she always laughed at my

<P>attempts to dissuade her from the step.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You did attempt it?&nbsp; Then, at least, you will have the

<P>satisfaction of knowing that it is no fault of yours, if any harm

<P>should come of it.&nbsp; As for Mrs. Murray, I don't know how she can

<P>justify her conduct:&nbsp; if I had sufficient acquaintance with her,

<P>I'd ask her.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It seems unnatural:&nbsp; but some people think rank and wealth the

<P>chief good; and, if they can secure that for their children, they

<P>think they have done their duty.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'True:&nbsp; but is it not strange that persons of experience, who have

<P>been married themselves, should judge so falsely?'&nbsp; Matilda now

<P>came panting back, with the lacerated body of the young hare in her

<P>hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Was it your intention to kill that hare, or to save it, Miss

<P>Murray?' asked Mr. Weston, apparently puzzled at her gleeful

<P>countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I pretended to want to save it,' she answered, honestly enough,

<P>'as it was so glaringly out of season; but I was better pleased to

<P>see it lolled.&nbsp; However, you can both witness that I couldn't help

<P>it:&nbsp; Prince was determined to have her; and he clutched her by
the

<P>back, and killed her in a minute!&nbsp; Wasn't it a noble chase?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Very! for a young lady after a leveret.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a quiet sarcasm in the tone of his reply which was not

<P>lost upon her; she shrugged her shoulders, and, turning away with a

<P>significant 'Humph!' asked me how I had enjoyed the fun.&nbsp; I replied

<P>that I saw no fun in the matter; but admitted that I had not

<P>observed the transaction very narrowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Didn't you see how it doubled - just like an old hare? and didn't

<P>you hear it scream?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I'm happy to say I did not.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It cried out just like a child.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Poor little thing!&nbsp; What will you do with it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Come along - I shall leave it in the first house we come to.&nbsp;
I

<P>don't want to take it home, for fear papa should scold me for

<P>letting the dog kill it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston was now gone, and we too went on our way; but as we

<P>returned, after having deposited the hare in a farm-house, and

<P>demolished some spice-cake and currant-wine in exchange, we met him

<P>returning also from the execution of his mission, whatever it might

<P>be.&nbsp; He carried in his hand a cluster of beautiful bluebells, which

<P>he offered to me; observing, with a smile, that though he had seen

<P>so little of me for the last two months, he had not forgotten that

<P>blue-bells were numbered among my favourite flowers.&nbsp; It was done

<P>as a simple act of goodwill, without compliment or remarkable

<P>courtesy, or any look that could be construed into 'reverential,

<P>tender adoration' (VIDE Rosalie Murray); but still, it was

<P>something to find my unimportant saying so well remembered:&nbsp; it
was

<P>something that he had noticed so accurately the time I had ceased

<P>to be visible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I was told,' said he, 'that you were a perfect bookworm, Miss

<P>Grey:&nbsp; so completely absorbed in your studies that you were lost
to

<P>every other pleasure.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes, and it's quite true!' cried Matilda.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No, Mr. Weston:&nbsp; don't believe it:&nbsp; it's a scandalous libel.

<P>These young ladies are too fond of making random assertions at the

<P>expense of their friends; and you ought to be careful how you

<P>listen to them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I hope THIS assertion is groundless, at any rate.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Why?&nbsp; Do you particularly object to ladies studying?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'No; but I object to anyone so devoting himself or herself to

<P>study, as to lose sight of everything else.&nbsp; Except under peculiar

<P>circumstances, I consider very close and constant study as a waste

<P>of time, and an injury to the mind as well as the body.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, I have neither the time nor the inclination for such

<P>transgressions.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We parted again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well! what is there remarkable in all this?&nbsp; Why have I recorded

<P>it?&nbsp; Because, reader, it was important enough to give me a cheerful

<P>evening, a night of pleasing dreams, and a morning of felicitous

<P>hopes.&nbsp; Shallow-brained cheerfulness, foolish dreams, unfounded

<P>hopes, you would say; and I will not venture to deny it:

<P>suspicions to that effect arose too frequently in my own mind.&nbsp;
But

<P>our wishes are like tinder:&nbsp; the flint and steel of circumstances

<P>are continually striking out sparks, which vanish immediately,

<P>unless they chance to fall upon the tinder of our wishes; then,

<P>they instantly ignite, and the flame of hope is kindled in a

<P>moment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But alas! that very morning, my flickering flame of hope was

<P>dismally quenched by a letter from my mother, which spoke so

<P>seriously of my father's increasing illness, that I feared there

<P>was little or no chance of his recovery; and, close at hand as the

<P>holidays were, I almost trembled lest they should come too late for

<P>me to meet him in this world.&nbsp; Two days after, a letter from Mary

<P>told me his life was despaired of, and his end seemed fast

<P>approaching.&nbsp; Then, immediately, I sought permission to anticipate

<P>the vacation, and go without delay.&nbsp; Mrs. Murray stared, and

<P>wondered at the unwonted energy and boldness with which I urged the

<P>request, and thought there was no occasion to hurry; but finally

<P>gave me leave:&nbsp; stating, however, that there was 'no need to be
in

<P>such agitation about the matter - it might prove a false alarm

<P>after all; and if not - why, it was only in the common course of

<P>nature:&nbsp; we must all die some time; and I was not to suppose myself

<P>the only afflicted person in the world;' and concluding with saying

<P>I might have the phaeton to take me to O-.&nbsp; 'And instead of

<P>REPINING, Miss Grey, be thankful for the PRIVILEGES you enjoy.

<P>There's many a poor clergyman whose family would be plunged into

<P>ruin by the event of his death; but you, you see, have influential

<P>friends ready to continue their patronage, and to show you every

<P>consideration.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I thanked her for her 'consideration,' and flew to my room to make

<P>some hurried preparations for my departure.&nbsp; My bonnet and shawl

<P>being on, and a few things hastily crammed into my largest trunk, I

<P>descended.&nbsp; But I might have done the work more leisurely, for
no

<P>one else was in a hurry; and I had still a considerable time to

<P>wait for the phaeton.&nbsp; At length it came to the door, and I was

<P>off:&nbsp; but, oh, what a dreary journey was that! how utterly

<P>different from my former passages homewards!&nbsp; Being too late for

<P>the last coach to -, I had to hire a cab for ten miles, and then a

<P>car to take me over the rugged hills.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was half-past ten before I reached home.&nbsp; They were not in bed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My mother and sister both met me in the passage - sad - silent -

<P>pale!&nbsp; I was so much shocked and terror-stricken that I could not

<P>speak, to ask the information I so much longed yet dreaded to

<P>obtain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Agnes!' said my mother, struggling to repress some strong emotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, Agnes!' cried Mary, and burst into tears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'How is he?' I asked, gasping for the answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Dead!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was the reply I had anticipated:&nbsp; but the shock seemed none
the

<P>less tremendous.
