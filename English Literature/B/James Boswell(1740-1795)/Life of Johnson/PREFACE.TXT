Preface





In making this abridgement of Boswell's Life of Johnson I have

omitted most of Boswell's criticisms, comments, and notes, all of

Johnson's opinions in legal cases, most of the letters, and parts

of the conversation dealing with matters which were of greater

importance in Boswell's day than now.  I have kept in mind an old

habit, common enough, I dare say, among its devotees, of opening

the book of random, and reading wherever the eye falls upon a

passage of especial interest.  All such passages, I hope, have been

retained, and enough of the whole book to illustrate all the phases

of Johnson's mind and of his time which Boswell observed.



Loyal Johnsonians may look upon such a book with a measure of

scorn.  I could not have made it, had I not believed that it would

be the means of drawing new readers to Boswell, and eventually of

finding for them in the complete work what many have already found--

days and years of growing enlightenment and happy companionship,

and an innocent refuge from the cares and perturbations of life.
