<P>JUDGES ought to remember, that their office is

<P>jus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law,

<P>and not to make law, or give law.&nbsp; Else will it be

<P>like the authority, claimed by the Church of Rome,

<P>which under pretext of exposition of Scripture,

<P>doth not stick to add and alter; and to pronounce

<P>that which they do not find; and by show of an-

<P>tiquity, to introduce novelty.&nbsp; Judges ought to be

<P>more learned, than witty, more reverend, than

<P>plausible,and more advised, than confident.&nbsp; Above

<P>all things, integrity is their portion and proper

<P>virtue.&nbsp; Cursed (saith the law) is he that removeth

<P>the landmark.&nbsp; The mislayer of a mere-stone is to

<P>blame.&nbsp; But it is the unjust judge, that is the capital

<P>remover of landmarks, when he defineth amiss, of

<P>lands and property.&nbsp; One foul sentence doth more

<P>hurt, than many foul examples.&nbsp; For these do but

<P>corrupt the stream, the other corrupteth the foun-

<P>tain.&nbsp; So with Solomon, Fons turbatus, et vena

<P>corrupta, est justus cadens in causa sua coram

<P>adversario.&nbsp; The office of judges may have reference

<P>unto the parties that use, unto the advocates that

<P>plead, unto the clerks and ministers of justice

<P>underneath them, and to the sovereign or state

<P>above them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First, for the causes or parties that sue.&nbsp; There be

<P>(saith the Scripture) that turn judgment, into

<P>wormwood; and surely there be also, that turn it

<P>into vinegar; for injustice maketh it bitter, and

<P>delays make it sour.&nbsp; The principal duty of a judge,

<P>is to suppress force and fraud; whereof force is the

<P>more pernicious, when it is open, and fraud, when

<P>it is close and disguised.&nbsp; Add thereto contentious

<P>suits, which ought to be spewed out, as the surfeit

<P>of courts.&nbsp; A judge ought to prepare his way to a

<P>just sentence, as God useth to prepare his way, by

<P>raising valleys and taking down hills: so when

<P>there appeareth on either side an high hand, vio-

<P>lent prosecution, cunning advantages taken, com-

<P>bination, power, great counsel, then is the virtue

<P>of a judge seen, to make inequality equal; that he

<P>may plant his judgment as upon an even ground.

<P>Qui fortiter emungit, elicit sanguinem; and where

<P>the wine-press is hard wrought, it yields a harsh

<P>wine, that tastes of the grape-stone.&nbsp; Judges must

<P>beware of hard constructions, and strained infer-

<P>ences; for there is no worse torture, than the tor-

<P>ture of laws.&nbsp; Specially in case of laws penal, they

<P>ought to have care, that that which was meant for

<P>terror, be not turned into rigor; and that they

<P>bring not upon the people, that shower whereof

<P>the Scripture speaketh, Pluet super eos laqueos;

<P>for penal laws pressed, are a shower of snares upon

<P>the people.&nbsp; Therefore let penal laws, if they have

<P>been sleepers of long, or if they be grown unfit for

<P>the present time, be by wise judges confined in the

<P>execution: Judicis officium est, ut res, ita tempora

<P>rerum, etc.&nbsp; In causes of life and death, judges ought

<P>(as far as the law permitteth) in justice to remem-

<P>ber mercy; and to cast a severe eye upon the

<P>example, but a merciful eye upon the person.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Secondly, for the advocates and counsel that

<P>plead.&nbsp; Patience and gravity of hearing, is an essen-

<P>tial part of justice; and an overspeaking judge is no

<P>well-tuned cymbal.&nbsp; It is no grace to a judge, first

<P>to find that, which he might have heard in due

<P>time from the bar; or to show quickness of conceit,

<P>in cutting off evidence or counsel too short; or to

<P>prevent information by questions, though perti-

<P>nent.&nbsp; The parts of a judge in hearing, are four: to

<P>direct the evidence; to moderate length, repetition,

<P>or impertinency of speech; to recapitulate, select,

<P>and collate the material points, of that which hath

<P>been said; and to give the rule or sentence.&nbsp; What-

<P>soever is above these is too much; and proceedeth

<P>either of glory, and willingness to speak, or of im-

<P>patience to hear, or of shortness of memory, or of

<P>want of a staid and equal attention.&nbsp; It is a strange

<P>thing to see, that the boldness of advocates should

<P>prevail with judges; whereas they should imitate

<P>God, in whose seat they sit; who represseth the pre-

<P>sumptuous, and giveth grace to the modest.&nbsp; But it

<P>is more strange, that judges should have noted

<P>favorites; which cannot but cause multiplication

<P>of fees, and suspicion of by-ways.&nbsp; There is due from

<P>the judge to the advocate, some commendation

<P>and gracing, where causes are well handled and

<P>fair pleaded; especially towards the side which

<P>obtaineth not; for that upholds in the client, the

<P>reputation of his counsel, and beats down in him

<P>the conceit of his cause.&nbsp; There is likewise due to the

<P>public, a civil reprehension of advocates, where

<P>there appeareth cunning counsel, gross neglect,

<P>slight information, indiscreet pressing, or an over-

<P>bold defence.&nbsp; And let not the counsel at the bar,

<P>chop with the judge, nor wind himself into the

<P>handling of the cause anew, after the judge hath

<P>declared his sentence; but, on the other side, let

<P>not the judge meet the cause half way, nor give

<P>occasion to the party, to say his counsel or proofs

<P>were not heard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thirdly, for that that concerns clerks and minis-

<P>ters.&nbsp; The place of justice is an hallowed place; and

<P>therefore not only the bench, but the foot-place;

<P>and precincts and purprise thereof, ought to be

<P>preserved without scandal and corruption.&nbsp; For

<P>certainly grapes (as the Scripture saith) will not

<P>be gathered of thorns or thistles; either can justice

<P>yield her fruit with sweetness, amongst the briars

<P>and brambles of catching and polling clerks, and

<P>ministers.&nbsp; The attendance of courts, is subject to

<P>four bad instruments.&nbsp; First, certain persons that

<P>are sowers of suits; which make the court swell,

<P>and the country pine.&nbsp; The second sort is of those,

<P>that engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction, and

<P>are not truly amici curiae, but parasiti curiae, in

<P>puffing a court up beyond her bounds, for their

<P>own scraps and advantage.&nbsp; The third sort, is of

<P>those that may be accounted the left hands of

<P>courts; persons that are full of nimble and sinister

<P>tricks and shifts, whereby they pervert the plain

<P>and direct courses of courts, and bring justice into

<P>oblique lines and labyrinths.&nbsp; And the fourth, is the

<P>poller and exacter of fees; which justifies the com-

<P>mon resemblance of the courts of justice, to the

<P>bush whereunto, while the sheep flies for defence

<P>in weather, he is sure to lose part of his fleece.&nbsp; On

<P>the other side, an ancient clerk, skilful in prece-

<P>dents, wary in proceeding, and understanding in

<P>the business of the court, is an excellent finger of

<P>a court; and doth many times point the way to the

<P>judge himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fourthly, for that which may concern the sov-

<P>ereign and estate.&nbsp; Judges ought above all to re-

<P>member the conclusion of the Roman Twelve

<P>Tables; Salus populi suprema lex; and to know

<P>that laws, except they be in order to that end, are

<P>but things captious, and oracles not well inspired.

<P>Therefore it is an happy thing in a state, when

<P>kings and states do often consult with judges; and

<P>again, when judges do often consult with the king

<P>and state: the one, when there is matter of law,

<P>intervenient in business of state; the other, when

<P>there is some consideration of state, intervenient

<P>in matter of law.&nbsp; For many times the things de-

<P>duced to judgment may be meum and tuum, when

<P>the reason and consequence thereof may trench to

<P>point of estate: I call matter of estate, not only the

<P>parts of sovereignty, but whatsoever introduceth

<P>any great alteration, or dangerous precedent; or

<P>concerneth manifestly any great portion of peo-

<P>ple.&nbsp; And let no man weakly conceive, that just

<P>laws and true policy have any antipathy; for they

<P>are like the spirits and sinews, that one moves with

<P>the other.&nbsp; Let judges also remember, that Solo-

<P>mon's throne was supported by lions on both sides:

<P>let them be lions, but yet lions under the throne;

<P>being circumspect that they do not check or oppose

<P>any points of sovereignty.&nbsp; Let not judges also be

<P>ignorant of their own right, as to think there is not

<P>left to them, as a principal part of their office, a

<P>wise use and application of laws.&nbsp; For they may

<P>remember, what the apostle saith of a greater law

<P>than theirs; Nos scimus quia lex bona est, modo

<P>quis ea utatur legitime.
