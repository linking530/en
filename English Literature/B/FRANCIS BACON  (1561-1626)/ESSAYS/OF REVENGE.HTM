<P>REVENGE is a kind of wild justice; which the

<P>more man' s nature runs to, the more ought

<P>law to weed it out.&nbsp; For as for the first wrong, it

<P>doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that

<P>wrong, putteth the law out of office.&nbsp; Certainly, in

<P>taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy;

<P>but in passing it over, he is superior; for it is a

<P>prince's part to pardon.&nbsp; And Solomon, I am sure,

<P>saith, It is the glory of a man, to pass by an offence.

<P>That which is past is gone, and irrevocable; and

<P>wise men have enough to do, with things present

<P>and to come; therefore they do but trifle with

<P>themselves, that labor in past matters.&nbsp; There is no

<P>man doth a wrong, for the wrong's sake; but

<P>thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or

<P>honor, or the like.&nbsp; Therefore why should I be

<P>angry with a man, for loving himself better than

<P>me? And if any man should do wrong, merely out

<P>of ill-nature, why, yet it is but like the thorn or

<P>briar, which prick and scratch, because they can

<P>do no other.&nbsp; The most tolerable sort of revenge, is

<P>for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy;

<P>but then let a man take heed, the revenge be such

<P>as there is no law to punish; else a man's enemy is

<P>still before hand, and it is two for one.&nbsp; Some, when

<P>they take revenge, are desirous, the party should

<P>know, whence it cometh.&nbsp; This is the more gener-

<P>ous.&nbsp; For the delight seemeth to be, not so much in

<P>doing the hurt, as in making the party repent.&nbsp; But

<P>base and crafty cowards, are like the arrow that

<P>flieth in the dark.&nbsp; Cosmus, duke of Florence, had a

<P>desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting

<P>friends, as if those wrongs were unpardonable;

<P>You shall read (saith he) that we are commanded

<P>to forgive our enemies; but you never read, that we

<P>are commanded to forgive our friends.&nbsp; But yet the

<P>spirit of Job was in a better tune: Shall we (saith

<P>he) take good at God's hands, and not be content to

<P>take evil also? And so of friends in a proportion.

<P>This is certain, that a man that studieth revenge,

<P>keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise

<P>would heal, and do well.&nbsp; Public revenges are for

<P>the most part fortunate; as that for the death of

<P>Caesar; for the death of Pertinax; for the death of

<P>Henry the Third of France; and many more.&nbsp; But

<P>in private revenges, it is not so.&nbsp; Nay rather, vindic-

<P>tive persons live the life of witches; who, as they

<P>are mischievous, so end they infortunate.
