<P>MANY ill matters and projects are under-

<P>taken; and private suits do putrefy the pub-

<P>lic good.&nbsp; Many good matters, are undertaken with

<P>bad minds; I mean not only corrupt minds, but

<P>crafty minds, that intend not performance.&nbsp; Some

<P>embrace suits, which never mean to deal effectu-

<P>ally in them; but if they see there may be life in

<P>the matter, by some other mean, they will be con-

<P>tent to win a thank, or take a second reward, or at

<P>least to make use, in the meantime, of the suitor's

<P>hopes.&nbsp; Some take hold of suits, only for an occa-

<P>sion to cross some other; or to make an informa-

<P>tion, whereof they could not otherwise have apt

<P>pretext; without care what become of the suit,

<P>when that turn is served; or, generally, to make

<P>other men's business a kind of entertainment, to

<P>bring in their own.&nbsp; Nay, some undertake suits,

<P>with a full purpose to let them fall; to the end to

<P>gratify the adverse party, or competitor.&nbsp; Surely

<P>there is in some sort a right in every suit; either a

<P>right of equity, if it be a suit of controversy; or a

<P>right of desert, if it be a suit of petition.&nbsp; If affection

<P>lead a man to favor the wrong side in justice, let

<P>him rather use his countenance to compound the

<P>matter, than to carry it.&nbsp; If affection lead a man

<P>to favor the less worthy in desert, let him do it,

<P>without depraving or disabling the better deserver.

<P>In suits which a man doth not well understand, it

<P>is good to refer them to some friend of trust and

<P>judgment, that may report, whether he may deal

<P>in them with honor: but let him choose well his

<P>referendaries, for else he may be led by the nose.

<P>Suitors are so distasted with delays and abuses,

<P>that plain dealing, in denying to deal in suits at

<P>first, and reporting the success barely, and in chal-

<P>lenging no more thanks than one hath deserved,

<P>is grown not only honorable, but also gracious.&nbsp; In

<P>suits of favor, the first coming ought to take little

<P>place: so far forth, consideration may be had of

<P>his trust, that if intelligence of the matter could

<P>not otherwise have been had, but by him, advan-

<P>tage be not taken of the note, but the party left to

<P>his other means; and in some sort recompensed,

<P>for his discovery.&nbsp; To be ignorant of the value of a

<P>suit, is simplicity; as well as to be ignorant of the

<P>right thereof, is want of conscience.&nbsp; Secrecy in

<P>suits, is a great mean of obtaining; for voicing

<P>them to be in forwardness, may discourage some

<P>kind of suitors, but doth quicken and awake others.

<P>But timing of the suit is the principal.&nbsp; Timing, I

<P>say, not only in respect of the person that should

<P>grant it, but in respect of those, which are like to

<P>cross it.&nbsp; Let a man, in the choice of his mean, rather

<P>choose the fittest mean, than the greatest mean;

<P>and rather them that deal in certain things, than

<P>those that are general.&nbsp; The reparation of a denial,

<P>is sometimes equal to the first grant; if a man

<P>show himself neither dejected nor discontented.

<P>Iniquum petas ut aequum feras is a good rule,

<P>where a man hath strength of favor: but other-

<P>wise, a man were better rise in his suit; for

<P>he, that would have ventured at first to have lost

<P>the suitor, will not in the conclusion lose both the

<P>suitor, and his own former favor.&nbsp; Nothing is

<P>thought so easy a request to a great person, as his

<P>letter; and yet, if it be not in a good cause, it is so

<P>much out of his reputation.&nbsp; There are no worse

<P>instruments, than these general contrivers of suits;

<P>for they are but a kind of poison, and infection, to

<P>public proceedings.
