<P>TO SEEK to extinguish anger utterly, is but a

<P>bravery of the Stoics.&nbsp; We have better oracles:

<P>Be angry, but sin not.&nbsp; Let not the sun go down

<P>upon your anger.&nbsp; Anger must be limited and con-

<P>fined, both in race and in time.&nbsp; We will first speak

<P>how the natural inclination and habit to be angry,

<P>may be attempted and calmed.&nbsp; Secondly, how the

<P>particular motions of anger may be repressed, or

<P>at least refrained from doing mischief.&nbsp; Thirdly,

<P>how to raise anger, or appease anger in another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the first; there is no other way but to medi-

<P>tate, and ruminate well upon the effects of anger,

<P>how it troubles man's life.&nbsp; And the best time to do

<P>this, is to look back upon anger, when the fit is

<P>thoroughly over.&nbsp; Seneca saith well, That anger is

<P>like ruin, which breaks itself upon that it falls.

<P>The Scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in

<P>patience.&nbsp; Whosoever is out of patience, is out of

<P>possession of his soul.&nbsp; Men must not turn bees;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>...&nbsp; animasque in vulnere ponunt.

<P>Anger is certainly a kind of baseness; as it ap-

<P>pears well in the weakness of those subjects in

<P>whom it reigns; children, women, old folks, sick

<P>folks.&nbsp; Only men must beware, that they carry

<P>their anger rather with scorn, than with fear; so

<P>that they may seem rather to be above the injury,

<P>than below it; which is a thing easily done, if a

<P>man will give law to himself in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the second point; the causes and motives of

<P>anger, are chiefly three.&nbsp; First, to be too sensible of

<P>hurt; for no man is angry, that feels not himself

<P>hurt; and therefore tender and delicate persons

<P>must needs be oft angry; they have so many things

<P>to trouble them, which more robust natures have

<P>little sense of.&nbsp; The next is, the apprehension and

<P>construction of the injury offered, to be, in the cir-

<P>cumstances thereof, full of contempt: for contempt

<P>is that, which putteth an edge upon anger, as much

<P>or more than the hurt itself.&nbsp; And therefore, when

<P>men are ingenious in picking out circumstances of

<P>contempt, they do kindle their anger much.&nbsp; Lastly,

<P>opinion of the touch of a man's reputation, doth

<P>multiply and sharpen anger.&nbsp; Wherein the remedy

<P>is, that a man should have, as Consalvo was wont

<P>to say, telam honoris crassiorem.&nbsp; But in all refrain-

<P>ings of anger, it is the best remedy to win time;

<P>and to make a man's self believe, that the oppor-

<P>tunity of his revenge is not yet come, but that he

<P>foresees a time for it; and so to still himself in the

<P>meantime, and reserve it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To contain anger from mischief, though it take

<P>hold of a man, there be two things, whereof you

<P>must have special caution.&nbsp; The one, of extreme bit-

<P>terness of words, especially if they be aculeate and

<P>proper; for cummunia maledicta are nothing so

<P>much; and again, that in anger a man reveal no

<P>secrets; for that, makes him not fit for society.&nbsp; The

<P>other, that you do not peremptorily break off, in

<P>any business, in a fit of anger; but howsoever you

<P>show bitterness, do not act anything, that is not

<P>revocable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For raising and appeasing anger in another; it

<P>is done chiefly by choosing of times, when men

<P>are frowardest and worst disposed, to incense

<P>them.&nbsp; Again, by gathering (as was touched before)

<P>all that you can find out, to aggravate the con-

<P>tempt.&nbsp; And the two remedies are by the contraries.

<P>The former to take good times, when first to relate

<P>to a man an angry business; for the first impres-

<P>sion is much; and the other is, to sever, as much as

<P>may be, the construction of the injury from the

<P>point of contempt; imputing it to misunderstand-

<P>ing, fear, passion, or what you will.
