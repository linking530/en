<P>TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of edu-

<P>cation, in the elder, a part of experience.&nbsp; He

<P>that travelleth into a country, before he hath some

<P>entrance into the language, goeth to school, and

<P>not to travel.&nbsp; That young men travel under some

<P>tutor, or grave servant, I allow well; so that he be

<P>such a one that hath the language, and hath been

<P>in the country before; whereby he may be able

<P>to tell them what things are worthy to be seen, in

<P>the country where they go; what acquaintances

<P>they are to seek; what exercises, or discipline, the

<P>place yieldeth.&nbsp; For else, young men shall go

<P>hooded, and look abroad little.&nbsp; It is a strange thing,

<P>that in sea voyages, where there is nothing to be

<P>seen, but sky and sea, men should make diaries;

<P>but in land-travel, wherein so much is to be ob-

<P>served, for the most part they omit it; as if chance

<P>were fitter to be registered, than observation.&nbsp; Let

<P>diaries, therefore, be brought in use.&nbsp; The things to

<P>be seen and observed are: the courts of princes,

<P>especially when they give audience to ambassa-

<P>dors; the courts of justice, while they sit and hear

<P>causes; and so of consistories ecclesiastic; the

<P>churches and monasteries, with the monuments

<P>which are therein extant; the walls and fortifica-

<P>tions of cities, and towns, and so the heavens and

<P>harbors; antiquities and ruins; libraries; colleges,

<P>disputations, and lectures, where any are; ship-

<P>ping and navies; houses and gardens of state and

<P>pleasure, near great cities; armories; arsenals;

<P>magazines; exchanges; burses; warehouses; exer-

<P>cises of horsemanship, fencing, training of sol-

<P>diers, and the like; comedies, such whereunto the

<P>better sort of persons do resort; treasuries of jewels

<P>and robes; cabinets and rarities; and, to conclude,

<P>whatsoever is memorable, in the places where

<P>they go.&nbsp; After all which, the tutors, or servants,

<P>ought to make diligent inquiry.&nbsp; As for triumphs,

<P>masks, feasts, weddings, funerals, capital execu-

<P>tions, and such shows, men need not to be put in

<P>mind of them; yet are they not to be neglected.&nbsp; If

<P>you will have a young man to put his travel into a

<P>little room, and in short time to gather much, this

<P>you must do.&nbsp; First, as was said, he must have some

<P>entrance into the language before he goeth.&nbsp; Then

<P>he must have such a servant, or tutor, as knoweth

<P>the country, as was likewise said.&nbsp; Let him carry

<P>with him also, some card or book, describing the

<P>country where he travelleth; which will be a good

<P>key to his inquiry.&nbsp; Let him keep also a diary.&nbsp; Let

<P>him not stay long, in one city or town; more or less

<P>as the place deserveth, but not long; nay, when he

<P>stayeth in one city or town, let him change his

<P>lodging from one end and part of the town, to an-

<P>other; which is a great adamant of acquaintance.

<P>Let him sequester himself, from the company of

<P>his countrymen, and diet in such places, where

<P>there is good company of the nation where he

<P>travelleth.&nbsp; Let him, upon his removes from one

<P>place to another, procure recommendation to some

<P>person of quality, residing in the place whither he

<P>removeth; that he may use his favor, in those

<P>things he desireth to see or know.&nbsp; Thus he may

<P>abridge his travel, with much profit.&nbsp; As for the

<P>acquaintance, which is to be sought in travel; that

<P>which is most of all profitable, is acquaintance

<P>with the secretaries and employed men of ambas-

<P>sadors: for so in travelling in one country, he shall

<P>suck the experience of many.&nbsp; Let him also see, and

<P>visit, eminent persons in all kinds, which are of

<P>great name abroad; that he may be able to tell,

<P>how the life agreeth with the fame.&nbsp; For quarrels,

<P>they are with care and discretion to be avoided.

<P>They are commonly for mistresses, healths, place,

<P>and words.&nbsp; And let a man beware,&nbsp; how he keepeth

<P>company with choleric and quarrelsome persons;

<P>for they will engage him into their own quarrels.

<P>When a traveller returneth home, let him not

<P>leave the countries, where he hath travelled, alto-

<P>gether behind him; but maintain a correspond-

<P>ence by letters, with those of his acquaintance,

<P>which are of most worth.&nbsp; And let his travel appear

<P>rather in his discourse, than his apparel or gesture;

<P>and in his discourse, let him be rather advised in

<P>his answers, than forward to tell stories; and let it

<P>appear that he doth not change his country man-

<P>ners, for those of foreign parts; but only prick in

<P>some flowers, of that he hath learned abroad, into

<P>the customs of his own country.
