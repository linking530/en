<P>THE speech of Themistocles the Athenian,

<P>which was haughty and arrogant, in taking

<P>so much to himself, had been a grave and wise

<P>observation and censure, applied at large to others.

<P>Desired at a feast to touch a lute, he said, He could

<P>not fiddle, but yet he could make a small town, a

<P>great city.&nbsp; These words (holpen a little with a

<P>metaphor) may express two differing abilities, in

<P>those that deal in business of estate.&nbsp; For if a true

<P>survey be taken of counsellors and statesmen,

<P>there may be found (though rarely) those which

<P>can make a small state great, and yet cannot fid-

<P>dle; as on the other side, there will be found a great

<P>many, that can fiddle very cunningly, but yet are

<P>so far from being able to make a small state great,

<P>as their gift lieth the other way; to bring a great

<P>and flourishing estate, to ruin and decay.&nbsp; And cer-

<P>tainly whose degenerate arts and shifts, whereby

<P>many counsellors and governors gain both favor

<P>with their masters, and estimation with the vulgar,

<P>deserve no better name than fiddling; being things

<P>rather pleasing for the time, and graceful to them-

<P>selves only, than tending to the weal and advance-

<P>ment of the state which they serve.&nbsp; There are also

<P>(no doubt) counsellors and governors which may

<P>be held sufficient (negotiis pares), able to manage

<P>affairs, and to keep them from precipices and

<P>manifest inconveniences; which nevertheless are

<P>far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate

<P>in power, means, and fortune.&nbsp; But be the workmen

<P>what they may be, let us speak of the work; that

<P>is, the true greatness of kingdoms and estates, and

<P>the means thereof.&nbsp; An argument fit for great and

<P>mighty princes to have in their hand; to the end

<P>that neither by over-measuring their forces, they

<P>leese themselves in vain enterprises; nor on the

<P>other side, by undervaluing them, they descend to

<P>fearful and pusillanimous counsels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The greatness of an estate, in bulk and territory,

<P>doth fall under measure; and the greatness of

<P>finances and revenue, doth fall under computa-

<P>tion.&nbsp; The population may appear by musters; and

<P>the number and greatness of cities and towns by

<P>cards and maps.&nbsp; But yet there is not any thing

<P>amongst civil affairs more subject to error, than

<P>the right valuation and true judgment concerning

<P>the power and forces of an estate.&nbsp; The kingdom of

<P>heaven is compared, not to any great kernel or nut,

<P>but to a grain of mustard-seed: which is one of the

<P>least grains, but hath in it a property and spirit

<P>hastily to get up and spread.&nbsp; So are there states,

<P>great in territory, and yet not apt to enlarge or

<P>command; and some that have but a small dimen-

<P>sion of stem, and yet apt to be the foundations of

<P>great monarchies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Walled towns, stored arsenals and armories,

<P>goodly races of horse, chariots of war, elephants,

<P>ordnance, artillery, and the like; all this is but a

<P>sheep in a lion's skin, except the breed and disposi-

<P>tion of the people, be stout and warlike.&nbsp; Nay, num-

<P>ber (itself) in armies importeth not much, where

<P>the people is of weak courage; for (as Virgil saith)

<P>It never troubles a wolf, how many the sheep be.

<P>The army of the Persians, in the plains of Arbela,

<P>was such a vast sea of people, as it did somewhat

<P>astonish the commanders in Alexander's army;

<P>who came to him therefore, and wished him to set

<P>upon them by night; and he answered, He would

<P>not pilfer the victory.&nbsp; And the defeat was easy.

<P>When Tigranes the Armenian, being encamped

<P>upon a hill with four hundred thousand men, dis-

<P>covered the army of the Romans, being not above

<P>fourteen thousand, marching towards him, he

<P>made himself merry with it, and said, Yonder men

<P>are too many for an embassage, and too few for a

<P>fight.&nbsp; But before the sun set, he found them enow

<P>to give him the chase with infinite slaughter.

<P>Many are the examples of the great odds, between

<P>number and courage; so that a man may truly

<P>make a judgment, that the principal point of great-

<P>ness in any state, is to have a race of military men.

<P>Neither is money the sinews of war (as it is trivially

<P>said), where the sinews of men's arms, in base and

<P>effeminate people, are failing.&nbsp; For Solon said well

<P>to Croesus (when in ostentation he showed him his

<P>gold), Sir, if any other come, that hath better iron,

<P>than you, he will be master of all this gold.&nbsp; There-

<P>fore let any prince or state think solely of his forces,

<P>except his militia of natives be of good and valiant

<P>soldiers.&nbsp; And let princes, on the other side, that

<P>have subjects of martial disposition, know their

<P>own strength; unless they be otherwise wanting

<P>unto themselves.&nbsp; As for mercenary forces (which

<P>is the help in this case), all examples show, that

<P>whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them,

<P>he may spread his feathers for a time, but he will

<P>mew them soon after.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blessing of Judah and Issachar will never

<P>meet; that the same people, or nation, should be

<P>both the lion's whelp and the ass between bur-

<P>thens; neither will it be, that a people overlaid

<P>with taxes, should ever become valiant and mar-

<P>tial.&nbsp; It is true that taxes levied by consent of the

<P>estate, do abate men's courage less: as it hath been

<P>seen notably, in the excises of the Low Countries;

<P>and, in some degree, in the subsidies of England.

<P>For you must note, that we speak now of the heart,

<P>and not of the purse.&nbsp; So that although the same

<P>tribute and tax, laid by consent or by imposing, be

<P>all one to the purse, yet it works diversely upon the

<P>courage.&nbsp; So that you may conclude, that no people

<P>overcharged with tribute, is fit for empire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Let states that aim at greatness, take heed how

<P>their nobility and gentlemen do multiply too fast.

<P>For that maketh the common subject, grow to be a

<P>peasant and base swain, driven out of heart, and in

<P>effect but the gentleman's laborer.&nbsp; Even as you

<P>may see in coppice woods; if you leave your stad-

<P>dles too thick, you shall never have clean under-

<P>wood, but shrubs and bushes.&nbsp; So in countries,&nbsp; if the

<P>gentlemen be too many, the commons will be base;

<P>and you will bring it to that, that not the hundred

<P>poll, will be fit for an helmet; especially as to the

<P>infantry, which is the nerve of an army; and so

<P>there will be great population, and little strength.

<P>This which I speak of, hath been nowhere better

<P>seen, than by comparing of England and France;

<P>whereof England, though far less in territory and

<P>population, hath been (nevertheless) an over-

<P>match; in regard the middle people of England

<P>make good soldiers, which the peasants of France

<P>do not.&nbsp; And herein the device of king Henry the

<P>Seventh (whereof I have spoken largely in the

<P>History of his Life) was profound and admirable;

<P>in making farms and houses of husbandry of a

<P>standard; that is, maintained with such a propor-

<P>tion of land unto them, as may breed a subject to

<P>live in convenient plenty and no servile condition;

<P>and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners,

<P>and not mere hirelings.&nbsp; And thus indeed you shall

<P>attain to Virgil's character which he gives to an-

<P>cient Italy:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Terra potens armis atque ubere glebae.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Neither is that state (which, for any thing I know,

<P>is almost peculiar to England, and hardly to be

<P>found anywhere else, except it be perhaps in

<P>Poland) to be passed over; I mean the state of free

<P>servants, and attendants upon noblemen and

<P>gentlemen; which are no ways inferior unto the

<P>yeomanry for arms.&nbsp; And therefore out of all ques-

<P>tions, the splendor and magnificence, and great

<P>retinues and hospitality, of noblemen and gentle-

<P>men, received into custom, doth much conduce

<P>unto martial greatness.&nbsp; Whereas, contrariwise, the

<P>close and reserved living of noblemen and gentle-

<P>men, causeth a penury of military forces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By all means it is to be procured, that the trunk

<P>of Nebuchadnezzar's tree of monarchy, be great

<P>enough to bear the branches and the boughs; that

<P>is, that the natural subjects of the crown or state,

<P>bear a sufficient proportion to the stranger sub-

<P>jects, that they govern.Therefore all states that are

<P>liberal of naturalization towards strangers, are fit

<P>for empire.&nbsp; For to think that an handful of people

<P>can, with the greatest courage and policy in the

<P>world, embrace too large extent of dominion, it

<P>may hold for a time, but it will fail suddenly.&nbsp; The

<P>Spartans were a nice people in point of naturaliza-

<P>tion; whereby, while they kept their compass,

<P>they stood firm; but when they did spread, and

<P>their boughs were becomen too great for their

<P>stem, they became a windfall, upon the sudden.

<P>Never any state was in this point so open to receive

<P>strangers into their body, as were the Romans.

<P>Therefore it sorted with them accordingly; for

<P>they grew to the greatest monarchy.&nbsp; Their manner

<P>was to grant naturalization (which they called jus

<P>civitatis), and to grant it in the highest degree; that

<P>is, not only jus commercii, jus connubii, jus haere-

<P>ditatis; but also jus suffragii, and jus honorum.

<P>And this not to singular persons alone, but likewise

<P>to whole families; yea to cities, and sometimes to

<P>nations.&nbsp; Add to this their custom of plantation of

<P>colonies; whereby the Roman plant was removed

<P>into the soil of other nations.&nbsp; And putting both

<P>constitutions together, you will say that it was not

<P>the Romans that spread upon the world, but it was

<P>the world that spread upon the Romans; and that

<P>was the sure way of greatness.&nbsp; I have marvelled,

<P>sometimes, at Spain, how they clasp and contain

<P>so large dominions, with so few natural Spaniards;

<P>but sure the whole compass of Spain, is a very great

<P>body of a tree; far above Rome and Sparta at the

<P>first.&nbsp; And besides, though they have not had that

<P>usage, to naturalize liberally, yet they have that

<P>which is next to it; that is, to employ, almost indif-

<P>ferently, all nations in their militia of ordinary

<P>soldiers; yea, and sometimes in their highest com-

<P>mands.&nbsp; Nay, it seemeth at this instant they are

<P>sensible, of this want of natives; as by the Prag-

<P>matical Sanction, now published, appeareth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is certain that sedentary, and within-door

<P>arts, and delicate manufactures (that require

<P>rather the finger than the arm), have, in their na-

<P>ture, a contrariety to a military disposition.&nbsp; And

<P>generally, all warlike people are a little idle, and

<P>love danger better than travail.&nbsp; Neither must they

<P>be too much broken of it, if they shall be preserved

<P>in vigor.&nbsp; Therefore it was great advantage, in the

<P>ancient states of Sparta, Athens, Rome, and others,

<P>that they had the use of slaves, which commonly

<P>did rid those manufactures.&nbsp; But that is abolished,

<P>in greatest part, by the Christian law.&nbsp; That which

<P>cometh nearest to it, is to leave those arts chiefly to

<P>strangers (which, for that purpose, are the more

<P>easily to be received), and to contain the principal

<P>bulk of the vulgar natives, within those three

<P>kinds, - tillers of the ground; free servants; and

<P>handicraftsmen of strong and manly arts, as

<P>smiths, masons, carpenters, etc.; not reckoning

<P>professed soldiers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But above all, for empire and greatness, it im-

<P>porteth most, that a nation do profess arms, as their

<P>principal honor, study, and occupation.&nbsp; For the

<P>things which we formerly have spoken of, are but

<P>habilitations towards arms; and what is habilita-

<P>tion without intention and act? Romulus, after his

<P>death (as they report or feign), sent a present to the

<P>Romans, that above all, they should intend arms;

<P>and then they should prove the greatest empire of

<P>the world.&nbsp; The fabric of the state of Sparta was

<P>wholly (though not wisely) framed and composed,

<P>to that scope and end.&nbsp; The Persians and Macedo-

<P>nians had it for a flash.&nbsp; The Gauls, Germans,

<P>Goths, Saxons, Normans, and others, had it for a

<P>time.&nbsp; The Turks have it at this day, though in great

<P>declination.&nbsp; Of Christian Europe, they that have it

<P>are, in effect, only the Spaniards.&nbsp; But it is so

<P>plain, that every man profiteth in that, he most

<P>intendeth, that it needeth not to be stood upon.&nbsp; It

<P>is enough to point at it; that no nation which doth

<P>not directly profess arms, may look to have great-

<P>ness fall into their mouths.&nbsp; And on the other side,

<P>it is a most certain oracle of time, that those states

<P>that continue long in that profession (as the Ro-

<P>mans and Turks principally have done) do won-

<P>ders.&nbsp; And those that have professed arms but for

<P>an age, have, notwithstanding, commonly at-

<P>tained that greatness, in that age, which main-

<P>tained them long after, when their profession and

<P>exercise of arms hath grown to decay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Incident to this point is, for a state to have those

<P>laws or customs, which may reach forth unto them

<P>just occasions (as may be pretended) of war.&nbsp; For

<P>there is that justice, imprinted in the nature of

<P>men, that they enter not upon wars (whereof so

<P>many calamities do ensue) but upon some, at the

<P>least specious, grounds and quarrels.&nbsp; The Turk

<P>hath at hand, for cause of war, the propagation of

<P>his law or sect; a quarrel that he may always com-

<P>mand.&nbsp; The Romans, though they esteemed the

<P>extending the limits of their empire, to be great

<P>honor to their generals, when it was done, yet they

<P>never rested upon that alone, to begin a war.&nbsp; First,

<P>therefore, let nations that pretend to greatness

<P>have this; that they be sensible of wrongs, either

<P>upon borderers, merchants, or politic ministers;

<P>and that they sit not too long upon a provocation.

<P>Secondly, let them be prest, and ready to give aids

<P>and succors, to their confederates; as it ever was

<P>with the Romans; insomuch, as if the confederate

<P>had leagues defensive, with divers other states,

<P>and, upon invasion offered, did implore their aids

<P>severally, yet the Romans would ever be the fore-

<P>most, and leave it to none other to have the honor.

<P>As for the wars which were anciently made, on

<P>the behalf of a kind of party, or tacit conformity of

<P>estate, I do not see how they may be well justified:

<P>as when the Romans made a war, for the liberty of

<P>Grecia; or when the Lacedaemonians and Athe-

<P>nians, made wars to set up or pull down democ-

<P>racies and oligarchies; or when wars were made

<P>by foreigners, under the pretence of justice or pro-

<P>tection, to deliver the subjects of others, from

<P>tyranny and oppression; and the like.&nbsp; Let it suf-

<P>fice, that no estate expect to be great, that is not

<P>awake upon any just occasion of arming.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No body can be healthful without exercise,

<P>neither natural body nor politic; and certainly to

<P>a kingdom or estate, a just and honorable war, is

<P>the true exercise.&nbsp; A civil war, indeed, is like the

<P>heat of a fever; but a foreign war is like the heat of

<P>exercise, and serveth to keep the body in health;

<P>for in a slothful peace, both courages will effemi-

<P>nate, and manners corrupt.&nbsp; But howsoever it be

<P>for happiness, without all question, for greatness,

<P>it maketh to be still for the most part in arms; and

<P>the strength of a veteran army (though it be a

<P>chargeable business) always on foot, is that which

<P>commonly giveth the law, or at least the reputa-

<P>tion, amongst all neighbor states; as may well be

<P>seen in Spain, which hath had, in one part or other,

<P>a veteran army almost continually, now by the

<P>space of six score years.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To be master of the sea, is an abridgment of a

<P>monarchy.&nbsp; Cicero, writing to Atticus of Pompey

<P>his preparation against Caesar, saith, Consilium

<P>Pompeii plane Themistocleum est; putat enim,

<P>qui mari potitur, eum rerum potiri.&nbsp; And, without

<P>doubt, Pompey had tired out Caesar, if upon vain

<P>confidence, he had not left that way.&nbsp; We see the

<P>great effects of battles bv sea.&nbsp; The battle of Actium,

<P>decided the empire of the world.&nbsp; The battle of Le-

<P>panto, arrested the greatness of the Turk.&nbsp; There be

<P>many examples, where sea-fights have been final

<P>to the war; but this is when princes or states have

<P>set up their rest, upon the battles.&nbsp; But thus much

<P>is certain, that he that commands the sea, is at

<P>great liberty, and may take as much, and as little,

<P>of the war as he will.&nbsp; Whereas those that be strong-

<P>est by land, are many times nevertheless in great

<P>straits.&nbsp; Surely, at this day, with us of Europe, the

<P>vantage of strength at sea (which is one of the prin-

<P>cipal dowries of this kingdom of Great Britain) is

<P>great; both because most of the kingdoms of Eu-

<P>rope, are not merely inland, but girt with the sea

<P>most part of their compass; and because the wealth

<P>of both Indies seems in great part, but an accessory

<P>to the command of the seas.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wars of latter ages seem to be made in the

<P>dark, in respect of the glory, and honor, which

<P>reflected upon men from the wars, in ancient time.

<P>There be now, for martial encouragement, some

<P>degrees and orders of chivalry; which nevertheless

<P>are conferred promiscuously, upon soldiers and

<P>no soldiers; and some remembrance perhaps, upon

<P>the scutcheon; and some hospitals for maimed sol-

<P>diers; and such like things.&nbsp; But in ancient times,

<P>the trophies erected upon the place of the victory;

<P>the funeral laudatives and monuments for those

<P>that died in the wars; the crowns and garlands per-

<P>sonal; the style of emperor, which the great kings

<P>of the world after borrowed; the triumphs of the

<P>generals, upon their return; the great donatives

<P>and largesses, upon the disbanding of the armies;

<P>were things able to inflame all men's courages.

<P>But above all, that of the triumph, amongst the

<P>Romans, was not pageants or gaudery, but one of

<P>the wisest and noblest institutions, that ever was.

<P>For it contained three things: honor to the general;

<P>riches to the treasury out of the spoils; and dona-

<P>tives to the army.&nbsp; But that honor, perhaps were not

<P>fit for monarchies; except it be in the person of the

<P>monarch himself, or his sons; as it came to pass in

<P>the times of the Roman emperors, who did impro-

<P>priate the actual triumphs to themselves, and their

<P>sons, for such wars as they did achieve in person;

<P>and left only, for wars achieved by subjects, some

<P>triumphal garments and ensigns to the general.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To conclude: no man can by care taking (as the

<P>Scripture saith) add a cubit to his stature, in this

<P>little model of a man's body; but in the great frame

<P>of kingdoms and commonwealths, it is in the

<P>power of princes or estates, to add amplitude and

<P>greatness to their kingdoms; for by introducing

<P>such ordinances, constitutions, and customs, as we

<P>have now touched, they may sow greatness to

<P>their posterity and succession.&nbsp; But these things are

<P>commonly not observed, but left to take their

<P>chance.
