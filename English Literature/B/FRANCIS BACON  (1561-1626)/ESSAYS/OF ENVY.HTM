<P>THERE be none of the affections, which have

<P>been noted to fascinate or bewitch, but love

<P>and envy.&nbsp; They both have vehement wishes; they

<P>frame themselves readily into imaginations and

<P>suggestions; and they come easily into the eye,

<P>especially upon the present of the objects; which

<P>are the points that conduce to fascination, if any

<P>such thing there be.&nbsp; We see likewise, the Scripture

<P>calleth envy an evil eye; and the astrologers, call

<P>the evil influences of the stars, evil aspects; so that

<P>still there seemeth to be acknowledged, in the act

<P>of envy, an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye.

<P>Nay, some have been so curious, as to note, that

<P>the times when the stroke or percussion of an envi-

<P>ous eye doth most hurt, are when the party envied

<P>is beheld in glory or triumph; for that sets an edge

<P>upon envy: and besides, at such times the spirits

<P>of the person envied, do come forth most into the

<P>outward parts, and so meet the blow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But leaving these curiosities (though not un-

<P>worthy to be thought on, in fit place), we will

<P>handle, what persons are apt to envy others; what

<P>persons are most subject to be envied themselves;

<P>and what is the difference between public and

<P>private envy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever en-

<P>vieth virtue in others.&nbsp; For men's minds, will either

<P>feed upon their own good, or upon others' evil; and

<P>who wanteth the one, will prey upon the other;

<P>and whoso is out of hope, to attain to another's

<P>virtue, will seek to come at even hand, by depress-

<P>ing another's fortune.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A man that is busy, and inquisitive, is com-

<P>monly envious.&nbsp; For to know much of other men's

<P>matters, cannot be because all that ado may con-

<P>cern his own estate; therefore it must needs be,

<P>that he taketh a kind of play-pleasure, in looking

<P>upon the fortunes of others.&nbsp; Neither can he, that

<P>mindeth but his own business, find much matter

<P>for envy.&nbsp; For envy is a gadding passion, and walk-

<P>eth the streets, and doth not keep home: Non est

<P>curiosus, quin idem sit malevolus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Men of noble birth, are noted to be envious

<P>towards new men, when they rise.&nbsp; For the distance

<P>is altered, and it is like a deceit of the eye, that

<P>when others come on, they think themselves, go

<P>back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Deformed persons, and eunuchs, and old men,

<P>and bastards, are envious.&nbsp; For he that cannot pos-

<P>sibly mend his own case, will do what he can, to

<P>impair another's; except these defects light upon

<P>a very brave, and heroical nature, which thinketh

<P>to make his natural wants part of his honor; in that

<P>it should be said, that an eunuch, or a lame man,

<P>did such great matters; affecting the honor of a

<P>miracle; as it was in Narses the eunuch, and Agesi-

<P>laus and Tamberlanes, that were lame men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The same is the case of men, that rise after ca-

<P>lamities and misfortunes.&nbsp; For they are as men

<P>fallen out with the times; and think other men's

<P>harms, a redemption of their own sufferings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They that desire to excel in too many matters,

<P>out of levity and vain glory, are ever envious.&nbsp; For

<P>they cannot want work; it being impossible, but

<P>many, in some one of those things, should surpass

<P>them.&nbsp; Which was the character of Adrian the Em-

<P>peror; that mortally envied poets, and painters,

<P>and artificers, in works wherein he had a vein to

<P>excel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lastly, near kinsfolks, and fellows in office, and

<P>those that have been bred together, are more apt

<P>to envy their equals, when they are raised.&nbsp; For it

<P>doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes, and

<P>pointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their

<P>remembrance, and incurreth likewise more into

<P>the note of others; and envy ever redoubleth from

<P>speech and fame.&nbsp; Cain's envy was the more vile

<P>and malignant, towards his brother Abel, because

<P>when his sacrifice was better accepted, there was

<P>no body to look on.&nbsp; Thus much for those, that are

<P>apt to envy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Concerning those that are more or less subject

<P>to envy: First, persons of eminent virtue, when

<P>they are advanced, are less envied.&nbsp; For their for-

<P>tune seemeth , but due unto them; and no man

<P>envieth the payment of a debt, but rewards and

<P>liberality rather.&nbsp; Again, envy is ever joined with

<P>the comparing of a man's self; and where there is

<P>no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are

<P>not envied, but by kings.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is to be

<P>noted, that unworthy persons are most envied, at

<P>their first coming in, and afterwards overcome it

<P>better; whereas contrariwise, persons of worth

<P>and merit are most envied, when their fortune

<P>continueth long.&nbsp; For by that time, though their

<P>virtue be the same, yet it hath not the same lustre;

<P>for fresh men grow up that darken it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Persons of noble blood, are less envied in their

<P>rising.&nbsp; For it seemeth but right done to their birth.

<P>Besides, there seemeth not much added to their

<P>fortune; and envy is as the sunbeams, that beat

<P>hotter upon a bank, or steep rising ground, than

<P>upon a flat.&nbsp; And for the same reason, those that are

<P>advanced by degrees, are less envied than those

<P>that are advanced suddenly and per saltum.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Those that have joined with their honor great

<P>travels, cares, or perils, are less subject to envy.

<P>For men think that they earn their honors hardly,

<P>and pity them sometimes; and pity ever healeth

<P>envy.&nbsp; Wherefore you shall observe, that the more

<P>deep and sober sort of politic persons, in their

<P>greataess, are ever bemoaning themselves, what

<P>a life they lead; chanting a quanta patimur! Not

<P>that they feel it so, but only to abate the edge of

<P>envy.&nbsp; But this is to be understood, of business that

<P>is laid upon men, and not such, as they call unto

<P>themselves.&nbsp; For nothing increaseth envy more,

<P>than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of

<P>business.&nbsp; And nothing doth extinguish envy more,

<P>than for a great person to preserve all other infe-

<P>rior officers, in their full lights and pre-eminences

<P>of their places.&nbsp; For by that means, there be so

<P>many screens between him and envy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Above all, those are most subject to envy, which

<P>carry the greatness of their fortunes, in an insolent

<P>and proud manner; being never well, but while

<P>they are showing how great they are, either by

<P>outward pomp, or by triumphing over all opposi-

<P>tion or competition; whereas wise men will rather

<P>do sacrifice to envy, in suffering themselves some-

<P>times of purpose to be crossed, and overborne in

<P>things that do not much concern them.&nbsp; Notwith-

<P>standing, so much is true, that the carriage of

<P>greatness, in a plain and open manner (so it be

<P>without arrogancy and vain glory) doth draw less

<P>envy, than if it be in a more crafty and cunning

<P>fashion.&nbsp; For in that course, a man doth but dis-

<P>avow fortune; and seemeth to be conscious of his

<P>own want in worth; and doth but teach others, to

<P>envy him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lastly, to conclude this part; as we said in the

<P>beginning, that the act of envy had somewhat in

<P>it of witchcraft, so there is no other cure of envy,

<P>but the cure of witchcraft; and that is, to remove

<P>the lot (as they call it) and to lay it upon another.

<P>For which purpose, the wiser sort of great persons,

<P>bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom

<P>to derive the envy, that would come upon them-

<P>selves; sometimes upon ministers and servants;

<P>sometimes upon colleagues and associates; and the

<P>like; and for that turn there are never wanting,

<P>some persons of violent and undertaking natures,

<P>who, so they may have power and business, will

<P>take it at any cost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, to speak of public envy.&nbsp; There is yet some

<P>good in public envy, whereas in private, there is

<P>none.&nbsp; For public envy, is as an ostracism, that

<P>eclipseth men, when they grow too great.&nbsp; And

<P>therefore it is a bridle also to great ones, to keep

<P>them within bounds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This envy, being in the Latin word invidia,

<P>goeth in the modern language, by the name of

<P>discontentment; of which we shall speak, in hand-

<P>ling sedition.&nbsp; It is a disease, in a state, like to infec-

<P>tion.&nbsp; For as infection spreadeth upon that which is

<P>sound, and tainteth it; so when envy is gotten once

<P>into a state, it traduceth even the best actions

<P>thereof, and turneth them into an ill odor.&nbsp; And

<P>therefore there is little won, by intermingling of

<P>plausible actions.&nbsp; For that doth argue but a weak-

<P>ness, and fear of envy, which hurteth so much the

<P>more, as it is likewise usual in infections; which

<P>if you fear them, you call them upon you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This public envy, seemeth to beat chiefly upon

<P>principal officers or ministers, rather than upon

<P>kings, and estates themselves.&nbsp; But this is a sure

<P>rule, that if the envy upon the minister be great,

<P>when the cause of it in him is small; or if the envy

<P>be general, in a manner upon all the ministers of

<P>an estate; then the envy (though hidden) is truly

<P>upon the state itself.&nbsp; And so much of public envy

<P>or discontentment, and the difference thereof from

<P>private envy, which was handled in the first place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We will add this in general, touching the affec-

<P>tion of envy; that of all other affections, it is the

<P>most importune and continual.&nbsp; For of other affec-

<P>tions, there is occasion given, but now and then;

<P>and therefore it was well said, Invidia festos dies

<P>non agit: for it is ever working upon some or other.

<P>And it is also noted, that love and envy do make a

<P>man pine, which other affections do not, because

<P>they are not so continual.&nbsp; It is also the vilest affec-

<P>tion, and the most depraved; for which cause it

<P>is the proper attribute of the devil, who is called,

<P>the envious man, that soweth tares amongst the

<P>wheat by night; as it always cometh to pass, that

<P>envy worketh subtilly, and in the dark, and to the

<P>prejudice of good things, such as is the wheat.
