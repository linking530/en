<P>AMBITION is like choler; which is an humor

<P>that maketh men active, earnest, full of alac-

<P>rity, and stirring, if it be not stopped.&nbsp; But if it be

<P>stopped, and cannot have his way, it becometh

<P>adust, and thereby malign and venomous.&nbsp; So am-

<P>bitious men, if they find the way open for their

<P>rising, and still get forward, they are rather busy

<P>than dangerous; but if they be checked in their

<P>desires, they become secretly discontent, and look

<P>upon men and matters with an evil eye, and are

<P>best pleased, when things go backward; which is

<P>the worst property in a servant of a prince, or state.

<P>Therefore it is good for princes, if they use ambi-

<P>tious men, to handle it, so as they be still progres-

<P>sive and not retrograde; which, because it cannot

<P>be without inconvenience, it is good not to use such

<P>natures at all.&nbsp; For if they rise not with their service,

<P>they will take order, to make their service fall with

<P>them.&nbsp; But since we have said, it were good not to

<P>use men of ambitious natures, except it be upon

<P>necessity, it is fit we speak, in what cases they are

<P>of necessity.&nbsp; Good commanders in the wars must

<P>be taken, be they never so ambitious; for the use

<P>of their service, dispenseth with the rest; and to

<P>take a soldier without ambition, is to pull off his

<P>spurs.&nbsp; There is also great use of ambitious men, in

<P>being screens to princes in matters of danger and

<P>envy; for no man will take that part, except he be

<P>like a seeled dove, that mounts and mounts, be-

<P>cause he cannot see about him.&nbsp; There is use also of

<P>ambitious men, in pulling down the greatness of

<P>any subject that overtops; as Tiberius used Marco,

<P>in the pulling down of Sejanus.&nbsp; Since, therefore,

<P>they must be used in such cases, there resteth to

<P>speak, how they are to be bridled, that they may be

<P>less dangerous.&nbsp; There is less danger of them, if they

<P>be of mean birth, than if they be noble; and if they

<P>be rather harsh of nature, than gracious and popu-

<P>lar: and if they be rather new raised, than grown

<P>cunning, and fortified, in their greatness.&nbsp; It is

<P>counted by some, a weakness in princes, to have

<P>favorites; but it is, of all others, the best remedy

<P>against ambitious great-ones.&nbsp; For when the way

<P>of pleasuring, and displeasuring, lieth by the

<P>favorite, it is impossible any other should be over-

<P>great.&nbsp; Another means to curb them, is to balance

<P>them by others, as proud as they.&nbsp; But then there

<P>must be some middle counsellors, to keep things

<P>steady; for without that ballast, the ship will roll

<P>too much.&nbsp; At the least, a prince may animate

<P>and inure some meaner persons, to be as it were

<P>scourges, to ambitions men.&nbsp; As for the having of

<P>them obnoxious to ruin; if they be of fearful

<P>natures, it may do well; but if they be stout and

<P>daring, it may precipitate their designs, and prove

<P>dangerous.&nbsp; As for the pulling of them down, if the

<P>affairs require it, and that it may not be done with

<P>safety suddenly, the only way is the interchange,

<P>continually, of favors and disgraces; whereby

<P>they may not know what to expect, and be, as it

<P>were, in a wood.&nbsp; Of ambitions, it is less harmful,

<P>the ambition to prevail in great things, than that

<P>other, to appear in every thing; for that breeds

<P>confusion, and mars business.&nbsp; But yet it is less dan-

<P>ger, to have an ambitious man stirring in business,

<P>than great in dependences.&nbsp; He that seeketh to be

<P>eminent amongst able men, hath a great task; but

<P>that is ever good for the public.&nbsp; But he, that plots

<P>to be the only figure amongst ciphers, is the decay

<P>of a whole age.&nbsp; Honor hath three things in it: the

<P>vantage ground to do good; the approach to kings

<P>and principal persons; and the raising of a man's

<P>own fortunes.&nbsp; He that hath the best of these inten-

<P>tions, when he aspireth, is an honest man; and that

<P>prince, that can discern of these intentions in an-

<P>other that aspireth, is a wise prince.&nbsp; Generally, let

<P>princes and states choose such ministers, as are

<P>more sensible of duty than of using; and such as

<P>love business rather upon conscience, than upon

<P>bravery, and let them discern a busy nature, from

<P>a willing mind.
