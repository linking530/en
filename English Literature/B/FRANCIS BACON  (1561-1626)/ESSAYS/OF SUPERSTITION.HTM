<P>IT WERE better to have no opinion of God at all,

<P>than such an opinion, as is unworthy of him.

<P>For the one is unbelief, the other is contumely;

<P>and certainly superstition is the reproach of the

<P>Deity.&nbsp; Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Surely

<P>(saith he) I had rather a great deal, men should

<P>say, there was no such man at all, as Plutarch,

<P>than that they should say, that there was one Plu-

<P>tarch, that would eat his children as soon as they

<P>were born; as the poets speak of Saturn.&nbsp; And as the

<P>contumely is greater towards God, so the danger is

<P>greater towards men.&nbsp; Atheism leaves a man to

<P>sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to

<P>reputation; all which may be guides to an outward

<P>moral virtue, though religion were not; but super-

<P>stition dismounts all these, and erecteth an abso-

<P>lute monarchy, in the minds of men.&nbsp; Therefore

<P>theism did never perturb states; for it makes men

<P>wary of themselves, as looking no further: and we

<P>see the times inclined to atheism (as the time of

<P>Augustus Caesar) were civil times.&nbsp; But supersti-

<P>tion hath been the confusion of many states, and

<P>bringeth in a new primum mobile, that ravisheth

<P>all the spheres of government.The master of super-

<P>stition, is the people; and in all superstition, wise

<P>men follow fools; and arguments are fitted to prac-

<P>tice, in a reversed order.&nbsp; It was gravely said by

<P>some of the prelates in the Council of Trent, where

<P>the doctrine of the Schoolmen bare great sway,

<P>that the Schoolmen were like astronomers, which

<P>did feign eccentrics and epicycles, and such en-

<P>gines of orbs, to save the phenomena; though they

<P>knew there were no such things; and in like man-

<P>ner, that the Schoolmen had framed a number of

<P>subtle and intricate axioms, and theorems, to save

<P>the practice of the church.&nbsp; The causes of supersti-

<P>tion are: pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies;

<P>excess of outward and pharisaical holiness; over-

<P>great reverence of traditions, which cannot but

<P>load the church; the stratagems of prelates, for

<P>their own ambition and lucre; the favoring too

<P>much of good intentions, which openeth the gate

<P>to conceits and novelties; the taking an aim at

<P>divine matters, by human, which cannot but

<P>breed mixture of imaginations: and, lastly, bar-

<P>barous times, especially joined with calamities

<P>and disasters.&nbsp; Superstition, without a veil, is a de-

<P>formed thing; for, as it addeth deformity to an

<P>ape, to be so like a man, so the similitude of super-

<P>stition to religion, makes it the more deformed.

<P>And as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms,

<P>so good forms and orders corrupt, into a number of

<P>petty observances.&nbsp; There is a superstition in avoid-

<P>ing superstition, when men think to do best, if they

<P>go furthest from the superstition, formerly re-

<P>ceived; therefore care would be had that (as it

<P>fareth in ill purgings) the good be not taken away

<P>with the bad; which commonly is done, when the

<P>people is the reformer.
