<P>IT WAS prettily devised of AEsop, The fly sat

<P>upon the axle-tree of the chariot wheel, and

<P>said, What a dust do I raise! So are there some vain

<P>persons, that whatsoever goeth alone, or moveth

<P>upon greater means, if they have never so little

<P>hand in it, they think it is they that carry it.&nbsp; They

<P>that are glorious, must needs be factious; for all

<P>bravery stands upon comparisons.&nbsp; They must

<P>needs be violent, to make good their own vaunts.

<P>Neither can they be secret, and therefore not ef-

<P>fectual; but according to the French proverb,

<P>Beaucoup de bruit, peu de fruit; Much bruit little

<P>fruit.&nbsp; Yet certainly, there is use of this quality in

<P>civil affairs.&nbsp; Where there is an opinion and fame to

<P>be created, either of virtue or greatness, these men

<P>are good trumpeters.&nbsp; Again, as Titus Livius noteth,

<P>in the case of Antiochus and the AEtolians, There

<P>are sometimes great effects, of cross lies; as if a

<P>man, that negotiates between two princes, to draw

<P>them to join in a war against the third, doth extol

<P>the forces of either of them, above measure, the

<P>one to the other: and sometimes he that deals be-

<P>tween man and man, raiseth his own credit with

<P>both, by pretending greater interest than he hath

<P>in either.&nbsp; And in these and the like kinds, it often

<P>falls out, that somewhat is produced of nothing;

<P>for lies are sufficient to breed opinion, and opinion

<P>brings on substance.&nbsp; In militar commanders and

<P>soldiers, vain-glory is an essential point; for as

<P>iron sharpens iron, so by glory, one courage sharp-

<P>eneth another.&nbsp; In cases of great enterprise upon

<P>charge and adventure, a composition of glorious

<P>natures, doth put life into business; and those that

<P>are of solid and sober natures, have more of the

<P>ballast, than of the sail.&nbsp; In fame of learning, the

<P>flight will be slow without some feathers of osten-

<P>tation.&nbsp; Qui de contemnenda gloria libros scri-

<P>bunt, nomen, suum inscribunt.&nbsp; Socrates, Aristotle,

<P>Galen, were men full of ostentation.&nbsp; Certainly

<P>vain-glory helpeth to perpetuate a man's memory;

<P>and virtue was never so beholding to human na-

<P>ture, as it received his due at the second hand.

<P>Neither had the fame of Cicero, Seneca, Plinius

<P>Secundus, borne her age so well, if it had not been

<P>joined with some vanity in themselves; like unto

<P>varnish, that makes ceilings not only shine but

<P>last.&nbsp; But all this while, when I speak of vain-glory,

<P>I mean not of that property, that Tacitus doth at-

<P>tribute to Mucianus; Omnium quae dixerat fece-

<P>ratque arte quadam ostentator: for that proceeds

<P>not of vanity, but of natural magnanimity and

<P>discretion; and in some persons, is not only comely,

<P>but gracious.&nbsp; For excusations, cessions, modesty

<P>itself well governed, are but arts of ostentation.

<P>And amongst those arts, there is none better than

<P>that which Plinius Secundus speaketh of, which is

<P>to be liberal of praise and commendation to others,

<P>in that, wherein a man's self hath any perfection.

<P>For saith Pliny, very wittily, In commending

<P>another, you do yourself right; for he that you

<P>commend, is either superior to you in that you

<P>commend, or inferior.&nbsp; If he be inferior, if he be to

<P>be commended, you much more; if he be superior,

<P>if he be not to be commended, you much less.

<P>Glorious men are the scorn of wise men, the ad-

<P>miration of fools, the idols of parasites, and the

<P>slaves of their own vaunts.
