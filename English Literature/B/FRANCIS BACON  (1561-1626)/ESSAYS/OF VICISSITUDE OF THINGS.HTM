<P>SOLOMON saith, There is no new thing upon

<P>the earth.&nbsp; So that as Plato had an imagination,

<P>That all knowledge was but remembrance; so

<P>Solomon giveth his sentence, That all novelty is

<P>but oblivion.&nbsp; Whereby you may see, that the river

<P>of Lethe runneth as well above ground as below.

<P>There is an abstruse astrologer that saith, If it were

<P>not for two things that are constant (the one is,

<P>that the fixed stars ever stand a like distance one

<P>from another, and never come nearer together, nor

<P>go further asunder; the other, that the diurnal

<P>motion perpetually keepeth time), no individual

<P>would last one moment.&nbsp; Certain it is, that the mat-

<P>ter is in a perpetual flux, and never at a stay.&nbsp; The

<P>great winding-sheets, that bury all things in ob-

<P>livion, are two; deluges and earthquakes.&nbsp; As for

<P>conflagrations and great droughts, they do not

<P>merely dispeople and destroy.&nbsp; Phaeton's car went

<P>but a day.&nbsp; And the three years' drought in the time

<P>of Elias, was but particular, and left people alive.

<P>As for the great burnings by lightnings, which are

<P>often in the West Indies, they are but narrow.&nbsp; But

<P>in the other two destructions, by deluge and earth-

<P>quake, it is further to be noted, that the remnant

<P>of people which hap to be reserved, are commonly

<P>ignorant and mountainous people, that can give

<P>no account of the time past; so that the oblivion is

<P>all one, as if none had been left.&nbsp; If you consider

<P>well of the people of the West Indies, it is very

<P>probable that they are a newer or a younger peo-

<P>ple, than the people of the Old World.&nbsp; And it is

<P>much more likely, that the destruction that hath

<P>heretofore been there, was not by earthquakes (as

<P>the Egyptian priest told Solon concerning the

<P>island of Atlantis, that it was swallowed by an

<P>earthquake), but rather that it was desolated by a

<P>particular deluge.&nbsp; For earthquakes are seldom in

<P>those parts.&nbsp; But on the other side, they have such

<P>pouring rivers, as the rivers of Asia and Africk and

<P>Europe, are but brooks to them.&nbsp; Their Andes, like-

<P>wise, or mountains, are far higher than those with

<P>us; whereby it seems, that the remnants of gen-

<P>eration of men, were in such a particular deluge

<P>saved.&nbsp; As for the observation that Machiavel hath,

<P>that the jealousy of sects, doth much extinguish

<P>the memory of things; traducing Gregory the

<P>Great, that he did what in him lay, to extinguish

<P>all heathen antiquities; I do not find that those

<P>zeals do any great effects, nor last long; as it ap-

<P>peared in the succession of Sabinian, who did

<P>revive the former antiquities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The vicissitude of mutations in the superior

<P>globe, are no fit matter for this present argument.

<P>It may be, Plato's great year, if the world should

<P>last so long, would have some effect; not in renew-

<P>ing the state of like individuals (for that is the fume

<P>of those, that conceive the celestial bodies have

<P>more accurate influences upon these things below,

<P>than indeed they have), but in gross.&nbsp; Comets, out

<P>of question, have likewise power and effect, over

<P>the gross and mass of things; but they are rather

<P>gazed upon, and waited upon in their journey,

<P>than wisely observed in their effects; specially in,

<P>their respective effects; that is, what kind of comet,

<P>for magnitude, color, version of the beams, plac-

<P>ing in the reign of heaven, or lasting, produceth

<P>what kind of effects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There is a toy which I have heard, and I would

<P>not have it given over, but waited upon a little.

<P>They say it is observed in the Low Countries (I

<P>know not in what part) that every five and thirty

<P>years, the same kind and suit of years and weath-

<P>ers come about again; as great frosts, great wet,

<P>great droughts, warm winters, summers with little

<P>heat, and the like; and they call it the Prime.&nbsp; It is

<P>a thing I do the rather mention, because, comput-

<P>ing backwards, I have found some concurrence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But to leave these points of nature, and to come

<P>to men.&nbsp; The greatest vicissitude of things amongst

<P>men, is the vicissitude of sects and religions.&nbsp; For

<P>those orbs rule in men's minds most.&nbsp; The true re-

<P>ligion is built upon the rock; the rest are tossed,

<P>upon the waves of time.&nbsp; To speak, therefore, of the

<P>causes of new sects; and to give some counsel con-

<P>cerning them, as far as the weakness of human

<P>judgment can give stay, to so great revolutions.

<P>When the religion formerly received, is rent by

<P>discords; and when the holiness of the professors

<P>of religion, is decayed and full of scandal; and

<P>withal the times be stupid, ignorant, and bar-

<P>barous; you may doubt the springing up of a new

<P>sect; if then also, there should arise any extrava-

<P>gant and strange spirit, to make himself author

<P>thereof.&nbsp; All which points held, when Mahomet

<P>published his law.&nbsp; If a new sect have not two prop-

<P>erties, fear it not; for it will not spread.&nbsp; The one is

<P>the supplanting, or the opposing, of authority es-

<P>tablished; for nothing is more popular than that.

<P>The other is the giving license to pleasures, and a

<P>voluptuous life.&nbsp; For as for speculative heresies

<P>(such as were in ancient times the Arians, and now

<P>the Armenians), though they work mightily upon

<P>men's wits, yet they do not produce any great al-

<P>terations in states; except it be by the help of civil

<P>occasions.&nbsp; There be three manner of plantations of

<P>new sects.&nbsp; By the power of signs and miracles; by

<P>the eloquence, and wisdom, of speech and persua-

<P>sion; and by the sword.&nbsp; For martyrdoms, I reckon

<P>them amongst miracles; because they seem to ex-

<P>ceed the strength of human nature: and I may do

<P>the like, of superlative and admirable holiness of

<P>life.&nbsp; Surely there is no better way, to stop the rising

<P>of new sects and schisms, than to reform abuses; to

<P>compound the smaller differences; to proceed

<P>mildly, and not with sanguinary persecutions;

<P>and rather to take off the principal authors by win-

<P>ning and advancing them, than to enrage them

<P>by violence and bitterness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The changes and vicissitude in wars are many;

<P>but chiefly in three things; in the seats or stages of

<P>the war; in the weapons; and in the manner of the

<P>conduct.&nbsp; Wars, in ancient time, seemed more to

<P>move from east to west; for the Persians, Assyrians,

<P>Arabians, Tartars (which were the invaders) were

<P>all eastern people.&nbsp; It is true, the Gauls were west-

<P>ern; but we read but of two incursions of theirs:

<P>the one to Gallo-Grecia, the other to Rome.&nbsp; But east

<P>and west have no certain points of heaven; and no

<P>more have the wars, either from the east or west,

<P>any certainty of observation.&nbsp; But north and south

<P>are fixed; and it hath seldom or never been seen

<P>that the far southern people have invaded the

<P>northern, but contrariwise.&nbsp; Whereby it is manifest

<P>that the northern tract of the world, is in nature

<P>the more martial region: be it in respect of the stars

<P>of that hemisphere; or of the great continents that

<P>are upon the north, whereas the south part, for

<P>aught that is known, is almost all sea; or (which is

<P>most apparent) of the cold of the northern parts,

<P>which is that which, without aid of discipline,

<P>doth make the bodies hardest, and the courages

<P>warmest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon the breaking and shivering of a great state

<P>and empire, you may be sure to have wars.&nbsp; For

<P>great empires, while they stand, do enervate and

<P>destroy the forces of the natives which they have

<P>subdued, resting upon their own protecting forces;

<P>and then when they fail also, all goes to ruin, and

<P>they become a prey.&nbsp; So was it in the decay of the

<P>Roman empire; and likewise in the empire of

<P>Almaigne, after Charles the Great, every bird tak-

<P>ing a feather; and were not unlike to befall to

<P>Spain, if it should break.&nbsp; The great accessions and

<P>unions of kingdoms, do likewise stir up wars; for

<P>when a state grows to an over-power, it is like a

<P>great flood, that will be sure to overflow.&nbsp; As it hath

<P>been seen in the states of Rome, Turkey, Spain,

<P>and others.&nbsp; Look when the world hath fewest bar-

<P>barous peoples, but such as commonly will not

<P>marry or generate, except they know means to live

<P>(as it is almost everywhere at this day, except Tar-

<P>tary), there is no danger of inundations of people;

<P>but when there be great shoals of people, which go

<P>on to populate, without foreseeing means of life

<P>and sustentation, it is of necessity that once in an

<P>age or two, they discharge a portion of their people

<P>upon other nations; which the ancient northern

<P>people were wont to do by lot; casting lots what

<P>part should stay at home, and what should seek

<P>their fortunes.&nbsp; When a warlike state grows soft and

<P>effeminate, they may be sure of a war.&nbsp; For com-

<P>monly such states are grownm rich in the time of

<P>their degenerating; and so the prey inviteth, and

<P>their decay in valor, encourageth a war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for the weapons, it hardly falleth under rule

<P>and observation: yet we see even they, have re-

<P>turns and vicissitudes.&nbsp; For certain it is, that ord-

<P>nance was known in the city of the Oxidrakes in

<P>India; and was that, which the Macedonians

<P>called thunder and lightning, and magic.&nbsp; And it

<P>is well known that the use of ordnance, hath been

<P>in China above two thousand years.&nbsp; The conditions

<P>of weapons, and their improvement, are; First, the

<P>fetching afar off; for that outruns the danger; as

<P>it is seen in ordnance and muskets.&nbsp; Secondly, the

<P>strength of the percussion; wherein likewise ord-

<P>nance do exceed all arietations and ancient inven-

<P>tions.&nbsp; The third is, the commodious use of them; as

<P>that they may serve in all weathers; that the car-

<P>riage may be light and manageable; and the like.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the conduct of the war: at the first, men

<P>rested extremely upon number: they did put the

<P>wars likewise upon main force and valor; pointing

<P>days for pitched fields, and so trying it out upon

<P>an even match and they were more ignorant in

<P>ranging and arraying their battles.&nbsp; After, they

<P>grew to rest upon number rather competent, than

<P>vast; they grew to advantages of place, cunning

<P>diversions, and the like: and they grew more skil-

<P>ful in the ordering of their battles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the youth of a state, arms do flourish; in the

<P>middle age of a state, learning; and then both of

<P>them together for a time; in the declining age of a

<P>state, mechanical arts and merchandize.&nbsp; Learning

<P>hath his infancy, when it is but beginning and

<P>almost childish; then his youth, when it is luxuri-

<P>ant and juvenile; then his strength of years, when

<P>it is solid and reduced; and lastly, his old age, when

<P>it waxeth dry and exhaust.&nbsp; But it is not good to look

<P>too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude,

<P>lest we become giddy.&nbsp; As for the philology of

<P>them, that is but a circle of tales, and therefore not

<P>fit for this writing.
