<P>THE joys of parents are secret; and so are their

<P>griefs and fears.&nbsp; They cannot utter the one;

<P>nor they will not utter the other.&nbsp; Children sweeten

<P>labors; but they make misfortunes more bitter.

<P>They increase the cares of life; but they mitigate

<P>the remembrance of death.&nbsp; The perpetuity by

<P>generation is common to beasts; but memory,

<P>merit, and noble works, are proper to men.&nbsp; And

<P>surely a man shall see the noblest works and foun-

<P>dations have proceeded from childless men; which

<P>have sought to express the images of their minds,

<P>where those of their bodies have failed.&nbsp; So the care

<P>of posterity is most in them, that have no posterity.

<P>They that are the first raisers of their houses, are

<P>most indulgent towards their children; beholding

<P>them as the continuance, not only of their kind, but

<P>of their work; and so both children and creatures.

<P>The difference in affection, of parents towards

<P>their several children, is many times unequal; and

<P>sometimes unworthy; especially in the mothers;

<P>as Solomon saith, A wise son rejoiceth the father,

<P>but an ungracious son shames the mother.&nbsp; A man

<P>shall see, where there is a house full of children,

<P>one or two of the eldest respected, and the young-

<P>est made wantons; but in the midst, some that

<P>are as it were forgotten, who many times, never-

<P>theless, prove the best.&nbsp; The illiberality of parents,

<P>in allowance towards their children, is an harmful

<P>error; makes them base; acquaints them with

<P>shifts; makes them sort with mean company; and

<P>makes them surfeit more when they come to

<P>plenty.&nbsp; And therefore the proof is best, when men

<P>keep their authority towards the children, but not

<P>their purse.&nbsp; Men have a foolish manner (both par-

<P>ents and schoolmasters and servants) in creating

<P>and breeding an emulation between brothers, dur-

<P>ing childhood, which many times sorteth to dis-

<P>cord when they are men, and disturbeth families.

<P>The Italians make little difference between chil-

<P>dren, and nephews or near kinsfolks; but so they

<P>be of the lump, they care not though they pass not

<P>through their own body.&nbsp; And, to say truth, in

<P>nature it is much a like matter; insomuch that we

<P>see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle, or

<P>a kinsman, more than his own parent; as the blood

<P>happens.&nbsp; Let parents choose betimes, the vocations

<P>and courses they mean their children should take;

<P>for then they are most flexible; and let them not

<P>too much apply themselves to the disposition of

<P>their children, as thinking they will take best to

<P>that, which they have most mind to.&nbsp; It is true, that

<P>if the affection or aptness of the children be extra-

<P>ordinary, then it is good not to cross it; but gener-

<P>ally the precept is good, optimum elige, suave et

<P>facile illud faciet consuetudo.&nbsp; Younger brothers

<P>are commonly fortunate, but seldom or never

<P>where the elder are disinherited.
