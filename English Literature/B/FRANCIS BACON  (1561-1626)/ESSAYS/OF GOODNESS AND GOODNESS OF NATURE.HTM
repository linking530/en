<P>I TAKE goodness in this sense, the affecting of

<P>the weal of men, which is that the Grecians

<P>call philanthropia; and the word humanity (as

<P>it is used) is a little too light to express it.&nbsp; Good-

<P>ness I call the habit, and goodness of nature, the

<P>inclination.&nbsp; This of all virtues, and dignities of the

<P>mind, is the greatest; being the character of the

<P>Deity: and without it, man is a busy, mischievous,

<P>wretched thing; no better than a kind of vermin.

<P>Goodness answers to the theological virtue, char-

<P>ity, and admits no excess, but error.&nbsp; The desire of

<P>power in excess, caused the angels to fall; the desire

<P>of knowledge in excess, caused man to fall: but in

<P>charity there is no excess; neither can angel, nor

<P>man, come in dan ger by it.&nbsp; The inclination to good-

<P>ness, is imprinted deeply in the nature of man; in-

<P>somuch, that if it issue not towards men, it will

<P>take unto other living creatures; as it is seen in the

<P>Turks, a cruel people, who nevertheless are kind

<P>to beasts, and give alms, to dogs and birds; inso-

<P>much, as Busbechius reporteth, a Christian boy, in

<P>Constantinople, had like to have been stoned, for

<P>gagging in a waggishness a long-billed fowl.

<P>Errors indeed in this virtue of goodness, or charity,

<P>may be committed.&nbsp; The Italians have an ungra-

<P>cious proverb, Tanto buon che val niente: so

<P>good, that he is good for nothing.&nbsp; And one of

<P>the doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel, had

<P>the confidence to put in writing, almost in plain

<P>terms, That the Christian faith, had given up good

<P>men, in prey to those that are tyrannical and un-

<P>just.&nbsp; Which he spake, because indeed there was

<P>never law, or sect, or opinion, did so much mag-

<P>nify goodness, as the Christian religion doth.

<P>Therefore, to avoid the scandal and the danger

<P>both, it is good, to take knowledge of the errors of

<P>an habit so excellent.&nbsp; Seek the good of other men,

<P>but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies; for

<P>that is but facility, or softness; which taketh an

<P>honest mind prisoner.&nbsp; Neither give thou AEsop's

<P>cock a gem, who would be better pleased, and hap-

<P>pier, if he had had a barley-corn.&nbsp; The example of

<P>God, teacheth the lesson truly: He sendeth his rain,

<P>and maketh his sun to shine, upon the just and

<P>unjust; but he doth not rain wealth, nor shine

<P>honor and virtues, upon men equally.&nbsp; Common

<P>benefits, are to be communicate with all; but pe-

<P>culiar benefits, with choice.&nbsp; And beware how in

<P>making the portraiture, thou breakest the pattern.

<P>For divinity, maketh the love of ourselves the pat-

<P>tern; the love of our neighbors, but the portraiture.

<P>Sell all thou hast, and give it to the poor, and fol-

<P>low me: but, sell not all thou hast, except thou

<P>come and follow me; that is, except thou have a

<P>vocation, wherein thou mayest do as much good,

<P>with little means as with great; for otherwise, in

<P>feeding the streams, thou driest the fountain.

<P>Neither is there only a habit of goodness, directed

<P>by right reason; but there is in some men, even in

<P>nature, a disposition towards it; as on the other

<P>side, there is a natural malignity.&nbsp; For there be,

<P>that in their nature do not affect the good of others.

<P>The lighter sort of malignity, turneth but to a

<P>crassness, or frowardness, or aptness to oppose, or

<P>difficulties, or the like; but the deeper sort, to envy

<P>and mere mischief.&nbsp; Such men, in other men's ca-

<P>lamities, are, as it were, in season, and are ever on

<P>the loading part: not so good as the dogs, that licked

<P>Lazarus' sores; but like flies, that are still buzzing

<P>upon any thing that is raw; misanthropi, that

<P>make it their practice, to bring men to the bough,

<P>and yet never a tree for the purpose in their gar-

<P>dens, as Timon had.&nbsp; Such dispositions, are the very

<P>errors of human nature; and yet they are the fittest

<P>timber, to make great politics of; like to knee tim-

<P>ber, that is good for ships, that are ordained to be

<P>tossed; but not for building houses, that shall stand

<P>firm.&nbsp; The parts and signs of goodness, are many.&nbsp; If

<P>a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it

<P>shows he is a citizen of the world, and that his heart

<P>is no island, cut off from other lands, but a conti-

<P>nent, that joins to them.&nbsp; If he be compassionate

<P>towards the afflictions of others, it shows that his

<P>heart is like the noble tree, that is wounded itself,

<P>when it gives the balm.&nbsp; If he easily pardons, and

<P>remits offences, it shows that his mind is planted

<P>above injuries; so that he cannot be shot.&nbsp; If he be

<P>thankful for small benefits, it shows that he weighs

<P>men's minds, and not their trash.&nbsp; But above all, if

<P>he have St. Paul's perfection, that he would wish

<P>to be anathema from Christ, for the salvation of

<P>his brethren, it shows much of a divine nature, and

<P>a kind of conformity with Christ himself.
