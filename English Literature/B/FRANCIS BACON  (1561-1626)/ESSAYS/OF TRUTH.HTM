<P>WHAT is truth? said jesting Pilate,and would

<P>not stay for an answer.&nbsp; Certainly there be,

<P>that delight in giddiness, and count it a bondage to

<P>fix a belief; affecting free-will in thinking, as well

<P>as in acting.&nbsp; And though the sects of philosophers

<P>of that kind be gone, yet there remain certain dis-

<P>coursing wits, which are of the same veins, though

<P>there be not so much blood in them, as was in those

<P>of the ancients.&nbsp; But it is not only the difficulty and

<P>labor, which men take in finding out of truth, nor

<P>again, that when it is found, it imposeth upon

<P>men's thoughts, that doth bring lies in favor; but

<P>a natural, though corrupt love, of the lie itself.&nbsp; One

<P>of the later school of the Grecians, examineth the

<P>matter, and is at a stand, to think what should be

<P>in it, that men should love lies; where neither they

<P>make for pleasure, as with poets, nor for advan-

<P>tage, as with the merchant; but for the lie's sake.

<P>But I cannot tell; this same truth, is a naked, and

<P>open day-light, that doth not show the masks, and

<P>mummeries, and triumphs, of the world, half so

<P>stately and daintily as candle-lights.&nbsp; Truth may

<P>perhaps come to the price of a pearl, that showeth

<P>best by day; but it will not rise to the price of a

<P>diamond, or carbuncle, that showeth best in varied

<P>lights.&nbsp; A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure.

<P>Doth any man doubt, that if there were taken out

<P>of men's minds, vain opinions, flattering hopes,

<P>false valuations, imaginations as one would, and

<P>the like, but it would leave the minds, of a number

<P>of men, poor shrunken things, full of melancholy

<P>and indisposition, and unpleasing to themselves?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of the fathers, in great severity, called poesy

<P>vinum daemonum, because it fireth the imagina-

<P>tion; and yet, it is but with the shadow of a lie.

<P>But it is not the lie that passeth through the mind,

<P>but the lie that sinketh in, and settleth in it, that

<P>doth the hurt; such as we spake of before.&nbsp; But how-

<P>soever these things are thus in men's depraved

<P>judgments, and affections, yet truth, which only

<P>doth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of truth,

<P>which is the love-making, or wooing of it, the

<P>knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and

<P>the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is

<P>the sovereign good of human nature.&nbsp; The first

<P>creature of God, in the works of the days, was the

<P>light of the sense; the last, was the light of reason;

<P>and his sabbath work ever since, is the illumina-

<P>tion of his Spirit.&nbsp; First he breathed light, upon the

<P>face of the matter or chaos; then he breathed light,

<P>into the face of man; and still he breatheth and in-

<P>spireth light, into the face of his chosen.&nbsp; The poet,

<P>that beautified the sect, that was otherwise in-

<P>ferior to the rest, saith yet excellently well: It is a

<P>pleasure, to stand upon the shore, and to see ships

<P>tossed upon the sea; a pleasure, to stand in the win-

<P>dow of a castle, and to see a battle, and the adven-

<P>tures thereof below: but no pleasure is comparable

<P>to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth

<P>(a hill not to be commanded, and where the air is

<P>always clear and serene), and to see the errors, and

<P>wanderings, and mists, and tempests, in the vale

<P>below; so always that this prospect be with pity,

<P>and not with swelling, or pride.&nbsp; Certainly, it is

<P>heaven upon earth, to have a man's mind move in

<P>charity, rest in providence, and turn upon the

<P>poles of truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To pass from theological, and philosophical

<P>truth, to the truth of civil business; it will be ac-

<P>knowledged, even by those that practise it not, that

<P>clear, and round dealing, is the honor of man's

<P>nature; and that mixture of falsehoods, is like alloy

<P>in coin of gold and silver, which may make the

<P>metal work the better, but it embaseth it.&nbsp; For these

<P>winding, and crooked courses, are the goings of the

<P>serpent; which goeth basely upon the belly, and

<P>not upon the feet.&nbsp; There is no vice, that doth so

<P>cover a man with shame, as to be found false and

<P>perfidious.&nbsp; And therefore Montaigne saith pret-

<P>tily, when he inquired the reason, why the word

<P>of the lie should be such a disgrace, and such an

<P>odious charge? Saith he, If it be well weighed, to

<P>say that a man lieth, is as much to say, as that he is

<P>brave towards God, and a coward towards men.

<P>For a lie faces God, and shrinks from man.&nbsp; Surely

<P>the wickedness of falsehood, and breach of faith,

<P>cannot possibly be so highly expressed, as in that

<P>it shall be the last peal, to call the judgments of God

<P>upon the generations of men; it being foretold,

<P>that when Christ cometh, he shall not find faith

<P>upon the earth.
