<P>THE winning of honor, is but the revealing of

<P>a man,s virtue and worth, without disadvan-

<P>tage.&nbsp; For some in their actions, do woo and effect

<P>honor and reputation, which sort of men, are

<P>commonly much talked of, but inwardly little

<P>admired.&nbsp; And some, contrariwise, darken their

<P>virtue in the show of it; so as they be undervalued

<P>in opinion.&nbsp; If a man perform that, which hath not

<P>been attempted before; or attempted and given

<P>over; or hath been achieved, but not with so good

<P>circumstance; he shall purchase more honor, than

<P>by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue,

<P>wherein he is but a follower.&nbsp; If a man so temper

<P>his actions, as in some one of them he doth content

<P>every faction, or combination of people, the music

<P>will be the fuller.&nbsp; A man is an ill husband of bis

<P>honor, that entereth into any action, the failing

<P>wherein may disgrace him, more than the carry-

<P>ing of it through, can honor him.&nbsp; Honor that is

<P>gained and broken upon another, hath the quick-

<P>est reflection, like diamonds cut with facets.&nbsp; And

<P>therefore, let a man contend to excel any competi-

<P>tors of his in honor, in outshooting them, if he can,

<P>in their own bow.&nbsp; Discreet followers and servants,

<P>help much to reputation.&nbsp; Omnis fama a domesticis

<P>emanat.&nbsp; Envy, which is the canker of honor, is

<P>best extinguished by declaring a man's self in

<P>his ends, rather to seek merit than fame; and by

<P>attributing a man's successes, rather to divine

<P>Providence and felicity, than to his own virtue or

<P>policy.

<P>The true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign

<P>honor, are these: In the first place are conditores

<P>imperiorum, founders of states and common-

<P>wealths; such as were Romulus, Cyrus, Caesar,

<P>Ottoman, Ismael.&nbsp; In the second place are legis-

<P>latores, lawgivers; which are also called second

<P>founders, or perpetui principes, because they gov-

<P>ern by their ordinances after they are gone; such

<P>were Lycurgus, Solon, Justinian, Eadgar, Alphon-

<P>sus of Castile, the Wise, that made the Siete Parti-

<P>das.&nbsp; In the third place are liberatores, or salvatores,

<P>such as compound the long miseries of civil

<P>wars, or deliver their countries from servitude of

<P>strangers or tyrants; as Augustus Caesar, Vespasi-

<P>anus, Aurelianus, Theodoricus, King Henry the

<P>Seventh of England, King Henry the Fourth of

<P>France.&nbsp; In the fourth place are propagatores or

<P>propugnatores imperii; such as in honorable wars

<P>enlarge their territories, or make noble defence

<P>against invaders.&nbsp; And in the last place are patres

<P>patriae; which reign justly, and make the times

<P>good wherein they live.&nbsp; Both which last kinds need

<P>no examples, they are in such number.&nbsp; Degrees of

<P>honor, in subjects, are, first participes curarum,

<P>those upon whom, princes do discharge the great-

<P>est weight of their affairs; their right hands, as

<P>we call them.&nbsp; The next are duces belli, great leaders

<P>in war; such as are princes' lieutenants, and do

<P>them notable services in the wars.&nbsp; The third are

<P>gratiosi, favorites; such as exceed not this scant-

<P>ling, to be solace to the sovereign, and harmless to

<P>the people.&nbsp; And the fourth, negotiis pares; such as

<P>have great places under princes, and execute their

<P>places, with sufficiency.&nbsp; There is an honor, like-

<P>wise, which may be ranked amongst the greatest,

<P>which happeneth rarely; that is, of such as sacri-

<P>fice themselves to death or danger for the good of

<P>their country; as was M. Regulus, and the two

<P>Decii.
