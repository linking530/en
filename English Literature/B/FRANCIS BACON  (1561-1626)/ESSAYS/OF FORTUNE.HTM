<P>IT CANNOT be denied, but outward accidents

<P>conduce much to fortune; favor, opportunity,

<P>death of others, occasion fitting virtue.&nbsp; But chiefly,

<P>the mould of a man's fortune is in his own hands.

<P>Faber quisque fortunae suae, saith the poet.&nbsp; And

<P>the most frequent of external causes is, that the

<P>folly of one man, is the fortune of another.&nbsp; For no

<P>man prospers so suddenly, as by others' errors.

<P>Serpens nisi serpentem comederit non fit draco.

<P>Overt and apparent virtues, bring forth praise; but

<P>there be secret and hidden virtues, that bring forth

<P>fortune; certain deliveries of a man's self, which

<P>have no name.&nbsp; The Spanish name, desemboltura,

<P>partly expresseth them; when there be not stonds

<P>nor restiveness in a man's nature; but that the

<P>wheels of his mind, keep way with the wheels of

<P>his fortune.&nbsp; For so Livy (after he had described

<P>Cato Major in these words, In illo viro tantum ro-

<P>bur corporis et animi fuit, ut quocunque loco natus

<P>esset, fortunam sibi facturus videretur) falleth

<P>upon that, that he had versatile ingenium.&nbsp; There-

<P>fore if a man look sharply and attentively, he shall

<P>see Fortune: for though she be blind, yet she is not

<P>invisible.&nbsp; The way of fortune, is like the Milken

<P>Way in the sky; which is a meeting or knot of a

<P>number of small stars; not seen asunder, but giv-

<P>ing light together.&nbsp; So are there a number of

<P>little, and scarce discerned virtues, or rather facul-

<P>ties and customs, that make men fortunate.&nbsp; The

<P>Italians note some of them, such as a man would

<P>little think.&nbsp; When they speak of one that cannot do

<P>amiss, they will throw in, into his other conditions,

<P>that he hath Poco di matto.&nbsp; And certainly there be

<P>not two more fortunate properties, than to have a

<P>little of the fool, and not too much of the honest.

<P>Therefore extreme lovers of their country or

<P>masters, were never fortunate, neither can they

<P>be. For when a man placeth his thoughts without

<P>himself, he goeth not his own way.&nbsp; An hasty for-

<P>tune maketh an enterpriser and remover (the

<P>French hath it better, entreprenant, or remuant);

<P>but the exercised fortune maketh the able man.

<P>Fortune is to be honored and respected, and it be

<P>but for her daughters, Confidence and Reputation.

<P>For those two, Felicity breedeth; the first within

<P>a man's self, the latter in others towards him.&nbsp; All

<P>wise men, to decline the envy of their own virtues,

<P>use to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune; for

<P>so they may the better assume them: and, besides,

<P>it is greatness in a man, to be the care of the higher

<P>powers.&nbsp; So Caesar said to the pilot in the tempest,

<P>Caesarem portas, et fortunam ejus.&nbsp; So Sylla chose

<P>the name of Felix, and not of Magnus.&nbsp; And it hath

<P>been noted, that those who ascribe openly too

<P>much to their own wisdom and policy, end infor-

<P>tunate.&nbsp; It is written that Timotheus the Athenian,

<P>after he had, in the account he gave to the state of

<P>his government, often interlaced this speech, and

<P>in this, Fortune had no part, never prospered in

<P>anything, he undertook afterwards.&nbsp; Certainly

<P>there be, whose fortunes are like Homer's verses,

<P>that have a slide and easiness more than the verses

<P>of other poets; as Plutarch saith of Timoleon's for-

<P>tune, in respect of that of Agesilaus or Epaminon-

<P>das.&nbsp; And that this shoulld be, no doubt it is much,

<P>in a man's self.
