<P>THE stage is more beholding to love, than the

<P>life of man.&nbsp; For as to the stage, love is ever

<P>matter of comedies, and now and then of tragedies;

<P>but in life it doth much mischief; sometimes like a

<P>siren, sometimes like a fury.&nbsp; You may observe, that

<P>amongst all the great and worthy persons (whereof

<P>the memory remaineth, either ancient or recent)

<P>there is not one, that hath been transported to

<P>the mad degree of love: which shows that great

<P>spirits, and great business, do keep out this weak

<P>passion.&nbsp; You must except, nevertheless, Marcus

<P>Antonius, the half partner of the empire of Rome,

<P>and Appius Claudius, the decemvir and lawgiver;

<P>whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man,

<P>and inordinate; but the latter was an austere and

<P>wise man: and therefore it seems (though rarely)

<P>that love can find entrance, not only into an open

<P>heart, but also into a heart well fortified, if watch

<P>be not well kept.&nbsp; It is a poor saying of Epicurus,

<P>Satis&nbsp; magnum&nbsp; alter&nbsp; alteri&nbsp; theatrum&nbsp; sumus;&nbsp;
as&nbsp;&nbsp; if

<P>man,&nbsp; made&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; contemplation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;
heaven,&nbsp;&nbsp; and

<P>all noble objects, should do nothing but kneel be-

<P>fore a little idol, and make himself a subject,

<P>though not of the mouth (as beasts are), yet of the

<P>eye; which was given him for higher purposes.&nbsp; It

<P>is a strange thing, to note the excess of this passion,

<P>and how it braves the nature, and value of things,

<P>by this; that the speaking in a perpetual hyper-

<P>bole, is comely in nothing but in love.&nbsp; Neither is it

<P>merely in the phrase; for whereas it hath been

<P>well said, that the arch-flatterer, with whom all

<P>the petty flatterers have intelligence, is a man's

<P>self; certainly the lover is more.&nbsp; For there was

<P>never proud man thought so absurdly well of him-

<P>self, as the lover doth of the person loved; and

<P>therefore it was well said, That it is impossible to

<P>love, and to be wise.&nbsp; Neither doth this weakness

<P>appear to others only, and not to the party loved;

<P>but to the loved most of all, except the love be reci-

<P>proque.&nbsp; For it is a true rule, that love is ever re-

<P>warded, either with the reciproque, or with an

<P>inward and secret contempt.&nbsp; By how much the

<P>more, men ought to beware of this passion, which

<P>loseth not only other things, but itself! As for the

<P>other losses, the poet's relation doth well figure

<P>them: that he that preferred Helena, quitted the

<P>gifts of Juno and Pallas.&nbsp; For whosoever esteemeth

<P>too much of amorous affection, quitteth both riches

<P>and wisdom.&nbsp; This passion hath his floods, in very

<P>times of weakness; which are great prosperity, and

<P>great adversity; though this latter hath been less

<P>observed: both which times kindle love, and make

<P>it more fervent, and therefore show it to be the

<P>child of folly.&nbsp; They do best, who if they cannot but

<P>admit love, yet make it keep quarters; and sever it

<P>wholly from their serious affairs, and actions, of

<P>life; for if it check once with business, it troubleth

<P>men's fortunes, and maketh men, that they can no

<P>ways be true to their own ends.&nbsp; I know not how,

<P>but martial men are given to love: I think, it is but

<P>as they are given to wine; for perils commonly ask

<P>to be paid in pleasures.&nbsp; There is in man's nature, a

<P>secret inclination and motion, towards love of

<P>others, which if it be not spent upon some one or a

<P>few, doth naturally spread itself towards many,

<P>and maketh men become humane and charitable;

<P>as it is seen sometime in friars.&nbsp; Nuptial love maketh

<P>mankind; friendly love perfecteth it; but wanton

<P>love corrupteth, and embaseth it.
