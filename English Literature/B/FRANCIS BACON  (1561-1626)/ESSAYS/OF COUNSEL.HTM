<BR>THE greatest trust, between man and man, is

<P>the trust of giving counsel.&nbsp; For in other con-

<P>fidences, men commit the parts of life; their lands,

<P>their goods, their children, their credit, some par-

<P>ticular affair; but to such as they make their coun-

<P>sellors, they commit the whole: by how much the

<P>more, they are obliged to all faith and integrity.

<P>The wisest princes need not think it any diminu-

<P>tion to their greatness, or derogation to their suf-

<P>ficiency, to rely upon counsel.&nbsp; God himself is not

<P>without, but hath made it one of the great names

<P>of his blessed Son: The Counsellor.&nbsp; Solomon hath

<P>pronounced, that in counsel is stability.&nbsp; Things

<P>will have their first, or second agitation: if they be

<P>not tossed upon the arguments of counsel, they

<P>will be tossed upon the waves of fortune; and be

<P>full of inconstancy, doing and undoing, like the

<P>reeling of a drunken man.&nbsp; Solomon's son found

<P>the force of counsel, as his father saw the necessity

<P>of it.&nbsp; For the beloved kingdom of God, was first

<P>rent, and broken, by ill counsel; upon which coun-

<P>sel, there are set for our instruction, the two marks

<P>whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned;

<P>that it was young counsel, for the person; and

<P>violent counsel, for the matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ancient times, do set forth in figure, both

<P>the incorporation, and inseparable conjunction, of

<P>counsel with kings, and the wise and politic use of

<P>counsel by kings: the one, in that they say Jupi-

<P>ter did marry Metis, which signifieth counsel;

<P>whereby they intend that Sovereignty, is married

<P>to Counsel: the other in that which followeth,

<P>which was thus: They say, after Jupiter was mar-

<P>ried to Metis, she conceived by him, and was with

<P>child, but Jupiter suffered her not to stay, till she

<P>brought forth, but eat her up; whereby he became

<P>himself with child, and was delivered of Pallas

<P>armed, out of his head.&nbsp; Which monstrous fable

<P>containeth a secret of empire; how kings are to

<P>make use of their counsel of state.&nbsp; That first, they

<P>ought to refer matters unto them, which is the first

<P>begetting, or impregnation; but when they are

<P>elaborate, moulded, and shaped in the womb of

<P>their counsel, and grow ripe, and ready to be

<P>brought forth, that then they suffer not their coun-

<P>sel to go through with the resolution and direc-

<P>tion, as if it depended on them; but take the matter

<P>back into their own hands, and make it appear to

<P>the world, that the decrees and final directions

<P>(which, because they come forth, with prudence

<P>and power, are resembled to Pallas armed) pro-

<P>ceeded from themselves; and not only from their

<P>authority, but (the more to add reputation to them-

<P>selves) from their head and device.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Let us now speak of the inconveniences of coun-

<P>sel, and of the remedies.&nbsp; The inconveniences that

<P>have been noted, in calling and using counsel, are

<P>three.&nbsp; First, the revealing of affairs, whereby they

<P>become less secret.&nbsp; Secondly, the weakening of the

<P>authority of princes, as if they were less of them-

<P>selves.&nbsp; Thirdly, the danger of being unfaithfully

<P>counselled, and more for the good of them that

<P>counsel, than of him that is counselled.&nbsp; For which

<P>inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice

<P>of France, in some kings' times, hath introduced

<P>cabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to secrecy; princes are not bound to commu-

<P>nicate all matters, with all counsellors; but may

<P>extract and select.&nbsp; Neither is it necessary, that he

<P>that consulteth what he should do, should declare

<P>what he will do.&nbsp; But let princes beware, that the

<P>unsecreting of their affairs, comes not from them-

<P>selves.&nbsp; And as for cabinet counsels, it may be their

<P>motto, plenus rimarum sum: one futile person,

<P>that maketh it his glory to tell, will do more hurt

<P>than many, that know it their duty to conceal.&nbsp; It is

<P>true there be some affairs, which require extreme

<P>secrecy, which will hardly go beyond one or two

<P>persons, besides the king: neither are those coun-

<P>sels unprosperous; for, besides the secrecy, they

<P>conunonly go on constantly, in one spirit of direc-

<P>tion, without distraction.&nbsp; But then it must be a

<P>prudent king, such as is able to grind with a hand-

<P>mill; and those inward counsellors had need also

<P>be wise men, and especially true and trusty to the

<P>king's ends; as it was with King Henry the Seventh

<P>of England, who, in his great business, imparted

<P>himself to none, except it were to Morton and Fox.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For weakening of authority; the fable showeth

<P>the remedy.&nbsp; Nay, the majesty of kings, is rather

<P>exalted than diminished, when they are in the

<P>chair of counsel; neither was there ever prince, be-

<P>reaved of his dependences, by his counsel, except

<P>where there hath been, either an over-greatness

<P>in one counsellor, or an over-strict combination in

<P>divers; which are things soon found, and holpen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the last inconvenience, that men will coun-

<P>sel, with an eye to themselves; certainly, non

<P>inveniet fidem super terram is meant, of the na-

<P>ture of times, and not of all particular persons.

<P>There be, that are in nature faithful, and sincere,

<P>and plain, and direct; not crafty and involved; let

<P>princes, above all, draw to themselves such na-

<P>tures.&nbsp; Besides, counsellors are not commonly so

<P>united, but that one counsellor, keepeth sentinel

<P>over another; so that if any do counsel out of fac-

<P>tion or private ends, it commonly comes to the

<P>king's ear.&nbsp; But the best remedy is, if princes know

<P>their counsellors, as well as their counsellors

<P>know them:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Principis est virtus maxima nosse suos.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And on the other side, counsellors should not be

<P>too speculative into their sovereign's person.&nbsp; The

<P>true composition of a counsellor, is rather to be

<P>skilful in their master's business, than in his na-

<P>ture; for then he is like to advise him, and not feed

<P>his humor.&nbsp; It is of singular use to princes, if they

<P>take the opinions of their counsel, both separately

<P>and together.&nbsp; For private opinion is more free;

<P>but opinion before others, is more reverent.&nbsp; In

<P>private, men are more bold in their own humors;

<P>and in consort, men are more obnoxious to others'

<P>humors; therefore it is good to take both; and of

<P>the inferior sort, rather in private, to preserve free-

<P>dom; of the greater, rather in consort, to preserve

<P>respect.&nbsp; It is in vain for princes, to take counsel

<P>concerning matters, if they take no counsel like-

<P>wise concerning persons; for all matters are as

<P>dead images; and the life of the execution of af-

<P>fairs, resteth in the good choice of persons.&nbsp; Neither

<P>is it enough, to consult concerning persons secun-

<P>dum genera, as in an idea, or mathematical de-

<P>scription, what the kind and character of the

<P>person should be; for the greatest errors are com-

<P>mitted, and the most judgment is shown, in the

<P>choice of individuals.&nbsp; It was truly said, optimi con-

<P>siliarii mortui: books will speak plain, when coun-

<P>sellors blanch.Therefore it is good to be conversant

<P>in them, specially the books of such as themselves

<P>have been actors upon the stage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The counsels at this day, in most places, are but

<P>familiar meetings, where matters are rather talked

<P>on, than debated.&nbsp; And they run too swift, to the

<P>order, or act, of counsel.&nbsp; It were better that in

<P>causes of weight, the matter were propounded one

<P>day, and not spoken to till the next day; in nocte

<P>consilium.&nbsp; So was it done in the Commission of

<P>Union, between England and Scotland; which

<P>was a grave and orderly assembly.&nbsp; I commend set

<P>days for petitions; for both it gives the sudtors more

<P>certainty for their attendance, and it frees the

<P>meetings for matters of estate, that they may hoc

<P>agere.&nbsp; In choice of committees; for ripening busi-

<P>ness for the counsel, it is better to choose indifferent

<P>persons, than to make an indifferency, by putting

<P>in those, that are strong on both sides.&nbsp; I commend

<P>also standing commissions; as for trade, for treas-

<P>ure, for war, for suits, for some provinces; for

<P>where there be divers particular counsels, and but

<P>one counsel of estate (as it is in Spain), they are, in

<P>effect, no more than standing commissions: save

<P>that they have greater authority.&nbsp; Let such as are

<P>to inform counsels, out of their particular profes-

<P>sions (as lawyers, seamen, mintmen, and the like)

<P>be first heard before committees; and then, as oc-

<P>casion serves, before the counsel.&nbsp; And let them not

<P>come in multitudes, or in a tribunitious manner;

<P>for that is to clamor counsels, not to inform them.

<P>A long table and a square table, or seats about the

<P>walls, seem things of form, but are things of sub-

<P>stance; for at a long table a few at the upper end, in

<P>effect, sway all the business; but in the other form,

<P>there is more use of the counsellors' opinions, that

<P>sit lower.&nbsp; A king, when he presides in counsel, let

<P>him beware how he opens his own inclination too

<P>much, in that which he propoundeth; for else

<P>counsellors will but take the wind of him, and in-

<P>stead of giving free counsel, sing him a song of

<P>placebo.
