<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>RELIGION being the chief band of human so-

<P>ciety, it is a happy thing, when itself is well

<P>contained within the true band of unity.&nbsp; The

<P>quarrels, and divisions about religion, were evils

<P>unknown to the heathen.&nbsp; The reason was, because

<P>the religion of the heathen, consisted rather in

<P>rites and ceremonies, than in any constant belief.

<P>For you may imagine, what kind of faith theirs

<P>was, when the chief doctors, and fathers of their

<P>church, were the poets.&nbsp; But the true God hath this

<P>attribute, that he is a jealous God; and therefore,

<P>his worship and religion, will endure no mixture,

<P>nor partner.We shall therefore speak a few words,

<P>concerning the unity of the church; what are the

<P>fruits thereof ; what the bounds; and what the

<P>means.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fruits of unity (next unto the well pleasing

<P>of God, which is all in all) are two: the one, towards

<P>those that are without the church, the other,

<P>towards those that are within.&nbsp; For the former; it is

<P>certain, that heresies, and schisms, are of all others

<P>the greatest scandals; yea, more than corruption

<P>of manners.&nbsp; For as in the natural body, a wound,

<P>or solution of continuity, is worse than a corrupt

<P>humor; so in the spiritual.&nbsp; So that nothing, doth so

<P>much keep men out of the church, and drive men

<P>out of the church, as breach of unity.&nbsp; And there-

<P>fore, whensoever it cometh to that pass, that one

<P>saith, Ecce in deserto, another saith, Ecce in pene-

<P>tralibus; that is, when some men seek Christ, in the

<P>conventicles of heretics, and others, in an outward

<P>face of a church, that voice had need continually

<P>to sound in men's ears, Nolite exire, - Go not out.

<P>The doctor of the Gentiles (the propriety of whose

<P>vocation, drew him to have a special care of those

<P>without) saith, if an heathen come in, and hear

<P>you speak with several tongues, will he not say

<P>that you are mad? And certainly it is little better,

<P>when atheists, and profane persons, do hear of

<P>so many discordant, and contrary opinions in re-

<P>ligion; it doth avert them from the church, and

<P>maketh them, to sit down in the chair of the

<P>scorners. It is but a light thing, to be vouched in so

<P>serious a matter, but yet it expresseth well the

<P>deformity.&nbsp; There is a master of scoffing, that in his

<P>catalogue of books of a feigned library, sets down

<P>this title of a book, The Morris-Dance of Heretics.

<P>For indeed, every sect of them, hath a diverse pos-

<P>ture, or cringe by themselves, which cannot but

<P>move derision in worldlings, and depraved politics,

<P>who are apt to contemn holy things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for the fruit towards those that are within; it

<P>is peace; which containeth infinite blessings.&nbsp; It

<P>establisheth faith; it kindleth charity; the outward

<P>peace of the church, distilleth into peace of con-

<P>science; and it turneth the labors of writing, and

<P>reading of controversies, into treaties of mortifica-

<P>tion and devotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Concerning the bounds of unity; the true plac-

<P>ing of them, importeth exceedingly.&nbsp; There appear

<P>to be two extremes.&nbsp; For to certain zealants, all

<P>speech of pacification is odious.&nbsp; Is it peace, Jehu,?

<P>What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee be-

<P>hind me.&nbsp; Peace is not the matter, but following,

<P>and party.&nbsp; Contrariwise, certain Laodiceans, and

<P>lukewarm persons, think they may accommodate

<P>points of religion, by middle way, and taking part

<P>of both, and witty reconcilements; as if they would

<P>make an arbitrament between God and man.&nbsp; Both

<P>these extremes are to be avoided; which will be

<P>done, if the league of Christians, penned by our

<P>Savior himself, were in two cross clauses thereof,

<P>soundly and plainly expounded: He that is not

<P>with us, is against us; and again, He that is not

<P>against us, is with us; that is, if the points funda-

<P>mental and of substance in religion, were truly

<P>discerned and distinguished, from points not

<P>merely of faith, but of opinion, order, or good in-

<P>tention.&nbsp; This is a thing may seem to many a matter

<P>trivial, and done already.&nbsp; But if it were done less

<P>partially, it would be embraced more generally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of this I may give only this advice, according to

<P>my small model.&nbsp; Men ought to take heed, of rend-

<P>ing God's church, by two kinds of controversies.

<P>The one is, when the matter of the point contro-

<P>verted, is too small and light, not worth the heat

<P>and strife about it, kindled only by contradiction.

<P>For, as it is noted, by one of the fathers, Christ's

<P>coat indeed had no seam, but the church's vesture

<P>was of divers colors; whereupon he saith, In veste

<P>varietas sit, scissura non sit; they be two things,

<P>unity and uniformity.&nbsp; The other is, when the

<P>matter of the point controverted, is great, but it is

<P>driven to an over-great subtilty, and obscurity; so

<P>that it becometh a thing rather ingenious, than

<P>substantial.&nbsp; A man that is of judgment and under-

<P>standing, shall sometimes hear ignorant men dif-

<P>fer, and know well within himself, that those

<P>which so differ, mean one thing, and yet they

<P>themselves would never agree.&nbsp; And if it come so

<P>to pass, in that distance of judgment, which is be-

<P>tween man and man, shall we not think that God

<P>above, that knows the heart, doth not discern that

<P>frail men, in some of their contradictions, intend

<P>the same thing; and accepteth of both? The nature

<P>of such controversies is excellently expressed, by

<P>St. Paul, in the warning and precept, that he giveth

<P>concerning the same, Devita profanas vocum novi-

<P>tates, et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae.&nbsp; Men

<P>create oppositions, which are not; and put them

<P>into new terms, so fixed, as whereas the meaning

<P>ought to govern the term, the term in effect gov-

<P>erneth the meaning.There be also two false peaces,

<P>or unities: the one, when the peace is grounded,

<P>but upon an implicit ignorance; for all colors will

<P>agree in the dark: the other, when it is pieced up,

<P>upon a direct admission of contraries, in funda-

<P>mental points.&nbsp; For truth and falsehood, in such

<P>things, are like the iron and clay, in the toes of

<P>Nebuchadnezzar's image; they may cleave, but

<P>they will not incorporate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Concerning the means of procuring unity; men

<P>must beware, that in the procuring, or reuniting,

<P>of religious unity, they do not dissolve and deface

<P>the laws of charity, and of human society.&nbsp; There

<P>be two swords amongst Christians, the spiritual

<P>and temporal; and both have their due office and

<P>place, in the maintenance of religion.&nbsp; But we may

<P>not take up the third sword, which is Mahomet's

<P>sword, or like unto it; that is, to propagate religion

<P>by wars, or by sanguinary persecutions to force

<P>consciences; except it be in cases of overt scandal,

<P>blasphemy, or intermixture of practice against

<P>the state; much less to nourish seditions; to author-

<P>ize conspiracies and rebellions; to put the sword

<P>into the people's hands; and the like; tending to

<P>the subversion of all government, which is the

<P>ordinance of God.&nbsp; For this is but to dash the first

<P>table against the second; and so to consider men

<P>as Christians, as we forget that they are men.

<P>Lucretius the poet, when he beheld the act of Aga-

<P>memnon, that could endure the sacrificing of his

<P>own daughter, exclaimed: Tantum Religio potuit

<P>suadere malorum.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What would he have said, if he had known of

<P>the massacre in France, or the powder treason of

<P>England? He would have been seven times more

<P>Epicure, and atheist, than he was.&nbsp; For as the tem-

<P>poral sword is to be drawn with great circumspec-

<P>tion in cases of religion; so it is a thing monstrous

<P>to put it into the hands of the common people.&nbsp; Let

<P>that be left unto the Anabaptists, and other furies.

<P>It was great blasphemy, when the devil said, I will

<P>ascend, and be like the highest; but it is greater

<P>blasphemy, to personate God, and bring him in

<P>saying, I will descend, and be like the prince of

<P>darkness; and what is it better, to make the cause

<P>of religion to descend, to the cruel and execrable

<P>actions of murthering princes, butchery of people,

<P>and subversion of states and governments? Surely

<P>this is to bring down the Holy Ghost, instead of the

<P>likeness of a dove, in the shape of a vulture or

<P>raven; and set, out of the bark of a Christian

<P>church, a flag of a bark of pirates, and assassins.

<P>Therefore it is most necessary, that the church, by

<P>doctrine and decree, princes by their sword, and

<P>all learnings, both Christian and moral, as by their

<P>Mercury rod, do damn and send to hell for ever,

<P>those facts and opinions tending to the support of

<P>the same; as hath been already in good part done.

<P>Surely in counsels concerning religion, that coun-

<P>sel of the apostle would be prefixed, Ira hominis

<P>non implet justitiam Dei.&nbsp; And it was a notable

<P>observation of a wise father, and no less ingenu-

<P>ously confessed; that those which held and per-

<P>suaded pressure of consciences, were commonly

<P>interested therein., themselves, for their own ends.
