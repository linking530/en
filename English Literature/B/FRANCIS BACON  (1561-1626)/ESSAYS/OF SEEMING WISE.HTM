<P>IT HATH been an opinion, that the French are

<P>wiser than they seem, and the Spaniards seem

<P>wiser than they are.&nbsp; But howsoever it be between

<P>nations, certainly it is so between man and man.

<P>For as the Apostle saith of godliness, Having a

<P>show of godliness, but denying the power thereof;

<P>so certainly there are, in point of wisdom and suf-

<P>ficiently, that do nothing or little very solemnly:

<P>magno conatu nugas.&nbsp; It is a ridiculous thing, and

<P>fit for a satire to persons of judgment, to see what

<P>shifts these formalists have, and what prospectives

<P>to make superficies to seem body, that hath depth

<P>and bulk.&nbsp; Some are so close and reserved, as they

<P>will not show their wares, but by a dark light; and

<P>seem always to keep back somewhat; and when

<P>they know within themselves, they speak of that

<P>they do not well know, would nevertheless seem

<P>to others, to know of that which they may not well

<P>speak.&nbsp; Some help themselves with countenance

<P>and gesture, and are wise by signs; as Cicero saith

<P>of Piso, that when he answered him, he fetched

<P>one of his brows up to his forehead, and bent the

<P>other down to his chin; Respondes, altero ad fron-

<P>tem sublato,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; altero ad mentum depresso super-

<P>cilio, crudelitatem tibi non placere.&nbsp; Some think

<P>to bear it by speaking a great word, and being per-

<P>emptory; and go on, and take by admittance, that

<P>which they cannot make good.&nbsp; Some, whatsoever

<P>is beyond their reach, will seem to despise, or make

<P>light of it, as impertinent or curious; and so would

<P>have their ignorance seem judgment.&nbsp; Some are

<P>never without a difference, and commonly by

<P>amusing men with a subtilty, blanch the matter;

<P>of whom A. Gellius saith, Hominem delirum, qui

<P>verborum minutiis rerum&nbsp; frangit pondera.&nbsp; Of

<P>which kind also, Plato, in his Protagoras, bringeth

<P>in Prodius in scorn, and maketh him make a

<P>speech, that consisteth of distinction from the be-

<P>ginning to the end.&nbsp; Generally, such men in all

<P>deliberations find ease to be of the negative side,

<P>and affect a credit to object and foretell difficul-

<P>ties; for when propositions are denied, there is an

<P>end of them; but if they be allowed, it requireth a

<P>new work; which false point of wisdom is the bane

<P>of business.&nbsp; To conclude, there is no decaying mer-

<P>chant, or inward beggar, hath so many tricks to

<P>uphold the credit of their wealth, as these empty

<P>persons have, to maintain the credit of their suf-

<P>ficiency.&nbsp; Seeming wise men may make shift to get

<P>opinion; but let no man choose them for employ-

<P>ment; for certainly you were better take for busi-

<P>ness, a man somewhat absurd, than over-formal.
