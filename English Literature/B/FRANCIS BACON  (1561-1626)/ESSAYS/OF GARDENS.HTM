<P>G0D Almighty first planted a garden.&nbsp; And

<P>indeed it is the purest of human pleasures.

<P>It is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man;

<P>without which, buildings and palaces are but

<P>gross handiworks; and a man shall ever see, that

<P>when ages grow to civility and elegancy, men

<P>come to build stately sooner than to garden finely;

<P>as if gardening were the greater perfection.&nbsp; I do

<P>hold it, in the royal ordering of gardens, there

<P>ought to be gardens, for all the months in the year;

<P>in which severally things of beauty may be then

<P>in season.&nbsp; For December, and January, and the

<P>latter part of November, you must take such things

<P>as are green all winter: holly; ivy; bays; juniper;

<P>cypress-trees; yew; pine-apple-trees; fir-trees;

<P>rosemary; lavender; periwinkle, the white, the

<P>purple, and the blue; germander; flags; orange-

<P>trees; lemon-trees; and myrtles, if they be stoved;

<P>and sweet marjoram, warm set.&nbsp; There followeth,

<P>for the latter part of January and February, the

<P>mezereon-tree, which then blossoms; crocus ver-

<P>nus, both the yellow and the grey; primroses,

<P>anemones; the early tulippa; hyacinthus orien-

<P>talis; chamairis; fritellaria.&nbsp; For March, there

<P>come violets, specially the single blue, which are

<P>the earliest; the yellow daffodil; the daisy; the

<P>almond-tree in blossom; the peach-tree in blos-

<P>som; the cornelian-tree in blossom; sweet-briar.

<P>In April follow the double white violet; the wall-

<P>flower; the stock-gilliflower; the cowslip; flower-

<P>delices, and lilies of all natures; rosemary-flowers;

<P>the tulippa; the double peony; the pale daffodil;

<P>the French honeysuckle; the cherry-tree in blos-

<P>som; the damson and plum-trees in blossom; the

<P>white thorn in leaf; the lilac-tree.&nbsp; In May and

<P>June come pinks of all sorts, specially the blush-

<P>pink; roses of all kinds, except the musk, which

<P>comes later; honeysuckles; strawberries; bugloss;

<P>columbine; the French marigold, flos Africanus;

<P>cherry-tree in fruit; ribes; figs in fruit; rasps; vine-

<P>flowers; lavender in flowers; the sweet satyrian,

<P>with the white flower; herba muscaria; lilium

<P>convallium; the apple-tree in blossom.&nbsp; In July

<P>come gilliflowers of all varieties; musk-roses; the

<P>lime-tree in blossom; early pears and plums in

<P>fruit; jennetings, codlins.&nbsp; In August come plums

<P>of all sorts in fruit; pears; apricocks; berberries;

<P>filberds; musk-melons; monks-hoods, of all colors.

<P>In September come grapes; apples; poppies of

<P>all colors; peaches; melocotones; nectarines; cor-

<P>nelians; wardens; quinces.&nbsp; In October and the

<P>beginning of November come services; medlars;

<P>bullaces; roses cut or removed to come late; holly-

<P>hocks; and such like.&nbsp; These particulars are for the

<P>climate of London; but my meaning is perceived,

<P>that you may have ver perpetuum, as the place

<P>affords.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter

<P>in the air (where it comes and goes like the warb-

<P>ling of music) than in the hand, therefore nothing

<P>is more fit for that delight, than to know what be

<P>the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.

<P>Roses, damask and red, are fast flowers of their

<P>smells; so that you may walk by a whole row of

<P>them, and find nothing of their sweetness; yea

<P>though it be in a morning's dew.&nbsp; Bays likewise

<P>yield no smell as they grow.&nbsp; Rosemary little; nor

<P>sweet marjoram.&nbsp; That which above all others

<P>yields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet,

<P>specially the white double violet, which comes

<P>twice a year; about the middle of April, and about

<P>Bartholomew-tide.&nbsp; Next to that is the musk-rose.

<P>Then the strawberry-leaves dying, which yield a

<P>most excellent cordial smell.&nbsp; Then the flower of

<P>vines; it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which

<P>grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth.

<P>Then sweet-briar.&nbsp; Then wall-flowers, which are

<P>very delightful to be set under a parlor or lower

<P>chamber window.&nbsp; Then pinks and gilliflowers,

<P>especially the matted pink and clove gilliflower.

<P>Then the flowers of the lime-tree.&nbsp; Then the honey-

<P>suckles, so they be somewhat afar off.&nbsp; Of bean-

<P>flowers I speak not, because they are field flowers.

<P>But those which perfume the air most delightfully,

<P>not passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon

<P>and crushed, are three; that is, burnet, wild-

<P>thyme, and watermints.&nbsp; Therefore you are to set

<P>whole alleys of them, to have the pleasure when

<P>you walk or tread.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For gardens (speaking of those which are indeed

<P>princelike, as we have done of buildings), the con-

<P>tents ought not well to be under thirty acres of

<P>ground; and to be divided into three parts; a green

<P>in the entrance; a heath or desert in the going

<P>forth; and the main garden in the midst; besides

<P>alleys on both sides.&nbsp; And I like well that four acres

<P>of ground be assigned to the green; six to the

<P>heath; four and four to either side; and twelve to

<P>the main garden.&nbsp; The green hath two pleasures:

<P>the one, because nothing is more pleasant to the

<P>eye than green grass kept finely shorn; the other,

<P>because it will give you a fair alley in the midst, by

<P>which you may go in front upon a stately hedge,

<P>which is to enclose the garden.&nbsp; But because the

<P>alley will be long, and, in great heat of the year or

<P>day, you ought not to buy the shade in the garden,

<P>by going in the sun through the green, therefore

<P>you are, of either side the green, to plant a covert

<P>alley upon carpenter's work, about twelve foot in

<P>height, by which you may go in shade into the

<P>garden.&nbsp; As for the making of knots or figures, with

<P>divers colored earths,&nbsp; that they may lie under the

<P>windows of the house on that side which the gar-

<P>den stands, they be but toys; you may see as good

<P>sights, many times, in tarts.&nbsp; The garden is best to

<P>be square, encompassed on all the four sides with

<P>a stately arched hedge.&nbsp; The arches to be upon pil-

<P>lars of carpenter's work, of some ten foot high, and

<P>six foot broad; and the spaces between of the same

<P>dimension with the breadth of the arch.&nbsp; Over the

<P>arches let there be an entire hedge of some four

<P>foot high, framed also upon carpenter's work; and

<P>upon the upper hedge, over every arch, a little tur-

<P>ret, with a belly, enough to receive a cage of birds:

<P>and over every space between the arches some

<P>other little figure, with broad plates of round col-

<P>ored glass gilt, for the sun to play upon.&nbsp; But this

<P>hedge I intend to be raised upon a bank, not steep,

<P>but gently slope, of some six foot, set all with

<P>flowers.&nbsp; Also I understand, that this square of the

<P>garden, should not be the whole breadth of the

<P>ground, but to leave on either side, ground enough

<P>for diversity of side alleys; unto which the two

<P>covert alleys of the green, may deliver you.&nbsp; But

<P>there must be no alleys with hedges, at either end

<P>of this great enclosure; not at the hither end, for

<P>letting your prospect upon this fair hedge from

<P>the green; nor at the further end, for letting your

<P>prospect from the hedge, through the arches upon

<P>the heath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the ordering of the ground, within the great

<P>hedge, I leave it to variety of device; advising

<P>nevertheless, that whatsoever form you cast it into,

<P>first, it be not too busy, or full of work.&nbsp; Wherein I,

<P>for my part, do not like images cut out in juniper

<P>or other garden stuff; they be for children.&nbsp; Little

<P>low hedges, round, like welts, with some pretty

<P>pyramids, I like well; and in some places, fair

<P>columns upon frames of carpenter's work.&nbsp; I would

<P>also have the alleys, spacious and fair.&nbsp; You may

<P>have closer alleys, upon the side grounds, but none

<P>in the main garden.&nbsp; I wish also, in the very middle,

<P>a fair mount, with three ascents, and alleys,

<P>enough for four to walk abreast; which I would

<P>have to be perfect circles, without any bulwarks

<P>or embossments; and the whole mount to be thirty

<P>foot high; and some fine banqueting-house, with

<P>some chimneys neatly cast, and without too much

<P>glass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For fountains, they are a great beauty and re-

<P>freshment; but pools mar all, and make the garden

<P>unwholesome, and full of flies and frogs.&nbsp; Foun-

<P>tains I intend to be of two natures: the one that

<P>sprinkleth or spouteth water; the other a fair re-

<P>ceipt of water, of some thirty or forty foot square,

<P>but without fish, or slime, or mud.&nbsp; For the first,

<P>the ornaments of images gilt, or of marble, which

<P>are in use, do well: but the main matter is so to

<P>convey the water, as it never stay, either in the

<P>bowls or in the cistern; that the water be never by

<P>rest discolored, green or red or the like; or gather

<P>any mossiness or putrefaction.&nbsp; Besides that, it is to

<P>be cleansed every day by the hand.&nbsp; Also some

<P>steps up to it, and some fine pavement about it,

<P>doth well.&nbsp; As for the other kind of fountain, which

<P>we may call a bathing pool, it may admit much

<P>curiosity and beauty; wherewith we will not

<P>trouble ourselves: as, that the bottom be finely

<P>paved, and with images; the sides likewise; and

<P>withal embellished with colored glass, and such

<P>things of lustre; encompassed also with fine rails

<P>of low statuas.&nbsp; But the main point is the same

<P>which we mentioned in the former kind of foun-

<P>tain; which is, that the water be in perpetual

<P>motion, fed by a water higher than the pool, and

<P>delivered into it by fair spouts, and then dis-

<P>charged away under ground, by some equality of

<P>bores, that it stay little.&nbsp; And for fine devices, of

<P>arching water without spilling, and making it rise

<P>in several forms (of feathers, drinking glasses,

<P>canopies, and the like), they be pretty things to

<P>look on, but nothing to health and sweetness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the heath, which was the third part of our

<P>plot, I wish it to be framed, as much as may be, to

<P>a natural wildness.&nbsp; Trees I would have none in it,

<P>but some thickets made only of sweet-briar and

<P>honeysuckle, and some wild vine amongst; and

<P>the ground set with violets, strawberries, and

<P>primroses.&nbsp; For these are sweet, and prosper in the

<P>shade.&nbsp; And these to be in the heath, here and there,

<P>not in any order.&nbsp; I like also little heaps, in the na-

<P>ture of mole-hills (such as are in wild heaths), to

<P>be set, some with wild thyme; some with pinks;

<P>some with germander, that gives a good flower to

<P>the eye; some with periwinkle; some with violets;

<P>some with strawberries; some&nbsp; with cowslips; some

<P>with daisies; some with red roses; some with lilium

<P>convallium; some with sweet-williams red; some

<P>with bear's-foot: and the like low flowers, being

<P>withal sweet and sightly.&nbsp; Part of which heaps, are

<P>to be with standards of little bushes pricked upon

<P>their top, and part without.&nbsp; The standards to be

<P>roses; juniper; holly; berberries (but here and

<P>there, because of the smell of their blossoms); red

<P>currants; gooseberries; rosemary; bays; sweet-

<P>briar; and such like.&nbsp; But these standards to be kept

<P>with cutting, that they grow not out of course.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the side grounds, you are to fill them with

<P>variety of alleys, private, to give a full shade, some

<P>of them, wheresoever the sun be.&nbsp; You are to frame

<P>some of them, likewise, for shelter, that when the

<P>wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery.

<P>And those alleys must be likewise hedged at both

<P>ends, to keep out the wind; and these closer alleys

<P>must be ever finely gravelled, and no grass, be-

<P>cause of going wet.&nbsp; In many of these alleys, like-

<P>wise, you are to set fruit-trees of all sorts; as well

<P>upon the walls, as in ranges.&nbsp; And this would be

<P>generally observed, that the borders wherein you

<P>plant your fruit-trees, be fair and large, and low,

<P>and not steep; and set with fine flowers, but thin

<P>and sparingly, lest they deceive the trees.&nbsp; At the

<P>end of both the side grounds, I would have a mount

<P>of some pretty height, leaving the wall of the en-

<P>closure breast high, to look abroad into the fields.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the main garden, I do not deny, but there

<P>should be some fair alleys ranged on both sides,

<P>with fruit-trees; and some pretty tufts of fruit-

<P>trees, and arbors with seats, set in some decent

<P>order; but these to be by no means set too thick; but

<P>to leave the main garden so as it be not close, but

<P>the air open and free.&nbsp; For as for shade, I would

<P>have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds,

<P>there to walk, if you be disposed, in the heat of the

<P>year or day; but to make account, that the main

<P>garden is for the more temperate parts of the year;

<P>and in the heat of summer, for the morning and

<P>the evening, or overcast days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For aviaries, I like them not, except they be of

<P>that largeness as they may be turfed, and have

<P>living plants and bushes set in them; that the birds

<P>may have more scope, and natural nesting, and

<P>that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary.

<P>So I have made a platform of a princely garden,

<P>partly by precept, partly by drawing, not a model,

<P>but some general lines of it; and in this I have

<P>spared for no cost.&nbsp; But it is nothing for great

<P>princes, that for the most part taking advice with

<P>workmen, with no less cost set their things to-

<P>gether; and sometimes add statuas and such things

<P>for state and magnificence, but nothing to the true

<P>pleasure of a garden.
