<P>PRAISE is the reflection of virtue; but it is as

<P>the glass or body, which giveth the reflec-

<P>tion.&nbsp; If it be from the common people, it is com-

<P>monly false and naught; and rather followeth vain

<P>persons, than virtuous.&nbsp; For the common people

<P>understand not many excellent virtues.&nbsp; The lowest

<P>virtues draw praise from them; the middle virtues

<P>work in them astonishment or admiration; but of

<P>the highest virtues, they have no sense of perceiv-

<P>ing at all.&nbsp; But shows, and species virtutibus similes,

<P>serve best with them.&nbsp; Certainly fame is like a river,

<P>that beareth up things light and swoln, and drowns

<P>things weighty and solid.&nbsp; But if persons of quality

<P>and judgment concur, then it is (as the Scripture

<P>saith) nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis.

<P>It fireth all round about, and will not easily away.

<P>For the odors of ointments are more durable, than

<P>those of flowers.&nbsp; There be so many false points of

<P>praise, that a man may justly hold it a suspect.

<P>Some praises proceed merely of flattery; and if he

<P>be an ordinary flatterer, he will have certain com-

<P>mon attributes, which may serve every man; if he

<P>be a cunning flatterer, he will follow the arch-

<P>flatterer, which is a man's self; and wherein a man

<P>thinketh best of himself, therein the flatterer will

<P>uphold him most: but if he be an impudent flat-

<P>terer, look wherein a man is conscious to himself,

<P>that he is most defective, and is most out of counte-

<P>nance in himself, that will the flatterer entitle him

<P>to perforce, spreta conscientia.&nbsp; Some praises come

<P>of good wishes and respects, which is a form due, in

<P>civility, to kings and great persons, laudando

<P>praecipere, when by telling men what they are,

<P>they represent to them, what they should be.&nbsp; Some

<P>men are praised maliciously, to their hurt, thereby

<P>to stir envy and jealousy towards them: pessimum

<P>genus inimicorum laudantium; insomuch as it

<P>was a proverb, amongst the Grecians, that he that

<P>was praised to his hurt, should have a push rise

<P>upon his nose; as we say, that a blister will rise

<P>upon one's tongue, that tells a lie.&nbsp; Certainly mod-

<P>erate praise, used with opportunity, and not vul-

<P>gar, is that which doth the good.&nbsp; Solomon saith,

<P>He that praiseth his friend aloud, rising early, it

<P>shall be to him no better than a curse.&nbsp; Too much

<P>magnifying of man or matter, doth irritate con-

<P>tradiction, and procure envy and scorn.&nbsp; To praise

<P>a man's self, cannot be decent, except it be in rare

<P>cases; but to praise a man's office or profession, he

<P>may do it with good grace, and with a kind of mag-

<P>nanimity.&nbsp; The cardinals of Rome, which are theo-

<P>logues, and friars, and Schoolmen, have a phrase

<P>of notable contempt and scorn towards civil busi-

<P>ness: for they call all temporal business of wars,

<P>embassages, judicature, and other employments,

<P>sbirrerie, which is under-sheriffries; as if they

<P>were but matters, for under-sheriffs and catch-

<P>poles: though many times those under-sheriffries

<P>do more good, than their high speculations.&nbsp; St.

<P>Paul, when he boasts of himself, he doth oft inter-

<P>lace, I speak like a fool; but speaking of his calling,

<P>he saith, magnificabo apostolatum meum.
