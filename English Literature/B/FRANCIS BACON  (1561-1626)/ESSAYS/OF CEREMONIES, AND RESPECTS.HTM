<P>HE THAT is only real, had need have exceed-

<P>ing great parts of virtue; as the stone had

<P>need to be rich, that is set without foil.&nbsp; But if a

<P>man mark it well,&nbsp; it is, in praise and commenda-

<P>tion of men, as it is in gettings and gains: for the

<P>proverb is true, That light gains make heavy

<P>purses; for light gains come thick, whereas great,

<P>come but now and then.&nbsp; So it is true, that small

<P>matters win great commendation, because they

<P>are continually in use and in note: whereas the

<P>occasion of any great virtue, cometh but on festi-

<P>vals.&nbsp; Therefore it doth much add to a man's reputa-

<P>tion, and is (as Queen Isabella said) like perpetual

<P>letters commendatory, to have good forms.&nbsp; To at-

<P>tain them, it almost sufficeth not to despise them;

<P>for so shall a man observe them in others; and let

<P>him trust himself with the rest.&nbsp; For if he labor too

<P>much to express them, he shall lose their grace;

<P>which is to be natural and unaffected.&nbsp; Some men's

<P>behavior is like a verse, wherein every syllable is

<P>measured; how can a man comprehend great mat-

<P>ters, that breaketh his mind too much, to small

<P>observations? Not to use ceremonies at all, is to

<P>teach others not to use them again; and so dimin-

<P>isheth respect to himself; especially they be not to

<P>be omitted, to strangers and formal natures; but

<P>the dwelling upon them, and exalting them above

<P>the moon, is not only tedious, but doth diminish

<P>the faith and credit of him that speaks.&nbsp; And cer-

<P>tainly, there is a kind of conveying, of effectual

<P>and imprinting passages amongst compliments,

<P>which is of singular use, if a man can hit upon it.

<P>Amongst a man's peers, a man shall be sure of

<P>familiarity; and therefore it is good, a little to keep

<P>state.&nbsp; Amongst a man's inferiors one shall be sure

<P>of reverence; and therefore it is good, a little to be

<P>familiar.&nbsp; He that is too much in anything, so that

<P>he giveth another occasion of satiety, maketh him-

<P>self cheap.&nbsp; To apply one's self to others, is good; so

<P>it be with demonstration, that a man doth it upon

<P>regard, and not upon facility.&nbsp; It is a good precept

<P>generally, in seconding another, yet to add some-

<P>what of one's own: as if you will grant his opinion,

<P>let it be with some distinction; if you will follow

<P>his motion, let it be with condition; if you allow

<P>his counsel, let it be with alleging further reason.

<P>Men had need beware, how they be too perfect in

<P>compliments; for be they never so sufficient other-

<P>wise, their enviers will be sure to give them that

<P>attribute, to the disadvantage of their greater vir-

<P>tues.&nbsp; It is loss also in business, to be too full of re-

<P>spects, or to be curious, in observing times and

<P>opportunities.&nbsp; Solomon saith, He that considereth

<P>the wind, shall not sow, and he that looketh to

<P>the clouds, shall not reap.&nbsp; A wise man will make

<P>more opportunities, than he finds.&nbsp; Men's behavior

<P>should be, like their apparel, not too strait or point

<P>device, but free for exercise or motion.
