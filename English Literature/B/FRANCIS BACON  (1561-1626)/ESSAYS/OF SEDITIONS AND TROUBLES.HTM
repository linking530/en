<P>SHEPHERDS of people, had need know the

<P>calendars of tempests in state; which are com-

<P>monly greatest, when things grow to equality; as

<P>natural tempests are greatest about the Equinoc-

<P>tia.&nbsp; And as there are certain hollow blasts of wind,

<P>and secret swellings of seas before a tempest, so

<P>are there in states:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>--Ille etiam caecos instare tumultus

<P>Saepe monet, fraudesque et operta tunescere bella.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Libels and licentious discourses against the state,

<P>when they are frequent and open; and in like sort,

<P>false news often running up and down, to the dis-

<P>advantage of the state, and hastily embraced; are

<P>amongst the signs of troubles.&nbsp; Virgil, giving the

<P>pedigree of Fame, saith, she was sister to the Giants:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Illam Terra parens, irra irritata deorum,

<P>Extremam (ut perhibent) Coeo Enceladoque sororem

<P>Progenuit.-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As if fames were the relics of seditions past; but

<P>they are no less, indeed, the preludes of seditions to

<P>come.&nbsp; Howsoever he noteth it right, that seditious

<P>tumults, and seditious fames, differ no more but

<P>as brother and sister, masculine and feminine; es-

<P>pecially if it come to that, that the best actions of

<P>a state, and the most plausible, and which ought

<P>to give greatest contentment, are taken in ill sense,

<P>and traduced: for that shows the envy great, as

<P>Tacitus saith; conflata magna invidia, seu bene

<P>seu male gesta premunt.&nbsp; Neither doth it follow,

<P>that because these fames are a sign of troubles, that

<P>the suppressing of them with too much severity,

<P>should be a remedy of troubles.&nbsp; For the despising

<P>of them, many times checks them best; and the

<P>going about to stop them, doth but make a wonder

<P>long-lived.&nbsp; Also that kind of obedience, which

<P>Tacitus speaketh of, is to be held suspected: Erant

<P>in officio, sed tamen qui mallent mandata impe-

<P>rantium interpretari quam exequi; disputing, ex-

<P>cusing, cavilling upon mandates and directions, is

<P>a kind of shaking off the yoke, and assay of dis-

<P>obedience; especially if in those disputings, they

<P>which are for the direction, speak fearfully and

<P>tenderly, and those that are against it, audaciously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Also, as Machiavel noteth well, when princes,

<P>that ought to be common parents, make them-

<P>selves as a party, and lean to a side, it is as a boat,

<P>that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one

<P>side; as was well seen, in the time of Henry the

<P>Third of France; for first, himself entered league

<P>for the extirpation of the Protestants; and pres-

<P>ently after, the same league was turned upon him-

<P>self.&nbsp; For when the authority of princes, is made

<P>but an accessory to a cause, and that there be other

<P>bands, that tie faster than the band of sovereignty,

<P>kings begin to be put almost out of possession.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Also, when discords, and quarrels, and factions

<P>are carried openly and audaciously, it is a sign the

<P>reverence of government is lost.&nbsp; For the motions

<P>of the greatest persons in a government, ought to

<P>be as the motions of the planets under primum

<P>mobile; according to the old opinion: which is,

<P>that every of them, is carried swiftly by the

<P>highest motion, and softly in their own motion.

<P>And therefore, when great ones in their own

<P>particular motion, move violently, and, as Tacitus

<P>expresseth it well, liberius quam ut imperan-

<P>tium meminissent; it is a sign the orbs are out

<P>of frame.&nbsp; For reverence is that, wherewith princes

<P>are girt from God; who threateneth the dissolving

<P>thereof; Solvam cingula regum.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when any of the four pillars of government,

<P>are mainly shaken, or weakened (which are relig-

<P>ion, justice, counsel, and treasure), men had need

<P>to pray for fair weather.&nbsp; But let us pass from this

<P>part of predictions (concerning which, neverthe-

<P>less, more light may be taken from that which

<P>followeth); and let us speak first, of the materials

<P>of seditions; then of the motives of them; and

<P>thirdly of the remedies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Concerning the materials of seditions.&nbsp; It is a

<P>thing well to be considered; for the surest way to

<P>prevent seditions (if the times do bear it) is to take

<P>away the matter of them.&nbsp; For if there be fuel pre-

<P>pared, it is hard to tell, whence the spark shall

<P>come, that shall set it on fire.&nbsp; The matter of sedi-

<P>tions is of two kinds: much poverty, and much dis-

<P>contentment.&nbsp; It is certain, so many overthrown

<P>estates, so many votes for troubles.&nbsp; Lucan noteth

<P>well the state of Rome before the Civil War,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hinc usura vorax, rapidumque in tempore foenus,

<P>Hinc concussa fides, et multis utile bellum.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This same multis utile bellum, is an assured and

<P>infallible sign, of a state disposed to seditions and

<P>troubles.&nbsp; And if this poverty and broken estate in

<P>the better sort, be joined with a want and necessity

<P>in the mean people, the danger is imminent and

<P>great.&nbsp; For the rebellions of the belly are the worst.

<P>As for discontentments, they are, in the politic

<P>body, like to humors in the natural, which are apt

<P>to gather a preternatural heat, and to inflame.

<P>And let no prince measure the danger of them by

<P>this, whether they be just or unjust: for that were

<P>to imagine people, to be too reasonable; who do

<P>often spurn at their own good: nor yet by this,

<P>whether the griefs whereupon they rise, be in fact

<P>great or small: for they are the most dangerous

<P>discontentments, where the fear is greater than

<P>the feeling.&nbsp; Dolendi modus, timendi non item.

<P>Besides, in great oppressions, the same things that

<P>provoke the patience, do withal mate the courage;

<P>but in fears it is not so.&nbsp; Neither let any prince, or

<P>state, be secure concerning discontentments, be-

<P>cause they have been often, or have been long, and

<P>yet no peril hath ensued: for as it is true, that every

<P>vapor or fume doth not turn into a storm; so it is

<P>nevertheless true, that storms, though they blow

<P>over divers times, yet may fall at last; and, as the

<P>Spanish proverb noteth well, The cord breaketh at

<P>the last by the weakest pull.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The causes and motives of seditions are, innova-

<P>tion in religion; taxes; alteration of laws and cus-

<P>toms; breaking of privileges; general oppression;

<P>advancement of unworthy persons; strangers;

<P>dearths; disbanded soldiers; factions grown des-

<P>perate; and what soever, in offending people,

<P>joineth and knitteth them in a common cause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the remedies; there may be some general

<P>preservatives, whereof we will speak: as for the

<P>just cure, it must answer to the particular disease;

<P>and so be left to counsel, rather than rule.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first remedy or prevention is to remove, by

<P>all means possible, that material cause of sedition

<P>whereof we spake; which is, want and poverty in

<P>the estate.&nbsp; To which purpose serveth the opening,

<P>and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of

<P>manufactures; the banishing of idleness; the re-

<P>pressing of waste, and excess, by sumptuary laws;

<P>the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the

<P>regulating of prices of things vendible; the moder-

<P>ating of taxes and tributes; and the like.&nbsp; Generally,

<P>it is to be foreseen that the population of a king-

<P>dom (especially if it be not mown down by wars)

<P>do not exceed the stock of the kingdom, which

<P>should maintain them.&nbsp; Neither is the population

<P>to be reckoned only by number; for a smaller num-

<P>ber, that spend more and earn less, do wear out an

<P>estate sooner, than a greater number that live

<P>lower, and gather more.&nbsp; Therefore the multiply-

<P>ing of nobility, and other degrees of quality, in an

<P>over proportion to the common people, doth speed-

<P>ily bring a state to necessity; and so doth likewise

<P>an overgrown clergy; for they bring nothing to

<P>the stock; and in like manner, when more are bred

<P>scholars, than preferments can take off .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is likewise to be remembered, that forasmuch

<P>as the increase of any estate must be upon the

<P>foreigner (for whatsoever is somewhere gotten, is

<P>somewhere lost), there be but three things, which

<P>one nation selleth unto another; the commodity as

<P>nature yieldeth it; the manufacture; and the vec-

<P>ture, or carriage.&nbsp; So that if these three wheels go,

<P>wealth will flow as in a spring tide.&nbsp; And it cometh

<P>many times to pass, that materiam superabit opus;

<P>that the work and carriage is more worth than the

<P>material, and enricheth a state more; as is notably

<P>seen in the Low-Countrymen, who have the best

<P>mines above ground, in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Above all things, good policy is to be used, that

<P>the treasure and moneys, in a state, be not gath-

<P>ered into few hands.&nbsp; For otherwise a state may

<P>have a great stock, and yet starve.&nbsp; And money is

<P>like muck, not good except it be spread.&nbsp; This is

<P>done, chiefly by suppressing, or at least keeping

<P>a strait hand, upon the devouring trades of usury,

<P>ingrossing great pasturages, and the like.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For removing discontentments, or at least the

<P>danger of them; there is in every state (as we

<P>know) two portions of subjects; the noblesse and

<P>the commonalty.&nbsp; When one of these is discontent,

<P>the danger is not great; for common people are of

<P>slow motion, if they be not excited by the greater

<P>sort; and the greater sort are of small strength,

<P>except the multitude be apt, and ready to move of

<P>themselves.&nbsp; Then is the danger, when the greater

<P>sort, do but wait for the troubling of the waters

<P>amongst the meaner, that then they may declare

<P>themselves.&nbsp; The poets feign, that the rest of the

<P>gods would have bound Jupiter; which he hearing

<P>of, by the counsel of Pallas, sent for Briareus, with

<P>his hundred hands, to come in to his aid.&nbsp; An em-

<P>blem, no doubt, to show how safe it is for mon-

<P>archs, to make sure of the good will of common

<P>people.&nbsp; To give moderate liberty for griefs and dis-

<P>contentments to evaporate (so it be without too

<P>great insolency or bravery), is a safe way.&nbsp; For he

<P>that turneth the humors back, and maketh the

<P>wound bleed inwards, endangereth malign ulcers,

<P>and pernicious imposthumations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The part of Epimetheus mought well become

<P>Prometheus, in the case of discontentments: for

<P>there is not a better provision against them.&nbsp; Epime-

<P>theus, when griefs and evils flew abroad, at last

<P>shut the lid, and kept hope in the bottom of the

<P>vessel.&nbsp; Certainly, the politic and artificial nourish-

<P>ing, and entertaining of hopes, and carrying men

<P>from hopes to hopes, is one of the best antidotes

<P>against the poison of discontentments.&nbsp; And it is a

<P>certain sign of a wise government and proceeding,

<P>when it can hold men's hearts by hopes, when it

<P>cannot by satisfaction; and when it can handle

<P>things, in such manner, as no evil shall appear so

<P>peremptory, but that it hath some outlet of hope;

<P>which is the less hard to do, because both particu-

<P>lar persons and factions, are apt enough to flatter

<P>themselves, or at least to brave that, which they

<P>believe not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Also the foresight and prevention, that there be

<P>no likely or fit head, whereunto discontented per-

<P>sons may resort, and under whom they may join,

<P>is a known, but an excellent point of caution.&nbsp; I

<P>understand a fit head, to be one that hath great-

<P>ness and reputation; that hath confidence with

<P>the discontented party, and upon whom they turn

<P>their eyes; and that is thought discontented, in his

<P>own particular: which kind of persons, are either

<P>to be won, and reconciled to the state, and that in

<P>a fast and true manner; or to be fronted with some

<P>other, of the same party, that may oppose them,

<P>and so divide the reputation.&nbsp; Generally, the divid-

<P>ing and breaking, of all factions and combinations

<P>that are adverse to the state, and setting them at

<P>distance, or at least distrust, amongst themselves,

<P>is not one of the worst remedies.&nbsp; For it is a desper-

<P>ate case, if those that hold with the proceeding of

<P>the state, be full of discord and faction, and those

<P>that are against it, be entire and united.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I have noted, that some witty and sharp

<P>speeches, which have fallen from princes, have

<P>given fire to seditions.&nbsp; Caesar did himself infinite

<P>hurt in that speech, Sylla nescivit literas, non po-

<P>tuit dictare; for it did utterly cut off that hope,

<P>which men had entertained, that he would at one

<P>time or other give over his dictatorship.&nbsp; Galba un-

<P>did himself by that speech, legi a se militem, non

<P>emi; for it put the soldiers out of hope of the dona-

<P>tive.&nbsp; Probus likewise, by that speech, Si vixero,

<P>non opus erit amplius Romano imperio militibus;

<P>a speech of great despair for the soldiers.&nbsp; And

<P>many the like.&nbsp; Surely princes had need, in tender

<P>matters and ticklish times, to beware what they

<P>say; especially in these short speeches, which fly

<P>abroad like darts, and are thought to be shot out of

<P>their secret intentions.&nbsp; For as for large&nbsp; discourses,

<P>they are flat things, and not so much noted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lastly, let princes, against all events, not be

<P>without some great person, one or rather more, of

<P>military valor, near unto them, for the repressing

<P>of seditions in their beginnings.&nbsp; For without that,

<P>there useth to be more trepidation in court upon

<P>the first breaking out of troubles, than were fit.

<P>And the state runneth the danger of that which

<P>Tacitus saith; Atque is habitus animorum fuit, ut

<P>pessimum facinus auderent pauci, plures vellent,

<P>omnes paterentur.&nbsp; But let such military persons be

<P>assured, and well reputed of, rather than factious

<P>and popular; holding also good correspondence

<P>with the other great men in the state; or else the

<P>remedy, is worse than the disease.
