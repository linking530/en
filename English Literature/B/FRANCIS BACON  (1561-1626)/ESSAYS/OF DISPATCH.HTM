<P>AFFECTED dispatch is one of the most danger-

<P>ous things to business that can be.&nbsp; It is like

<P>that, which the physicians call predigestion, or

<P>hasty digestion; which is sure to fill the body full of

<P>crudities, and secret seeds of diseases.&nbsp; Therefore

<P>measure not dispatch, by the times of sitting, but

<P>by the advancement of the business.&nbsp; And as in

<P>races it is not the large stride or high lift that makes

<P>the speed; so in business, the keeping close to the

<P>matter, and not taking of it too much at once, pro-

<P>cureth dispatch.&nbsp; It is the care of some, only to come

<P>off speedily for the time; or to contrive some false

<P>periods of business, because they may seem men

<P>of dispatch.&nbsp; But it is one thing, to abbreviate by

<P>contracting, another by cutting off . And business

<P>so handled, at several sittings or meetings, goeth

<P>commonly backward and forward in an unsteady

<P>manner.&nbsp; I knew a wise man that had it for a by-

<P>word, when he saw men hasten to a conclusion,

<P>Stay a little, that we may&nbsp; make&nbsp; an&nbsp; end&nbsp; the&nbsp;
sooner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the other side, true dispatch is a rich thing.

<P>For time is the measure of business, as money is

<P>of wares; and business is bought at a dear hand,

<P>where there is small dispatch.&nbsp; The Spartans and

<P>Spaniards have been noted to be of small dispatch;

<P>Mi venga la muerte de Spagna; Let my death come

<P>from Spain; for then it will be sure to be long in

<P>coming.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Give good hearing to those, that give the first

<P>information in business; and rather direct them

<P>in the beginning, than interrupt them in the con-

<P>tinuance of their speeches; for he that is put out of

<P>his own order, will go forward and backward, and

<P>be more tedious, while he waits upon his memory,

<P>than he could have been, if he had gone on in his

<P>own course.&nbsp; But sometimes it is seen, that the

<P>moderator is more troublesome, than the actor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Iterations are commonly loss of time.&nbsp; But there

<P>is no such gain of time, as to iterate often the state

<P>of the question; for it chaseth away many a frivo-

<P>lous speech, as it is coming forth.&nbsp; Long and curious

<P>speeches, are as fit for dispatch, as a robe or mantle,

<P>with a long train, is for race.&nbsp; Prefaces and pas-

<P>sages, and excusations, and other speeches of refer-

<P>ence to the person, are great wastes of time; and

<P>though they seem to proceed of modesty, they are

<P>bravery.&nbsp; Yet beware of being too material, when

<P>there is any impediment or obstruction in men's

<P>wills; for pre-occupation of mind ever requireth

<P>preface of speech; like a fomentation to make the

<P>unguent enter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Above all things, order, and distribution, and

<P>singling out of parts, is the life of dispatch; so as the

<P>distribution be not too subtle: for he that doth not

<P>divide, will never enter well into business; and he

<P>that divideth too much, will never come out of it

<P>clearly.&nbsp; To choose time, is to save time; and an un-

<P>seasonable motion, is but beating the air.&nbsp; There be

<P>three parts of business; the preparation, the debate

<P>or examination, and the perfection.&nbsp; Whereof, if

<P>you look for dispatch, let the middle only be the

<P>work of many, and the first and last the work of

<P>few.&nbsp; The proceeding upon somewhat conceived in

<P>writing, doth for the most part facilitate dispatch:

<P>for though it should be wholly rejected, yet that

<P>negative is more pregnant of direction, than an

<P>indefinite; as ashes are more generative than dust.
