<P>MANY have made witty invectives against

<P>usury.&nbsp; They say that it is a pity, the devil

<P>should have God's part, which is the tithe.&nbsp; That the

<P>usurer is the greatest Sabbath-breaker, because his

<P>plough goeth every Sunday.&nbsp; That the usurer is the

<P>drone, that Virgil speaketh of;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That the usurer breaketh the first law, that was

<P>made for mankind after the fall, which was, in

<P>sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum; not, in

<P>sudore vultus alieni.&nbsp; That usurers should have

<P>orange-tawny bonnets, because they do judaize.

<P>That it is against nature for money to beget money;

<P>and the like.&nbsp; I say this only, that usury is a conces-

<P>sum propter duritiem cordis; for since there must

<P>be borrowing and lending, and men are so hard

<P>of heart, as they will not lend freely, usury must

<P>be permitted.&nbsp; Some others, have made suspicious

<P>and cunning propositions of banks, discovery of

<P>men's estates, and other inventions.&nbsp; But few have

<P>spoken of usury usefully.&nbsp; It is good to set before us,

<P>the incommodities and commodities of usury, that

<P>the good, may be either weighed out or culled out;

<P>and warily to provide, that while we make forth

<P>to that which is better, we meet not with that

<P>which is worse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The discommodities of usury are, First, that it

<P>makes fewer merchants.&nbsp; For were it not for this

<P>lazy trade of usury, money would not he still, but

<P>would in great part be employed upon merchan-

<P>dizing; which is the vena porta of wealth in a state.

<P>The second, that it makes poor merchants.&nbsp; For, as

<P>a farmer cannot husband his ground so well, if he

<P>sit at a great rent; so the merchant cannot drive

<P>his trade so well, if he sit at great usury.&nbsp; The third

<P>is incident to the other two; and that is the decay of

<P>customs of kings or states, which ebb or flow, with

<P>merchandizing.&nbsp; The fourth, that it bringeth the

<P>treasure of a realm, or state, into a few hands.&nbsp; For

<P>the usurer being at certainties, and others at uncer-

<P>tainties, at the end of the game, most of the money

<P>will be in the box; and ever a state flourisheth,

<P>when wealth is more equally spread.&nbsp; The fifth,

<P>that it beats down the price of land; for the em-

<P>ployment of money, is chiefly either merchandiz-

<P>ing or purchasing; and usury waylays both.&nbsp; The

<P>sixth, that it doth dull and damp all industries, im-

<P>provements, and new inventions, wherein money

<P>would be stirring, if it were not for this slug.&nbsp; The

<P>last, that it is the canker and ruin of many men's

<P>estates; which, in process of time, breeds a public

<P>poverty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the other side, the commodities of usury are,

<P>first, that howsoever usury in some respect hinder-

<P>eth merchandizing, yet in some other it advanceth

<P>it; for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is

<P>driven by young merchants, upon borrowing at

<P>interest; so as if the usurer either call in, or keep

<P>back, his money, there will ensue, presently, a

<P>great stand of trade.&nbsp; The second is, that were it not

<P>for this easy borrowing upon interest, men's neces-

<P>sities would draw upon them a most sudden un-

<P>doing; in that they would be forced to sell their

<P>means (be it lands or goods) far under foot; and so,

<P>whereas usury doth but gnaw upon them, bad

<P>markets would swallow them quite up.&nbsp; As for

<P>mortgaging or pawning, it will little mend the

<P>matter: for either men will not take pawns with-

<P>out use; or if they do, they will look precisely for

<P>the forfeiture.&nbsp; I remember a cruel moneyed man

<P>in the country, that would say, The devil take this

<P>usury, it keeps us from forfeitures, of mortgages

<P>and bonds.&nbsp; The third and last is, that it is a vanity

<P>to conceive, that there would be ordinary borrow-

<P>ing without profit; and it is impossible to conceive,

<P>the number of inconveniences that will ensue, if

<P>borrowing be cramped.&nbsp; Therefore to speak of the

<P>abolishing of usury is idle.&nbsp; All states have ever had

<P>it, in one kind or rate, or other.&nbsp; So as that opinion

<P>must be sent to Utopia.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To speak now of the reformation, and reigle-

<P>ment, of usury; how the discommodities of it may

<P>be best avoided, and the commodities retained.&nbsp; It

<P>appears, by the balance of commodities and dis-

<P>commodities of usury, two things are to be recon-

<P>ciled.&nbsp; The one, that the tooth of usury be grinded,

<P>that it bite not too much; the other, that there be

<P>left open a means, to invite moneyed men to lend

<P>to the merchants, for the continuing and quicken-

<P>ing of trade.&nbsp; This cannot be done, except you intro-

<P>duce two several sorts of usury, a less and a greater.

<P>For if you reduce usury to one low rate, it will ease

<P>the common borrower, but the merchant will be

<P>to seek for money.&nbsp; And it is to be noted, that the

<P>trade of merchandize, being the most lucrative,

<P>may bear usury at a good rate; other contracts

<P>not so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To serve both intentions, the way would be

<P>briefly thus.&nbsp; That there be two rates of usury:

<P>the one free, and general for all; the other under

<P>license only, to certain persons, and in certain

<P>places of merchandizing.&nbsp; First, therefore, let usury

<P>in general, be reduced to five in the hundred; and

<P>let that rate be proclaimed, to be free and current;

<P>and let the state shut itself out, to take any penalty

<P>for the same.&nbsp; This will preserve borrowing, from

<P>any general stop or dryness.&nbsp; This will ease infinite

<P>borrowers in the country.&nbsp; This will, in good part,

<P>raise the price of land, because land purchased

<P>at sixteen years' purchase will yield six in the

<P>hundred, and somewhat more; whereas this rate

<P>of interest, yields but five.&nbsp; This by like reason

<P>will encourage, and edge, industrious and profit-

<P>able improvements; because many will rather

<P>venture in that kind, than take five in the hun-

<P>dred, especially having been used to greater profit.

<P>Secondly, let there be certain persons licensed,

<P>to lend to known merchants, upon usury at a

<P>higher rate; and let it be with the cautions fol-

<P>lowing.&nbsp; Let the rate be, even with the merchant

<P>himself, somewhat more easy than that he used

<P>formerly to pay; for by that means, all bor-

<P>rowers, shall have some ease by this reformation,

<P>be he merchant, or whosoever.&nbsp; Let it be no

<P>bank or common stock, but every man be master

<P>of his own money.&nbsp; Not that I altogether mis-

<P>like banks, but they will hardly be brooked, in

<P>regard of certain suspicions.&nbsp; Let the state be

<P>answered some small matter for the license, and

<P>the rest left to the lender; for if the abatement be

<P>but small, it will no whit discourage the lender.

<P>For he, for example, that took before ten or nine in

<P>the hundred, will sooner descend to eight in the

<P>hundred than give over his trade of usury, and go

<P>from certain gains, to gains of hazard.&nbsp; Let these

<P>licensed lenders be in number indefinite, but re-

<P>strained to certain principal cities and towns of

<P>merchandizing; for then they will be hardly able

<P>to color other men's moneys in the country: so as

<P>the license of nine will not suck away the current

<P>rate of five; for no man will send his moneys far

<P>off, nor put them into unknown hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If it be objected that this doth in a sort authorize

<P>usury, which before, was in some places but per-

<P>missive; the answer is, that it is better to mitigate

<P>usury, by declaration, than to suffer it to rage, by

<P>connivance.
