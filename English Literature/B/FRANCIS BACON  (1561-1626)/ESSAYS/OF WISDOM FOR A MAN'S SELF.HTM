<P>AN ANT is a wise creature for itself, but it is a

<P>&nbsp;shrewd thing, in an orchard or garden.&nbsp; And

<P>certainly, men that are great lovers of themselves,

<P>waste the public.&nbsp; Divide with reason; between self-

<P>love and society; and be so true to thyself, as thou

<P>be not false to others; specially to thy king and

<P>country.&nbsp; It is a poor centre of a man's actions, him-

<P>self.&nbsp; It is right earth.&nbsp; For that only stands fast upon

<P>his own centre; whereas all things, that have af-

<P>finity with the heavens, move upon the centre of

<P>another, which they benefit.&nbsp; The referring of all

<P>to a man's self, is more tolerable in a sovereign

<P>prince; because themselves are not only them-

<P>selves, but their good and evil is at the peril of the

<P>public fortune.&nbsp; But it is a desperate evil, in a ser-

<P>vant to a prince, or a citizen in a republic.&nbsp; For

<P>whatsoever affairs pass such a man's hands, he

<P>crooketh them to his own ends; which must needs

<P>be often eccentric to the ends of his master, or state.

<P>Therefore, let princes, or states, choose such ser-

<P>vants, as have not this mark; except they mean

<P>their service should be made but the accessory.

<P>That which maketh the effect more pernicious, is

<P>that all proportion is lost.&nbsp; It were disproportion

<P>enough, for the servant's good to be preferred be-

<P>fore the master's; but yet it is a greater extreme,

<P>when a little good of the servant, shall carry things

<P>against a great good of the master's.&nbsp; And yet that

<P>is the case of bad officers, treasurers, ambassadors,

<P>generals, and other false and corrupt servants;

<P>which set a bias upon their bowl, of their own

<P>petty ends and envies, to the overthrow of their

<P>master's great and important affairs.&nbsp; And for the

<P>most part, the good such servants receive, is after

<P>the model of their own fortune; but the hurt they

<P>sell for that good, is after the model of their

<P>master's fortune.&nbsp; And certainly it is the nature of

<P>extreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire,

<P>and it were but to roast their eggs; and yet these

<P>men many times hold credit with their masters,

<P>because their study is but to please them, and profit

<P>themselves; and for either respect, they will aban-

<P>don the good of their affairs.

<P>Wisdom for a man's self is, in many branches

<P>thereof, a depraved thing.&nbsp; It is the wisdom of rats,

<P>that will be sure to leave a house, somewhat before

<P>it fall.&nbsp; It is the wisdom of the fox, that thrusts out

<P>the badger, who digged and made room for him.

<P>It is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears when

<P>they would devour.&nbsp; But that which is specially to

<P>be noted is, that those which (as Cicero says of

<P>Pompey) are sui amantes, sine rivali, are many

<P>times unfortunate.&nbsp; And whereas they have, all

<P>their times, sacrificed to themselves, they become

<P>in the end, themselves sacrifices to the inconstancy

<P>of fortune, whose wings they thought, by their

<P>self-wisdom, to have pinioned.
