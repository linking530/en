<P>I HAD rather believe all the fables in the Leg-

<P>end, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than

<P>that this universal frame is without a mind.

<P>And therefore, God never wrought miracle, to

<P>convince atheism, because his ordinary works con-

<P>vince it.&nbsp; It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth

<P>man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy

<P>bringeth men's minds about to religion.&nbsp; For while

<P>the mind of man looketh upon second causes scat-

<P>tered, it may sometimes rest in them, and go no

<P>further; but when it beholdeth the chain of them,

<P>confederate and linked together, it must needs fly

<P>to Providence and Deity.&nbsp; Nay, even that school

<P>which is most accused of atheism doth most dem-

<P>onstrate religion; that is, the school of Leucippus

<P>and Democritus and Epicurus.&nbsp; For it is a thousand

<P>times more credible, that four mutable elements,

<P>and one immutable fifth essence, duly and eter-

<P>nally placed, need no God, than that an army of

<P>infinite small portions, or seeds unplaced, should

<P>have produced this order and beauty, without a

<P>divine marshal.&nbsp; The Scripture saith, The fool hath

<P>said in his heart, there is no God; it is not said, The

<P>fool hath thought in his heart; so as he rather saith

<P>it, by rote to himself, as that he would have, than

<P>that he can thoroughly believe it, or be persuaded

<P>of it.&nbsp; For none deny, there is a God, but those, for

<P>whom it maketh that there were no God.&nbsp; It ap-

<P>peareth in nothing more, that atheism is rather in

<P>the lip, than in the heart of man, than by this; that

<P>atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion,

<P>as if they fainted in it, within themselves, and

<P>would be glad to be strengthened, by the consent

<P>of others.&nbsp; Nay more, you shall have atheists strive

<P>to get disciples, as it fareth with other sects.&nbsp; And,

<P>which is most of all, you shall have of them, that

<P>will suffer for atheism, and not recant; whereas if

<P>they did truly think, that there were no such thing

<P>as God, why should they trouble themselves? Epi-

<P>curus is charged, that he did but dissemble for his

<P>credit's sake, when he affirmed there were blessed

<P>natures, but such as enjoyed themselves, without

<P>having respect to the government of the world.

<P>Wherein they say he did temporize; though in

<P>secret, he thought there was no God.&nbsp; But certainly

<P>he is traduced; for his words are noble and divine:

<P>Non deos vulgi negare profanum; sed vulgi opini-

<P>ones diis applicare profanum.&nbsp; Plato could have

<P>said no more.&nbsp; And although he had the confidence,

<P>to deny the administration, he had not the power,

<P>to deny the nature.&nbsp; The Indians of the West, have

<P>names for their particular gods, though they have

<P>no name for God: as if the heathens should have

<P>had the names Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, etc., but not

<P>the word Deus; which shows that even those bar-

<P>barous people have the notion, though they have

<P>not the latitude and extent of it.&nbsp; So that against

<P>atheists, the very savages take part, with the very

<P>subtlest philosophers.&nbsp; The contemplative atheist is

<P>rare: a Diagoras, a Bion, a Lucian perhaps, and

<P>some others; and yet they seem to be more than

<P>they are; for that all that impugn a received re-

<P>ligion, or superstition, are by the adverse part

<P>branded with the name of atheists.&nbsp; But the great

<P>atheists, indeed are hypocrites; which are ever

<P>handling holy things, but without feeling; so as

<P>they must needs be cauterized in the end.&nbsp; The

<P>causes of atheism are: divisions in religion, if they

<P>be many; for any one main division, addeth zeal to

<P>both sides; but many divisions introduce atheism.

<P>Another is, scandal of priests; when it is come to

<P>that which St. Bernard saith, non est jam dicere,

<P>ut populus sic sacerdos; quia nec sic populus ut

<P>sacerdos.&nbsp; A third is, custom of profane scoffing in

<P>holy matters; which doth, by little and little, de-

<P>face the reverence of religion.&nbsp; And lastly, learned

<P>times, specially with peace and prosperity; for

<P>troubles and adversities do more bow men's minds

<P>to religion.&nbsp; They that deny a God, destroy man's

<P>nobility; for certainly man is of kin to the beasts,

<P>by his body; and, if he be not of kin to God, by his

<P>spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature.&nbsp; It destroys

<P>likewise magnanimity, and the raising of human

<P>nature; for take an example of a dog, and mark

<P>what a generosity and courage he will put on,

<P>when he finds himself maintained by a man; who

<P>to him is instead of a God, or melior natura; which

<P>courage is manifestly such, as that creature, with-

<P>out that confidence of a better nature than his own,

<P>could never attain.&nbsp; So man, when he resteth and

<P>assureth himself, upon divine protection and

<P>favor, gathered a force and faith, which human

<P>nature in itself could not obtain.&nbsp; Therefore, as

<P>atheism is in all respects hateful, so in this, that it

<P>depriveth human nature of the means to exalt it-

<P>self, above human frailty.&nbsp; As it is in particular

<P>persons, so it is in nations.&nbsp; Never was there such a

<P>state for magnanimity as Rome.&nbsp; Of this state hear

<P>what Cicero saith: Quam volumus licet, patres con-

<P>scripti, nos amemus, tamen nec numero Hispanos,

<P>nec robore Gallos, nec calliditate Poenos, nec arti-

<P>bus Graecos, nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis et

<P>terrae domestico nativoque sensu Italos ipsos et

<P>Latinos; sed pietate, ac religione, atque hac una

<P>sapientia, quod deorum immortalium numine

<P>omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus, omnes

<P>gentes nationesque superavimus.
