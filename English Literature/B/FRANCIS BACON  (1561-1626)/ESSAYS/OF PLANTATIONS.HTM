<P>PLANTATIONS are amongst ancient, primi-

<P>tive, and heroical works.&nbsp; When the world was

<P>young, it begat more children; but now it is old, it

<P>begets fewer: for I may justly account new plan-

<P>tations, to be the children of former kingdoms.&nbsp; I

<P>like a plantation in a pure soil; that is, where

<P>people are not displanted, to the end, to plant in

<P>others.&nbsp; For else it is rather an extirpation, than a

<P>plantation.&nbsp; Planting of countries, is like planting

<P>of woods; for you must make account to leese al-

<P>most twenty years' profit, and expect your recom-

<P>pense in the end.&nbsp; For the principal thing, that hath

<P>been the destruction of most plantations, hath

<P>been the base and hasty drawing of profit, in the

<P>first years.&nbsp; It is true, speedy profit is not to be neg-

<P>lected, as far as may stand with the good of the

<P>plantation, but no further.&nbsp; It is a shameful and

<P>unblessed thing, to take the scum of people, and

<P>wicked condemned men, to be the people with

<P>whom you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth

<P>the plantation; for they will ever live like rogues,

<P>and not fall to work, but be lazy, and do mischief,

<P>and spend victuals, and be quickly weary, and

<P>then certify over to their country, to the discredit

<P>of the plantation.&nbsp; The people wherewith you

<P>plant ought to be gardeners, ploughmen, laborers,

<P>smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers,

<P>with some few apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and

<P>bakers.&nbsp; In a country of plantation, first look about,

<P>what kind of victual the country yields of itself to

<P>hand; as chestnuts, walnuts, pineapples, olives,

<P>dates, plums, cherries, wild honey, and the like;

<P>and make use of them.&nbsp; Then consider what victual

<P>or esculent things there are, which grow speedily,

<P>and within the year; as parsnips, carrots, turnips,

<P>onions, radish, artichokes of Hierusalem, maize,

<P>and the like.&nbsp; For wheat, barley, and oats, they ask

<P>too much labor; but with pease and beans you may

<P>begin, both because they ask less labor, and be-

<P>cause they serve for meat, as well as for bread.&nbsp; And

<P>of rice, likewise cometh a great increase, and it is

<P>a kind of meat.&nbsp; Above all, there ought to be brought

<P>store of biscuit, oat-meal, flour, meal, and the like,

<P>in the beginning, till bread may be had.&nbsp; For beasts,

<P>or birds, take chiefly such as are least subject to

<P>diseases, and multiply fastest; as swine, goats,

<P>cocks, hens, turkeys, geese, house-doves, and the

<P>like.&nbsp; The victual in plantations, ought to be ex-

<P>pended almost as in a besieged town; that is, with

<P>certain allowance.&nbsp; And let the main part of the

<P>ground, employed to gardens or corn, be to a com-

<P>mon stock; and to be laid in, and stored up, and

<P>then delivered out in proportion; besides some

<P>spots of ground, that any particular person will

<P>manure for his own private.&nbsp; Consider likewise

<P>what commodities, the soil where the plantation

<P>is, doth naturally yield, that they may some way

<P>help to defray the charge of the plantation (so it be

<P>not, as was said, to the untimely prejudice of the

<P>main business), as it hath fared with tobacco in

<P>Virginia.&nbsp; Wood commonly aboundeth but too

<P>much; and therefore timber is fit to be one.&nbsp; If there

<P>be iron ore, and streams whereupon to set the mills,

<P>iron is a brave commodity where wood aboundeth.

<P>Making of bay-salt, if the climate be proper for it,

<P>would be put in experience.&nbsp; Growing silk likewise,

<P>if any be, is a likely commodity.&nbsp; Pitch and tar,

<P>where store of firs and pines are, will not fail.&nbsp; So

<P>drugs and sweet woods, where they are, cannot

<P>but yield great profit.&nbsp; Soap-ashes likewise, and

<P>other things that may be thought of.&nbsp; But moil not

<P>too much under ground; for the hope of mines is

<P>very uncertain, and useth to make the planters

<P>lazy, in other things.&nbsp; For government; let it be in

<P>the hands of one, assisted with some counsel; and

<P>let them have commission to exercise martial laws,

<P>with some limitation.&nbsp; And above all, let men make

<P>that profit, of being in the wilderness, as they have

<P>God always, and his service, before their eyes.&nbsp; Let

<P>not the government of the plantation, depend

<P>upon too many counsellors, and undertakers, in

<P>the country that planteth, but upon a temperate

<P>number; and let those be rather noblemen and

<P>gentlemen, than merchants; for they look ever to

<P>the present gain.&nbsp; Let there be freedom from cus-

<P>tom, till the plantation be of strength; and not

<P>only freedom from custom, but freedom to carry

<P>their commodities, where they may make their

<P>best of them, except there be some special cause of

<P>caution.&nbsp; Cram not in people, by sending too fast

<P>company after company; but rather harken how

<P>they waste, and send supplies proportionably; but

<P>so, as the number may live well in the plantation,

<P>and not by surcharge be in penury.&nbsp; It hath been a

<P>great endangering to the health of some planta-

<P>tions, that they have built along the sea and rivers,

<P>in marish and unwholesome grounds.&nbsp; Therefore,

<P>though you begin there, to avoid carriage and

<P>like discommodities, yet build still rather upwards

<P>from the streams, than along.&nbsp; It concerneth like-

<P>wise the health of the plantation, that they have

<P>good store of salt with them, that they may use it

<P>in their victuals, when it shall be necessary.&nbsp; If you

<P>plant where savages are, do not only entertain

<P>them, with trifles and gingles, but use them justly

<P>and graciously, with sufficient guard nevertheless;

<P>and do not win their favor, by helping them to in-

<P>vade their enemies, but for their defence it is not

<P>amiss; and send oft of them, over to the country

<P>that plants, that they may see a better condition

<P>than their own, and commend it when they re-

<P>turn.&nbsp; When the plantation grows to strength, then

<P>it is time to plant with women, as well as with

<P>men; that the plantation may spread into genera-

<P>tions, and not be ever pieced from without.&nbsp; It is the

<P>sinfullest thing in the world, to forsake or destitute

<P>a plantation once in forwardness; for besides the

<P>dishonor, it is the guiltiness of blood of many com-

<P>miserable persons.
