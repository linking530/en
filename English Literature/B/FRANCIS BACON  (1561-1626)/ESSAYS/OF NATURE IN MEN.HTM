<P>NATURE is often hidden; sometimes over-

<P>come; seldom extinguished.&nbsp; Force, maketh

<P>nature more violent in the return; doctrine and dis-

<P>course, maketh nature less importune; but custom

<P>only doth alter and subdue nature.&nbsp; He that seeketh

<P>victory over his nature, let him not set himself too

<P>great, nor too small tasks; for the first will make

<P>him dejected by often failings; and the second will

<P>make him a small proceeder, though by often pre-

<P>vailings.&nbsp; And at the first let him practise with

<P>helps, as swimmers do with bladders or rushes;

<P>but after a time let him practise with disadvan-

<P>tages, as dancers do with thick shoes.&nbsp; For it breeds

<P>great perfection, if the practice be harder than the

<P>use.&nbsp; Where nature is mighty, and therefore the

<P>victory hard, the degrees had need be, first to stay

<P>and arrest nature in time; like to him that would

<P>say over the four and twenty letters when he was

<P>angry; then to go less in quantity; as if one should,

<P>in forbearing wine, come from drinking healths,

<P>to a draught at a meal; and lastly, to discontinue

<P>altogether.&nbsp; But if a man have the fortitude, and

<P>resolution, to enfranchise himself at once, that is

<P>the best:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus

<P>Vincula qui rupit, dedoluitque semel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Neither is the ancient rule amiss, to bend nature,

<P>as a wand, to a contrary extreme, whereby to set it

<P>right, understanding it, where the contrary ex-

<P>treme is no vice.&nbsp; Let not a man force a habit upon

<P>himself, with a perpetual continuance, but with

<P>some intermission.&nbsp; For both the pause reinforceth

<P>the new onset; and if a man that is not perfect, be

<P>ever in practice, he shall as well practise his errors,

<P>as his abilities, and induce one habit of both; and

<P>there is no means to help this, but by seasonable

<P>intermissions.&nbsp; But let not a man trust his victory

<P>over his nature, too far; for nature will lay buried

<P>a great time, and yet revive, upon the occasion or

<P>temptation.&nbsp; Like as it was with AEsop's damsel,

<P>turned from a cat to a woman, who sat very de-

<P>mutely at the board's end, till a mouse ran before

<P>her.&nbsp; Therefore, let a man either avoid the occasion

<P>altogether; or put himself often to it, that he may

<P>be little moved with it.&nbsp; A man's nature is best per-

<P>ceived in privateness, for there is no affectation;

<P>in passion, for that putteth a man out of his pre-

<P>cepts; and in a new case or experiment, for there

<P>custom leaveth him.&nbsp; They are happy men, whose

<P>natures sort with their vocations; otherwise they

<P>may say, multum incola fuit anima mea; when

<P>they converse in those things, they do not affect.

<P>In studies, whatsoever a man commandeth upon

<P>himself, let him set hours for it; but whatsoever is

<P>agreeable to his nature, let him take no care for

<P>any set times; for his thoughts will fly to it, of

<P>themselves; so as the spaces of other business, or

<P>studies, will suffice.&nbsp; A man's nature, runs either to

<P>herbs or weeds; therefore let him seasonably water

<P>the one, and destroy the other.
