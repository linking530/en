<P>COSTLY followers are not to be liked; lest

<P>while a man maketh his train longer, he

<P>make his wings shorter.&nbsp; I reckon to be costly, not

<P>them alone which charge the purse, but which are

<P>wearisome, and importune in suits.&nbsp; Ordinary fol-

<P>lowers ought to challenge no higher conditions,

<P>than countenance, recommendation, and protec-

<P>tion from wrongs.&nbsp; Factious followers are worse to

<P>be liked, which follow not upon affection to him,

<P>with whom they range themselves, but upon

<P>discontentment conceived against some other;

<P>whereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelli-

<P>gence, that we many times see between great per-

<P>sonages.&nbsp; Likewise glorious followers, who make

<P>themselves as trumpets of the commendation of

<P>those they follow, are full of inconvenience; for

<P>they taint business through want of secrecy; and

<P>they export honor from a man, and make him a

<P>return in envy.&nbsp; There is a kind of followers like-

<P>wise, which are dangerous, being indeed espials;

<P>which inquire the secrets of the house, and bear

<P>tales of them, to others.&nbsp; Yet such men, many times,

<P>are in great favor; for they are officious, and com-

<P>monly exchange tales.&nbsp; The following by certain

<P>estates of men, answerable to that, which a great

<P>person himself professeth (as of soldiers, to him

<P>that hath been employed in the wars, and the like),

<P>hath ever been a thing civil, and well taken, even

<P>in monarchies; so it be without too much pomp

<P>or popularity.&nbsp; But the most honorable kind of fol-

<P>lowing, is to be followed as one, that apprehendeth

<P>to advance virtue, and desert, in all sorts of per-

<P>sons.&nbsp; And yet, where there is no eminent odds in

<P>sufficiency, it is better to take with the more pass-

<P>able, than with the more able.&nbsp; And besides, to

<P>speak truth, in base times, active men are of more

<P>use than virtuous.&nbsp; It is true that in government, it

<P>is good to use men of one rank equally: for to coun-

<P>tenance some extraordinarily, is to make them

<P>insolent, and the rest discontent; because they

<P>may claim a due.&nbsp; But contrariwise, in favor, to

<P>use men with much difference and election is

<P>good; for it maketh the persons preferred more

<P>thankful, and the rest more officious: because all is

<P>of favor.&nbsp; It is good discretion, not to make too much

<P>of any man at the first; because one cannot hold

<P>out that proportion.&nbsp; To be governed (as we call it)

<P>by one is not safe; for it shows softness, and gives

<P>a freedom, to scandal and disreputation; for those,

<P>that would not censure or speak ill of a man imme-

<P>diately, will talk more boldly of those that are so

<P>great with them, and thereby wound their honor.

<P>Yet to be distracted with many is worse; for it

<P>makes men to be of the last impression, and full of

<P>change.&nbsp; To take advice of some few friends, is ever

<P>honorable; for lookers-on many times see more

<P>than gamesters; and the vale best discovereth the

<P>hill.&nbsp; There is little friendship in the world, and least

<P>of all between equals, which was wont to be mag-

<P>nified.&nbsp; That that is, is between superior and in-

<P>ferior, whose fortunes may comprehend the one

<P>the other.
