<P>RICHES are for spending, and spending for

<P>honor and good actions.&nbsp; Therefore extra-

<P>ordinary expense must be limited by the worth of

<P>the occasion; for voluntary undoing, may be as

<P>well for a man's country, as for the kingdom of

<P>heaven.&nbsp; But ordinary expense, ought to be limited

<P>by a man's estate; and governed with such regard,

<P>as it be within his compass; and not subject to de-

<P>ceit and abuse of servants; and ordered to the best

<P>show, that the bills may be less than the estima-

<P>tion abroad.&nbsp; Certainly, if a man will keep but of

<P>even hand, his ordinary expenses ought to be but

<P>to the half of his receipts; and if he think to wax

<P>rich, but to the third part.&nbsp; It is no baseness, for the

<P>greatest to descend and look into their own estate.

<P>Some forbear it, not upon negligence alone, but

<P>doubting to bring themselves into melancholy, in

<P>respect they shall find it broken.&nbsp; But wounds can-

<P>not be cured without searching.&nbsp; He that cannot

<P>look into his own estate at all, had need both choose

<P>well those whom he employeth, and change them

<P>often; for new are more timorous and less subtle.

<P>He that can look into his estate but seldom, it be-

<P>hooveth him to turn all to certainties.&nbsp; A man had

<P>need, if he be plentiful in some kind of expense, to

<P>be as saving again in some other.&nbsp; As if he be plenti-

<P>ful in diet, to be saving in apparel; if he be plenti-

<P>ful in the hall, to be saving in the stable; and the

<P>like.&nbsp; For he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds,

<P>will hardly be preserved from decay.&nbsp; In clearing

<P>of a man's estate, he may as well hurt himself in

<P>being too sudden, as in letting it run on too long.

<P>For hasty selling, is commonly as disadvantage-

<P>able as interest.&nbsp; Besides, he that clears at once will

<P>relapse; for finding himself out of straits, he will

<P>revert to his custom: but he that cleareth by de-

<P>grees, induceth a habit of frugality, and gaineth

<P>as well upon his mind, as upon his estate.&nbsp; Cer-

<P>tainly, who hath a state to repair, may not despise

<P>small things; and commonly it is less dishonor-

<P>able, to abridge petty charges, than to stoop to

<P>petty gettings.&nbsp; A man ought warily to begin

<P>charges which once begun will continue; but in

<P>matters that return not, he may be more magnificent.
