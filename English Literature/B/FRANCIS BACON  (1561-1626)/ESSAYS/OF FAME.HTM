<P>THE poets make Fame a monster.&nbsp; They de-

<P>scribe her in part finely and elegantly, and

<P>in part gravely and sententiously.&nbsp; They say, look

<P>how many feathers she hath, so many eyes she

<P>hath underneath; so many tongues; so many

<P>voices; she pricks up so many ears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This is a flourish.&nbsp; There follow excellent par-

<P>ables; as that, she gathereth strength in going;

<P>that she goeth upon the ground, and yet hideth her

<P>head in the clouds; that in the daytime she sitteth

<P>in a watch tower, and flieth most by night; that

<P>she mingleth things done, with things not done;

<P>and that she is a terror to great cities.&nbsp; But that

<P>which passeth all the rest is: They do recount that

<P>the Earth, mother of the giants that made war

<P>against Jupiter, and were by him destroyed, there-

<P>upon in an anger brought forth Fame.&nbsp; For certain

<P>it is, that rebels, figured by the giants, and seditious

<P>fames and libels, are but brothers and sisters, mas-

<P>culine and feminine.&nbsp; But now, if a man can tame

<P>this monster, and bring her to feed at the hand,

<P>and govern her, and with her fly other ravening

<P>fowl and kill them, it is somewhat worth.&nbsp; But we

<P>are infected with the style of the poets.&nbsp; To speak

<P>now in a sad and serious manner: There is not, in

<P>all the politics, a place less handled and more

<P>worthy to be handled, than this of fame.&nbsp; We will

<P>therefore speak of these points: What are false

<P>fames; and what are true fames; and how they

<P>may be best discerned; how fames may be sown,

<P>and raised; how they may be spread, and multi-

<P>plied; and how they may be checked, and laid

<P>dead.&nbsp; And other things concerning the nature of

<P>fame.&nbsp; Fame is of that force, as there is scarcely any

<P>great action, wherein it hath not a great part; es-

<P>pecially in the war.&nbsp; Mucianus undid Vitellius, by

<P>a fame that he scattered, that Vitellius had in pur-

<P>pose to remove the legions of Syria into Germany,

<P>and the legions of Germany into Syria; where-

<P>upon the legions of Syria were infinitely inflamed.

<P>Julius Caesar took Pompey unprovided, and laid

<P>asleep his industry and preparations, by a fame

<P>that he cunningly gave out: Caesar's own soldiers

<P>loved him not, and being wearied with the wars,

<P>and laden with the spoils of Gaul, would forsake

<P>him, as soon as he came into Italy.&nbsp; Livia settled

<P>all things for the succession of her son Tiberius, by

<P>continual giving out, that her husband Augustus

<P>was upon recovery and amendment, and it is an

<P>usual thing with the pashas, to conceal the death

<P>of the Great Turk from the janizaries and men of

<P>war, to save the sacking of Constantinople and

<P>other towns, as their manner is.&nbsp; Themistocles made

<P>Xerxes, king of Persia, post apace out of Grecia, by

<P>giving out, that the Grecians had a purpose to

<P>break his bridge of ships, which he had made ath-

<P>wart Hellespont.&nbsp; There be a thousand such like

<P>examples; and the more they are, the less they

<P>need to be repeated; because a man meeteth with

<P>them everywhere.&nbsp; Therefore let all wise governors

<P>have as great a watch and care over fames, as they

<P>have of the actions and designs themselves.
