<P>DEFORMED persons are commonly even with

<P>nature; for as nature hath done ill by them,

<P>so do they by nature; being for the most part (as

<P>the Scripture saith) void of natural affection; and

<P>so they have their revenge of nature.&nbsp; Certainly

<P>there is a consent, between the body and the mind;

<P>and where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth

<P>in the other.&nbsp; Ubi peccat in uno, periclitatur in al-

<P>tero.&nbsp; But because there is, in man, an election

<P>touching the frame of his mind, and a necessity in

<P>the frame of his body, the stars of natural inclina-

<P>tion are sometimes obscured, by the sun of disci-

<P>pline and virtue.&nbsp; Therefore it is good to consider of

<P>deformity, not as a sign, which is more deceivable;

<P>but as a cause, which seldom faileth of the effect.

<P>Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person, that

<P>doth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur

<P>in himself, to rescue and deliver himself from

<P>scorn.&nbsp; Therefore all deformed persons, are extreme

<P>bold.&nbsp; First, as in their own defence, as being ex-

<P>posed to scorn; but in process of time, by a general

<P>habit.&nbsp; Also it stirreth in them industry, and espe-

<P>cially of this kind, to watch and observe the weak-

<P>ness of others, that they may have somewhat to

<P>repay.&nbsp; Again, in their superiors, it quencheth

<P>jealousy towards them, as persons that they think

<P>they may, at pleasure, despise: and it layeth their

<P>competitors and emulators asleep; as never believ-

<P>ing they should be in possibility of advancement,

<P>till they see them in possession.&nbsp; So that upon the

<P>matter, in a great wit, deformity is an advantage

<P>to rising.&nbsp; Kings in ancient times (and at this pres-

<P>ent in some countries) were wont to put great trust

<P>in eunuchs; because they that are envious towards

<P>all are more obnoxious and officious, towards one.

<P>But yet their trust towards them, hath rather

<P>been as to good spials, and good wbisperers, than

<P>good magistrates and officers.&nbsp; And much like is

<P>the reason of deformed persons.&nbsp; Still the ground

<P>is, they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free them-

<P>selves from scorn; which must be either by virtue

<P>or malice; and therefore let it not be marvelled, if

<P>sometimes they prove excellent persons; as was

<P>Agesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, AEsop,

<P>Gasca, President of Peru; and Socrates may go

<P>likewise amongst them; with others.
