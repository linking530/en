<P>VIRTUE is like a rich stone, best plain set; and

<P>surely virtue is best, in a body that is comely,

<P>though not of delicate features; and that hath

<P>rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.

<P>Neither is it almost seen, that very beautiful per-

<P>sons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were

<P>rather busy, not to err, than in labor to produce

<P>excellency.&nbsp; And therefore they prove accom-

<P>plished, but not of great spirit; and study rather

<P>behavior, than virtue.&nbsp; But this holds not always:

<P>for Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasianus, Philip le

<P>Belle of France, Edward the Fourth of England,

<P>Alcibiades of Athens, Ismael the Sophy of Persia,

<P>were all high and great spirits; and yet the most

<P>beautiful men of their times.&nbsp; In beauty, that of

<P>favor, is more than that of color; and that of decent

<P>and gracious motion, more than that of favor.&nbsp; That

<P>is the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot

<P>express; no, nor the first sight of the life.&nbsp; There is no

<P>excellent beauty, that hath not some strangeness

<P>in the proportion.&nbsp; A man cannot tell whether

<P>Apelles, or Albert Durer, were the more trifler;

<P>whereof the one, would make a personage by geo-

<P>metrical proportions; the other, by taking the best

<P>parts out of divers faces, to make one excellent.

<P>Such personages, I think, would please nobody,

<P>but the painter that made them.&nbsp; Not but I think a

<P>painter may make a better face than ever was; but

<P>he must do it by a kind of felicity (as a musician

<P>that maketh an excellent air in music), and not by

<P>rule.&nbsp; A man shall see faces, that if you examine

<P>them part by part, you shall find never a good;

<P>and yet altogether do well.&nbsp; If it be true that the

<P>principal part of beauty is in decent motion, cer-

<P>tainly it is no marvel, though persons in years

<P>seem many times more amiable; pulchrorum

<P>autumnus pulcher; for no youth can be comely

<P>but by pardon, and considering the youth, as to

<P>make up the comeliness.&nbsp; Beauty is as summer

<P>fruits,) which are easy to corrupt, and cannot last;

<P>and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth,

<P>and an age a little out of countenance; but yet cer-

<P>tainly again, if it light well, it maketh virtue shine,

<P>and vices blush.
