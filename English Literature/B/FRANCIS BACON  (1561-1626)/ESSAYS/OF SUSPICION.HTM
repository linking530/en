<P>SUSPICIONS amongst thoughts, are like bats

<P>amongst birds, they ever fly by twilight.&nbsp; Cer-

<P>tainly they are to be repressed, or at least well

<P>guarded: for they cloud the mind; they leese

<P>friends; and they check with business, whereby

<P>business cannot go on currently and constantly.

<P>They dispose kings to tyranny, husbands to jeal-

<P>ousy, wise men to irresolution and melancholy.

<P>They are defects, not in the heart, but in the brain;

<P>for they take place in the stoutest natures; as in the

<P>example of Henry the Seventh of England.&nbsp; There

<P>was not a more suspicious man, nor a more stout.

<P>And in such a composition they do small hurt.&nbsp; For

<P>commonly they are not admitted, but with exami-

<P>nation, whether they be likely or no.&nbsp; But in fearful

<P>natures they gain ground too fast.&nbsp; There is nothing

<P>makes a man suspect much, more than to know

<P>little; and therefore men should remedy suspicion,

<P>by procuring to know more, and not to keep their

<P>suspicions in smother.&nbsp; What would men have? Do

<P>they think, those they&nbsp; employ and deal with, are

<P>saints? Do they not think, they will have their own

<P>ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?

<P>Therefore there is no better way, to moderate sus-

<P>picions, than to account upon such suspicions as

<P>true, and yet to bridle them as false.&nbsp; For so far a

<P>man ought to make use of suspicions, as to provide,

<P>as if that should be true, that he suspects, yet it

<P>may do him no hurt.&nbsp; Suspicions that the mind of

<P>itself gathers, are but buzzes; but suspicions that

<P>are artificially nourished, and put into men's

<P>heads, by the tales and whisperings of others, have

<P>stings.&nbsp; Certainly, the best mean, to clear the way

<P>in this same wood of suspicions, is frankly to com-

<P>municate them with the party, that he suspects;

<P>for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the

<P>truth of them, than he did before; and withal shall

<P>make that party more circumspect, not to give

<P>further cause of suspicion.&nbsp; But this would not be

<P>done to men of base natures; for they, if they find

<P>themselves once suspected, will never be true.&nbsp; The

<P>Italian says, Sospetto licentia fede; as if suspicion,

<P>did give a passport to faith; but it ought, rather, to

<P>kindle it to discharge itself.
