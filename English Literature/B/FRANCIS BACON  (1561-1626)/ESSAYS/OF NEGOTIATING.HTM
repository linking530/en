<P>IT IS generally better to deal by speech than by

<P>letter; and by the mediation of a third than by

<P>a man's self.&nbsp; Letters are good, when a man would

<P>draw an answer by letter back again; or when it

<P>may serve for a man's justification afterwards to

<P>produce his own letter; or where it may be danger

<P>to be interrupted, or heard by pieces.&nbsp; To deal in

<P>person is good, when a man's face breedeth regard,

<P>as commonly with inferiors; or in tender cases,

<P>where a man's eye, upon the countenance of him

<P>with whom he speaketh, may give him a direction

<P>how far to go; and generally, where a man will

<P>reserve to himself liberty, either to disavow or to

<P>expound.&nbsp; In choice of instruments, it is better to

<P>choose men of a plainer sort, that are like to do

<P>that, that is committed to them, and to report back

<P>again faithfully the success, than those that are

<P>cunning, to contrive, out of other men's business,

<P>somewhat to grace themselves, and will help the

<P>matter in report for satisfaction's sake.&nbsp; Use also

<P>such persons as affect the business, wherein they

<P>are employed; for that quickeneth much; and

<P>such, as are fit for the matter; as bold men for ex-

<P>postulation, fair-spoken men for persuasion, crafty

<P>men for inquiry and observation, froward, and

<P>absurd men, for business that doth not well bear

<P>out itself.&nbsp; Use also such as have been lucky, and

<P>prevailed before, in things wherein you have em-

<P>ployed them; for that breeds confidence, and they

<P>will strive to maintain their prescription.&nbsp; It is bet-

<P>ter to sound a person, with whom one deals afar

<P>off, than to fall upon the point at first; except you

<P>mean to surprise him by some short question.&nbsp; It is

<P>better dealing with men in appetite, than with

<P>those that are where they would be.&nbsp; If a man deal

<P>with another upon conditions, the start or first per-

<P>formance is all; which a man cannot reasonably

<P>demand, except either the nature of the thing be

<P>such, which must go before; or else a man can

<P>persuade the other party, that he shall still need

<P>him in some other thing; or else that he be counted

<P>the honester man.&nbsp; All practice is to discover, or to

<P>work.&nbsp; Men discover themselves in trust, in passion,

<P>at unawares, and of necessity, when they would

<P>have somewhat done, and cannot find an apt pre-

<P>text.&nbsp; If you would work any man, you must either

<P>know his nature and fashions, and so lead him; or

<P>his ends, and so persuade him; or his weakness and

<P>disadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have

<P>interest in him, and so govern him.&nbsp; In dealing with

<P>cunning persons,we must ever consider their ends,

<P>to interpret their speeches; and it is good to say

<P>little to them, and that which they least look for.

<P>In all negotiations of difficulty, a man may not

<P>look to sow and reap at once; but must prepare

<P>business, and so ripen it by degrees.
