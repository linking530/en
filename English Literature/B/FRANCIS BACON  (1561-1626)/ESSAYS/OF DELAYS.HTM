<P>FORTUNE is like the market; where many

<P>times if you can stay a little, the price will fall.

<P>Again, it is sometimes like Sibylla's offer; which at

<P>first, offereth the commodity at full, then con-

<P>sumeth part and part, and still holdeth up the

<P>price.&nbsp; For occasion (as it is in the common verse)

<P>turneth a bald noddle, after she hath presented her

<P>locks in front, and no hold taken; or at least turneth

<P>the handle of the bottle, first to be received, and

<P>after the belly, which is hard to clasp.&nbsp; There is

<P>surely no greater wisdom, than well to time the

<P>beginnings, and onsets, of things.&nbsp; Dangers are no

<P>more light, if they once seem light; and more dan-

<P>gers have deceived men, than forced them.&nbsp; Nay,

<P>it were better, to meet some dangers half way,

<P>though they come nothing near, than to keep too

<P>long a watch upon their approaches; for if a man

<P>watch too long, it is odds he will fall asleep.&nbsp; On the

<P>other side, to be deceived with too long shadows

<P>(as some have been, when the moon was low, and

<P>shone on their enemies' back), and so to shoot off

<P>before the time; or to teach dangers to come on, by

<P>over early buckling towards them; is another ex-

<P>treme.&nbsp; The ripeness, or unripeness, of the occasion

<P>(as we said) must ever be well weighed; and gener-

<P>ally it is good, to commit the beginnings of all

<P>great actions to Argus, with his hundred eyes, and

<P>the ends to Briareus, with his hundred hands; first

<P>to watch, and then to speed.&nbsp; For the helmet of

<P>Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible,

<P>is secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execu-

<P>tion.&nbsp; For when things are once come to the execu-

<P>tion, there is no secrecy, comparable to celerity;

<P>like the motion of a bullet in the air, which flieth

<P>so swift, as it outruns the eye.
