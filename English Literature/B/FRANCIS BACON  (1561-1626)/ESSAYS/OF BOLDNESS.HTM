<P>IT IS a trivial grammar-school text, but yet

<P>worthy a wise man's consideration.&nbsp; Question

<P>was asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief

<P>part of an orator? he answered, action; what next?

<P>action; what next again? action.&nbsp; He said it, that

<P>knew it best, and had, by nature, himself no ad-

<P>vantage in that he commended.&nbsp; A strange thing,

<P>that that part of an orator, which is but superficial,

<P>and rather the virtue of a player, should be placed

<P>so high, above those other noble parts, of invention,

<P>elocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it

<P>were all in all.&nbsp; But the reason is plain.&nbsp; There is in

<P>human nature generally, more of the fool than of

<P>the wise; and therefore those faculties, by which

<P>the foolish part of men's minds is taken, are most

<P>potent.&nbsp; Wonderful like is the case of boldness in

<P>civil business: what first? boldness; what second

<P>and third? boldness.&nbsp; And yet boldness is a child of

<P>ignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts.

<P>But nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand

<P>and foot, those that are either shallow in judg-

<P>ment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest

<P>part; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak

<P>times.&nbsp; Therefore we see it hath done wonders, in

<P>popular states; but with senates, and princes less;

<P>and more ever upon the first entrance of bold per-

<P>sons into action, than soon after; for boldness is an

<P>ill keeper of promise.&nbsp; Surely, as there are mounte-

<P>banks for the natural body, so are there mounte-

<P>banks for the politic body; men that undertake

<P>great cures, and perhaps have been lucky, in two

<P>or three experiments, but want the grounds of

<P>science, and therefore cannot hold out.&nbsp; Nay, you

<P>shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet's

<P>miracle.&nbsp; Mahomet made the people believe that

<P>he would call an hill to him, and from the top of it

<P>offer up his prayers, for the observers of his law.

<P>The people assembled; Mahomet called the hill to

<P>come to him, again and again; and when the hill

<P>stood still, he was never a whit abashed, but said,

<P>If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet

<P>will go to the hill.&nbsp; So these men, when they have

<P>promised great matters, and failed most shame-

<P>fully, yet (if they have the perfection of boldness)

<P>they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and

<P>no more ado.&nbsp; Certainly to men of great judgment,

<P>bold persons are a sport to behold; nay, and to the

<P>vulgar also, boldness has somewhat of the ridicu-

<P>lous.&nbsp; For if absurdity be the subject of laughter,

<P>doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without

<P>some absurdity.&nbsp; Especially it is a sport to see, when

<P>a bold fellow is out of countenance; for that puts

<P>his face into a most shrunken, and wooden pos-

<P>ture; as needs it must; for in bashfulness, the spirits

<P>do a little go and come; but with bold men, upon

<P>like occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at

<P>chess, where it is no mate, but yet the game cannot

<P>stir.&nbsp; But this last were fitter for a satire than for a

<P>serious observation.&nbsp; This is well to be weighed;

<P>that boldness is ever blind; for it seeth not danger,

<P>and inconveniences.&nbsp; Therefore it is ill in counsel,

<P>good in execution; so that the right use of bold per-

<P>sons is, that they never command in chief, but be

<P>seconds, and under the direction of others.&nbsp; For in

<P>counsel, it is good to see dangers; and in execution,

<P>not to see them, except they be very great.
