<P>IT WAS an high speech of Seneca (after the

<P>manner of the Stoics), that the good things,

<P>which belong to prosperity, are to be wished; but

<P>the good things, that belong to adversity, are to be

<P>admired.&nbsp; Bona rerum secundarum optabilia; ad-

<P>versarum mirabilia.&nbsp; Certainly if miracles be the

<P>command over nature, they appear most in adver-

<P>sity.&nbsp; It is yet a higher speech of his, than the other

<P>(much too high for a heathen), It is true greatness,

<P>to have in one the frailty of a man, and the security

<P>of a God.&nbsp; Vere magnum habere fragilitatem homi-

<P>nis, securitatem Dei.&nbsp; This would have done better

<P>in poesy, where transcendences are more allowed.

<P>And the poets indeed have been busy with it; for

<P>it is in effect the thing, which figured in that

<P>strange fiction of the ancient poets, which seemeth

<P>not to be without mystery; nay, and to have some

<P>approach to the state of a Christian; that Hercules,

<P>when he went to unbind Prometheus (by whom

<P>human nature is represented), sailed the length of

<P>the great ocean, in an earthen pot or pitcher; lively

<P>describing Christian resolution, that saileth in the

<P>frail bark of the flesh, through the waves of the

<P>world.&nbsp; But to speak in a mean.&nbsp; The virtue of pros-

<P>perity, is temperance; the virtue of adversity, is

<P>fortitude; which in morals is the more heroical

<P>virtue.&nbsp; Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testa-

<P>ment; adversity is the blessing of the New; which

<P>carrieth the greater benediction, and the clearer

<P>revelation of God's favor.&nbsp; Yet even in the Old

<P>Testament, if you listen to David's harp, you shall

<P>hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the

<P>pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in de-

<P>scribing the afflictions of Job, than the felicities of

<P>Solomon.&nbsp; Prosperity is not without many fears

<P>and distastes; and adversity is not without com-

<P>forts and hopes.&nbsp; We see in needle-works and em-

<P>broideries, it is more pleasing to have a lively work,

<P>upon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark

<P>and melancholy work, upon a lightsome ground:

<P>judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart, by the

<P>pleasure of the eye.&nbsp; Certainly virtue is like precious

<P>odors, most fragrant when they are incensed, or

<P>crushed: for prosperity doth best discover vice, but

<P>adversity doth best discover virtue.
