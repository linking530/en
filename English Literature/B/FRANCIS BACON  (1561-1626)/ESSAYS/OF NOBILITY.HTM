<P>WE WILL speak of nobility, first as a portion

<P>of an estate, then as a condition of particu-

<P>lar persons.&nbsp; A monarchy, where there is no nobil-

<P>ity at all, is ever a pure and absolute tyranny; as

<P>that of the Turks.&nbsp; For nobility attempers sover-

<P>eignty, and draws the eyes of the people, somewhat

<P>aside from the line royal.&nbsp; But for democracies,

<P>they need it not; and they are commonly more

<P>quiet, and less subject to sedition, than where there

<P>are stirps of nobles.&nbsp; For men's eyes are upon the

<P>business, and not upon the persons; or if upon the

<P>persons, it is for the business' sake, as fittest, and

<P>not for flags and pedigree.&nbsp; We see the Switzers last

<P>well, notwithstanding their diversity of religion,

<P>and of cantons.&nbsp; For utility is their bond, and not

<P>respects.&nbsp; The united provinces of the Low Coun-

<P>tries, in their government, excel; for where there

<P>is an equality, the consultations are more indif-

<P>ferent, and the payments and tributes, more

<P>cheerful.&nbsp; A great and potent nobility, addeth

<P>majesty to a monarch, but diminisheth power;

<P>and putteth life and spirit into the people, but

<P>presseth their fortune.&nbsp; It is well, when nobles are

<P>not too great for sovereignty nor for justice; and

<P>yet maintained in that height, as the insolency of

<P>inferiors may be broken upon them, before it come

<P>on too fast upon the majesty of kings.&nbsp; A numerous

<P>nobility causeth poverty, and inconvenience in a

<P>state; for it is a surcharge of expense; and besides,

<P>it being of necessity, that many of the nobility fall,

<P>in time, to be weak in fortune, it maketh a kind of

<P>disproportion, between honor and means.

<P>As for nobility in particular persons; it is a rev-

<P>erend thing, to see an ancient castle or building,

<P>not in decay; or to see a fair timber tree, sound and

<P>perfect.&nbsp; How much more, to behold an ancient

<P>noble family, which has stood against the waves

<P>and weathers of time! For new nobility is but the

<P>act of power, but ancient nobility is the act of time.

<P>Those that are first raised to nobility, are com-

<P>monly more virtuous, but less innocent, than their

<P>descendants; for there is rarely any rising, but by

<P>a commixture of good and evil arts.&nbsp; But it is reason,

<P>the memory of their virtues remain to their pos-

<P>terity, and their faults die with themselves.&nbsp; Nobil-

<P>ity of birth commonly abateth industry; and he

<P>that is not industrious, envieth him that is.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>noble persons cannot go much higher; and he that

<P>standeth at a stay, when others rise, can hardly

<P>avoid motions of envy.&nbsp; On the other side, nobil-

<P>ity extinguisheth the passive envy from others,

<P>towards them; because they are in possession of

<P>honor.&nbsp; Certainly, kings that have able men of

<P>their nobility, shall find ease in employing them,

<P>and a better slide into their business; for people

<P>naturally bend to them, as born in some sort to

<P>command.
