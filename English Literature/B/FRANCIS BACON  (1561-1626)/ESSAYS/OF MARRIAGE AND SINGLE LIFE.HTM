<P>HE THAT hath wife and children hath given

<P>hostages to fortune; for they are impedi-

<P>ments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mis-

<P>chief.&nbsp; Certainly&nbsp; the&nbsp; best&nbsp; works,&nbsp; and&nbsp;
of&nbsp; greatest

<P>merit for the&nbsp; public,&nbsp; have&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; from&nbsp;
the&nbsp; un-

<P>married or childless men; which both in affection

<P>and means, have married and endowed the public.

<P>Yet it were great reason that those that have chil-

<P>dren, should have greatest care of future times;

<P>unto which they know they must transmit their

<P>dearest pledges.&nbsp; Some there are, who though they

<P>lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with

<P>themselves, and account future times imperti-

<P>nences.&nbsp; Nay, there are some other, that account

<P>wife and children, but as bills of charges.&nbsp; Nay

<P>more, there are some foolish rich covetous men,

<P>that take a pride, in having no children, because

<P>they may be thought so much the richer.&nbsp; For per-

<P>haps they have heard some talk, Such an one is a

<P>great rich man, and another except to it, Yea, but

<P>he hath a great charge of children; as if it were an

<P>abatement to his riches.&nbsp; But the most ordinary

<P>cause of a single life, is liberty, especially in certain

<P>self-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so

<P>sensible of every restraint, as they will go near to

<P>think their girdles and garters, to be bonds and

<P>shackles.&nbsp; Unmarried men are best friends, best

<P>masters, best servants; but not always best sub-

<P>jects; for they are light to run away; and almost

<P>all fugitives, are of that condition.&nbsp; A single life

<P>doth well with churchmen; for charity will hardly

<P>water the ground, where it must first fill a pool.&nbsp; It

<P>is indifferent for judges and magistrates; for if

<P>they be facile and corrupt, you shall have a ser-

<P>vant, five times worse than a wife.&nbsp; For soldiers, I

<P>find the generals commonly in their hortatives,

<P>put men in mind of their wives and children; and

<P>I think the despising of marriage amongst the

<P>Turks, maketh the vulgar soldier more base.&nbsp; Cer-

<P>tainly wife and children are a kind of discipline

<P>of humanity; and single men, though they may

<P>be many times more charitable, because their

<P>means are less exhaust, yet, on the other side, they

<P>are more cruel and hardhearted (good to make

<P>severe inquisitors), because their tenderness is not

<P>so oft called upon.&nbsp; Grave natures, led by custom,

<P>and therefore constant, are commonly loving hus-

<P>bands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam praetu-

<P>lit immortalitati.&nbsp; Chaste women are often proud

<P>and froward, as presuming upon the merit of their

<P>chastity.&nbsp; It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity

<P>and obedience, in the wife, if she think her hus-

<P>band wise; which she will never do, if she find him

<P>jealous.&nbsp; Wives are young men's mistresses; com-

<P>panions for middle age; and old men's nurses.&nbsp; So

<P>as a man may have a quarrel to marry, when he

<P>will.&nbsp; But yet he was reputed one of the wise men,

<P>that made answer to the question, when a man

<P>should marry, - A young man not yet, an elder

<P>man not at all.&nbsp; It is often seen that bad husbands,

<P>have very good wives; whether it be, that it raiseth

<P>the price of their husband's kindness, when it

<P>comes; or that the wives take a pride in their

<P>patience.&nbsp; But this never fails, if the bad husbands

<P>were of their own choosing, against their friends'

<P>consent; for then they will be sure to make good

<P>their own folly.
