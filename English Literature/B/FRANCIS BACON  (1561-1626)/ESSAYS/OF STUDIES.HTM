<P>STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and

<P>for ability.&nbsp; Their chief use for delight, is in

<P>privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in dis-

<P>course; and for ability, is in the judgment, and

<P>disposition of business.&nbsp; For expert men can exe-

<P>cute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one;

<P>but the general counsels, and the plots and mar-

<P>shalling of affairs, come best, from those that are

<P>learned.&nbsp; To spend too much time in studies is sloth;

<P>to use them too much for ornament, is affectation;

<P>to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the

<P>humor of a scholar.&nbsp; They perfect nature, and are

<P>perfected by experience: for natural abilities are

<P>like natural plants, that need proyning, by study;

<P>and studies themselves, do give forth directions too

<P>much at large, except they be bounded in by ex-

<P>perience.&nbsp; Crafty men contemn studies, simple men

<P>admire them, and wise men use them; for they

<P>teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom with-

<P>out them, and above them, won by observation.

<P>Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe

<P>and take for granted; nor to find talk and dis-

<P>course; but to weigh and consider.&nbsp; Some books are

<P>to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few

<P>to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are

<P>to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not

<P>curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and

<P>with diligence and attention.&nbsp; Some books also may

<P>be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by

<P>others; but that would be only in the less impor-

<P>tant arguments, and the meaner sort of books, else

<P>distilled books are like common distilled waters,

<P>flashy things.&nbsp; Reading maketh a full man; confer-

<P>ence a ready man; and writing an exact man.&nbsp; And

<P>therefore, if a man write little, he had need have

<P>a great memory; if he confer little, he had need

<P>have a present wit: and if he read little, he had

<P>need have much cunning, to seem to know, that

<P>he doth not.&nbsp; Histories make men wise; poets witty;

<P>the mathematics subtile; natural philosophy deep;

<P>moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend.

<P>Abeunt studia in mores.&nbsp; Nay, there is no stond or

<P>impediment in the wit, but may be wrought out

<P>by fit studies; like as diseases of the body, may

<P>have appropriate exercises.&nbsp; Bowling is good for

<P>the stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and

<P>breast; gentle walking for the stomach; riding for

<P>the head; and the like.&nbsp; So if a man's wit be wan-

<P>dering, let him study the mathematics; for in

<P>demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so

<P>little, he must begin again.&nbsp; If his wit be not apt to

<P>distinguish or find differences, let him study the

<P>Schoolmen; for they are cymini sectores.&nbsp; If he be

<P>not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one

<P>thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study 197

<P>the lawyers' cases.&nbsp; So every defect of the mind,

<P>may have a special receipt.
