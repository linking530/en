<P>EXCELLENT LORD:

<P>SALOMON saies; A good Name is as a precious

<P>oyntment; And I assure my selfe, such wil

<P>your Graces Name bee, with Posteritie.&nbsp; For your

<P>Fortune, and Merit both, have been Eminent.&nbsp; And

<P>you have planted Things, that are like to last.&nbsp; I doe

<P>now publish my Essayes; which, of all my other

<P>workes, have beene most Currant: For that, as it

<P>seemes, they come home, to Mens Businesse, and

<P>Bosomes.&nbsp; I have enlarged them, both in Number,

<P>and Weight; So that they are indeed a New Worke.

<P>I thought it therefore agreeable, to my Affection,

<P>and Obligation to your Grace, to prefix your Name

<P>before them, both in English, and in Latine.&nbsp; For I

<P>doe conceive, that the Latine Volume of them,

<P>(being in the Universall Language) may last, as

<P>long as Bookes last.&nbsp; My Instauration, I dedicated to

<P>the King: My Historie of Henry the Seventh,

<P>(which I have now also translated into Latine) and

<P>my Portions of Naturall History, to the Prince:

<P>And these I dedicate to your Grace; Being of the

<P>best Fruits, that by the good Encrease, which God

<P>gives to my Pen and Labours, I could yeeld.

<P>God leade your Grace by the Hand.&nbsp; Your Graces

<P>most Obliged and faithfull Servant,
