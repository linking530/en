<P>WE TAKE cunning for a sinister or crooked

<P>wisdom.&nbsp; And certainly there is a great dif-

<P>ference, between a cunning man, and a wise man;

<P>not only in point of honesty, but in point of ability.

<P>There be, that can pack the cards, and yet cannot

<P>play well; so there are some that are good in can-

<P>vasses and factions, that are otherwise weak men.

<P>Again, it is one thing to understand persons, and

<P>another thing to understand matters; for many

<P>are perfect in men's humors, that are not greatly

<P>capable of the real part of business; which is the

<P>constitution of one that hath studied men, more

<P>than books.&nbsp; Such men are fitter for practice, than

<P>for counsel; and they are good, but in their own

<P>alley: turn them to new men, and they have lost

<P>their aim; so as the old rule, to know a fool from a

<P>wise man, Mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos, et vide-

<P>bis, doth scarce hold for them.&nbsp; And because these

<P>cunning men, are like haberdashers of small

<P>wares, it is not amiss to set forth their shop.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is a point of cunning, to wait upon him with

<P>whom you speak, with your eye; as the Jesuits give

<P>it in precept: for there be many wise men, that

<P>have secret hearts, and transparent countenances.

<P>Yet this would be done with a demure abasing of

<P>your eye, sometimes, as the Jesuits also do use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another is, that when you have anything to

<P>obtain, of present despatch, you entertain and

<P>amuse the party, with whom you deal, with some

<P>other discourse; that he be not too much awake to

<P>make objections.&nbsp; I knew a counsellor and secre-

<P>tary, that never came to Queen Elizabeth of Eng-

<P>land, with bills to sign, but he would always first

<P>put her into some discourse of estate, that she

<P>mought the less mind the bills.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The like surprise may be made by moving

<P>things, when the party is in haste, and cannot stay

<P>to consider advisedly of that is moved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If a man would cross a business, that he doubts

<P>some other would handsomely and effectually

<P>move, let him pretend to wish it well, and move it

<P>himself in such sort as may foil it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The breaking off, in the midst of that one was

<P>about to say, as if he took himself up, breeds a

<P>greater appetite in him with whom you confer, to

<P>know more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And because it works better, when anything

<P>seemeth to be gotten from you by question, than

<P>if you offer it of yourself, you may lay a bait for a

<P>question, by showing another visage, and counte-

<P>nance, than you are wont; to the end to give occa-

<P>sion, for the party to ask, what the matter is of the

<P>change? As Nehemias did; And I had not before

<P>that time, been sad before the king.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In things that are tender and unpleasing, it is

<P>good to break the ice, by some whose words are of

<P>less weight, and to reserve the more weighty voice,

<P>to come in as by chance, so that he may be asked

<P>the question upon the other's speech: as Narcissus

<P>did, relating to Claudius the marriage of Messa-

<P>lina and Silius.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In things that a man would not be seen in him-

<P>self, it is a point of cunning, to borrow the name of

<P>the world; as to say, The world says, or There is a

<P>speech abroad.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I knew one that, when he wrote a letter, he

<P>would put that, which was most material, in the

<P>postscript, as if it had been a by-matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I knew another that, when he came to have

<P>speech, he would pass over that, that he intended

<P>most; and go forth, and come back again, and

<P>speak of it as of a thing, that he had almost forgot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some procure themselves, to be surprised, at

<P>such times as it is like the party that they work

<P>upon, will suddenly come upon them; and to be

<P>found with a letter in their hand, or doing some-

<P>what which they are not accustomed; to the end,

<P>they may be apposed of those things, which of

<P>themselves they are desirous to utter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is a point of cunning, to let fall those words in

<P>a man's own name, which he would have another

<P>man learn, and use, and thereupon take advan-

<P>tage.&nbsp; I knew two, that were competitors for the

<P>secretary's place in Queen Elizabeth's time, and

<P>yet kept good quarter between themselves; and

<P>would confer, one with another, upon the busi-

<P>ness; and the one of them said, That to be a secre-

<P>tary, in the declination of a monarchy, was a

<P>ticklish thing, and that he did not affect it: the

<P>other straight caught up those words, and dis-

<P>coursed with divers of his friends, that he had no

<P>reason to desire to be secretary, in the declination

<P>of a monarchy.&nbsp; The first man took hold of it, and

<P>found means it was told the Queen; who, hearing

<P>of a declination of a monarchy, took it so ill, as she

<P>would never after hear of the other's suit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There is a cunning, which we in England call,

<P>the turning of the cat in the pan; which is, when

<P>that which a man says to another, he lays it as if

<P>another had said it to him.&nbsp; And to say truth, it is

<P>not easy, when such a matter passed between two,

<P>to make it appear from which of them it first

<P>moved and began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is a way that some men have, to glance and

<P>dart at others, by justifying themselves by nega-

<P>tives; as to say, This I do not; as Tigellinus did

<P>towards Burrhus, Se non&nbsp; diversas&nbsp; spes,&nbsp; sed&nbsp; incolu-

<P>mitatem imperatoris simpliciter spectare.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some have in readiness so many tales and

<P>stories, as there is nothing they would insinuate,

<P>but they can wrap it into a tale; which serveth both

<P>to keep themselves more in guard, and to make

<P>others carry it with more pleasure.&nbsp; It is a good

<P>point of cunning, for a man to shape the answer

<P>he would have, in his own words and propositions;

<P>for it makes the other party stick the less.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is strange how long some men will lie in wait

<P>to speak somewhat they desire to say; and how far

<P>about they will fetch; and how many other mat-

<P>ters they will beat over, to come near it.&nbsp; It is a thing

<P>of great patience, but yet of much use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A sudden, bold, and unexpected question doth

<P>many times surprise a man, and lay him open.

<P>Like to him that , having changed his name, and

<P>walking in Paul's, another suddenly came behind

<P>him, and called him by his true name, whereat

<P>straightways he looked back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But these small wares, and petty points, of cun-

<P>ning, are infinite; and it were a good deed to make

<P>a list of them; for that nothing doth more hurt in

<P>a state, than that cunning men pass for wise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But certainly some there are that know the re-

<P>sorts and falls of business, that cannot sink into

<P>the main of it; like a house that hath convenient

<P>stairs and entries, but never a fair room.&nbsp; Therefore,

<P>you shall see them find out pretty looses in the con-

<P>clusion, but are no ways able to examine or debate

<P>matters.&nbsp; And yet commonly they take advantage

<P>of their inability, and would be thought wits of

<P>direction.&nbsp; Some build rather upon the abusing of

<P>others, and (as we now say) putting tricks upon

<P>them, than upon soundness of their own proceed-

<P>ings.&nbsp; But Solomon saith, Prudens advertit ad gres-

<P>sus suos; stultus divertit ad dolos.
