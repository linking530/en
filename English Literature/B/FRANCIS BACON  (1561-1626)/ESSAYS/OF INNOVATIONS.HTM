<P>AS THE births of living creatures, at first are ill-

<P>shapen, so are all innovations, which are the

<P>births of time.&nbsp; Yet notwithstanding, as those that

<P>first bring honor into their family, are commonly

<P>more worthy than most that succeed, so the first

<P>precedent (if it be good) is seldom attained by

<P>imitation.&nbsp; For ill, to man's nature, as it stands

<P>perverted, hath a natural motion, strongest in con-

<P>tinuance; but good, as a forced motion, strongest

<P>at first.&nbsp; Surely every medicine is an innovation;

<P>and he that will not apply new remedies, must

<P>expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator;

<P>and if time of course alter things to the worse, and

<P>wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the

<P>better, what shall be the end? It is true, that what

<P>is settled by custom, though it be not good, yet at

<P>least it is fit; and those things which have long

<P>gone together, are, as it were, confederate within

<P>themselves; whereas new things piece not so well;

<P>but though they help by their utility, yet they

<P>trouble by their inconformity.&nbsp; Besides, they are

<P>like strangers; more admired, and less favored.&nbsp; All

<P>this is true, if time stood still; which contrariwise

<P>moveth so round, that a froward retention of cus-

<P>tom, is as turbulent a thing as an innovation; and

<P>they that reverence too much old times, are but a

<P>scorn to the new.&nbsp; It were good, therefore, that men

<P>in their innovations would follow the example of

<P>time itself; which indeed innovateth greatly, but

<P>quietly, by degrees scarce to be perceived.&nbsp; For

<P>otherwise, whatsoever is new is unlooked for; and

<P>ever it mends some, and pairs others; and he that

<P>is holpen, takes it for a fortune, and thanks the

<P>time; and he that is hurt, for a wrong, and imput-

<P>eth it to the author.&nbsp; It is good also, not to try experi-

<P>ments in states, except the necessity be urgent, or

<P>the utility evident; and well to beware, that it be

<P>the reformation, that draweth on the change, and

<P>not the desire of change, that pretendeth the refor-

<P>mation.&nbsp; And lastly, that the novelty, though it be

<P>not rejected, yet be held for a suspect; and, as the

<P>Scripture saith, that we make a stand upon the

<P>ancient way, and then look about us, and discover

<P>what is the straight and right way, and so to walk

<P>in it.
