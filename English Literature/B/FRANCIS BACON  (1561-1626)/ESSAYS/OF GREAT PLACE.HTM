<P>MEN in great place are thrice servants: ser-

<P>vants of the sovereign or state; servants of

<P>fame; and servants of business.&nbsp; So as they have no

<P>freedom; neither in their persons, nor in their ac-

<P>tions, nor in their times.&nbsp; It is a strange desire, to

<P>seek power and to lose liberty: or to seek power

<P>over others, and to lose power over a man's self.

<P>The rising unto place is laborious; and by pains,

<P>men come to greater pains; and it is sometimes

<P>base; and by indignities, men come to dignities.

<P>The standing is slippery, and the regress is either

<P>a downfall, or at least an eclipse, which is a melan-

<P>choly thing.&nbsp; Cum non sis qui fueris, non esse cur

<P>velis vivere.&nbsp; Nay, retire men cannot when they

<P>would, neither will they, when it were reason; but

<P>are impatient of privateness, even in age and sick-

<P>ness, which require the shadow; like old towns-

<P>men, that will be still sitting at their street door,

<P>though thereby they offer age to scom.&nbsp; Certainly

<P>great persons had need to borrow other men's

<P>opinions, to think themselves happy; for if they

<P>judge by their own feeling, they cannot find it; but

<P>if they think with themselves, what other men

<P>think of them, and that other men would fain be,

<P>as they are, then they are happy, as it were, by

<P>report; when perhaps they find the contrary

<P>within.&nbsp; For they are the first, that find their own

<P>griefs, though they be the last, that find their

<P>own faults.&nbsp; Certainly men in great fortunes are

<P>strangers to themselves, and while they are in the

<P>puzzle of business, they have no time to tend their

<P>health, either of body or mind.&nbsp; Illi mors gravis

<P>incubat, qui notus nimis omnibus, ignotus moritur

<P>sibi.&nbsp; In place, there is license to do good, and evil;

<P>whereof the latter is a curse: for in evil, the best

<P>condition is not to win; the second, not to can.&nbsp; But

<P>power to do good, is the true and lawful end of

<P>aspiring.&nbsp; For good thoughts (though God accept

<P>them) yet, towards men, are little better than good

<P>dreams, except they be put in act; and that cannot

<P>be, without power and place, as the vantage, and

<P>commanding ground.&nbsp; Merit and good works, is

<P>the end of man's motion; and conscience of the

<P>same is the accomplishment of man's rest.&nbsp; For if a

<P>man can be partaker of God's theatre, he shall like-

<P>wise be partaker of God's rest.&nbsp; Et conversus Deus,

<P>ut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae, vidit

<P>quod omnia essent bona nimis; and then the sab-

<P>bath.&nbsp; In the discharge of thy place, set before thee

<P>the best examples; for imitation is a globe of pre-

<P>cepts.&nbsp; And after a time, set before thee thine own

<P>example; and examine thyself strictly, whether

<P>thou didst not best at first.&nbsp; Neglect not also the

<P>examples, of those that have carried themselves

<P>ill, in the same place; not to set off thyself, by tax-

<P>ing their memory, but to direct thyself, what to

<P>avoid.&nbsp; Reform therefore, without bravery, or scan-

<P>dal of former times and persons; but yet set it down

<P>to thyself, as well to create good precedents, as to

<P>follow them.&nbsp; Reduce things to the first institution,

<P>and observe wherein, and how, they have degen-

<P>erate; but yet ask counsel of both times; of the

<P>ancient time, what is best; and of the latter time,

<P>what is fittest.&nbsp; Seek to make thy course regular,

<P>that men may know beforehand, what they may

<P>expect; but be not too positive and peremptory;

<P>and express thyself well, when thou digressest

<P>from thy rule.&nbsp; Preserve the right of thy place; but

<P>stir not questions of jurisdiction; and rather as-

<P>sume thy right, in silence and de facto, than voice

<P>it with claims, and challenges.&nbsp; Preserve likewise

<P>the rights of inferior places; and think it more

<P>honor, to direct in chief, than to be busy in all.

<P>Embrace and invite helps, and advices, touching

<P>the execution of thy place; and do not drive away

<P>such, as bring thee information, as meddlers; but

<P>accept of them in good part.&nbsp; The vices of authority

<P>are chiefly four: delays, corruption, roughness,

<P>and facility.&nbsp; For delays: give easy access; keep

<P>times appointed; go through with that which is in

<P>hand, and interlace not business, but of necessity.

<P>For corruption: do not only bind thine own hands,

<P>or thy servants' hands, from taking, but bind the

<P>hands of suitors also, from offering.&nbsp; For integrity

<P>used doth the one; but integrity professed, and

<P>with a manifest detestation of bribery, doth the

<P>other.&nbsp; And avoid not only the fault, but the sus-

<P>picion.&nbsp; Whosoever is found variable, and changeth

<P>manifestly without manifest cause, giveth sus-

<P>picion of corruption.&nbsp; Therefore always, when thou

<P>changest thine opinion or course, profess it plainly,

<P>and declare it, together with the reasons that move

<P>thee to change; and do not think to steal it.&nbsp; A

<P>servant or a favorite, if he be inward, and no

<P>other apparent cause of esteem, is commonly

<P>thought, but a by-way to close corruption.&nbsp; For

<P>roughness: it is a needless cause of discontent:

<P>severity breedeth fear, but roughness breedeth

<P>hate.&nbsp; Even reproofs from authority, ought to be

<P>grave, and not taunting.&nbsp; As for facility: it is worse

<P>than bribery.&nbsp; For bribes come but now and then;

<P>but if importunity, or idle respects, lead a man, he

<P>shall never be without.&nbsp; As Solomon saith, To re-

<P>spect persons is not good; for such a man will

<P>transgress for a piece of bread.&nbsp; It is most true, that

<P>was anciently spoken, A place showeth the man.

<P>And it showeth some to the better, and some to the

<P>worse.&nbsp; Omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi im-

<P>perasset, saith Tacitus of Galba; but of Vespasian

<P>he saith, Solus imperantium, Vespasianus mutatus

<P>in melius; though the one was meant of sufficiency,

<P>the other of manners, and affection.&nbsp; It is an assured

<P>sign of a worthy and generous spirit, whom honor

<P>amends.&nbsp; For honor is, or should be, the place of

<P>virtue; and as in nature, things move violently to

<P>their place, and calmly in their place, so virtue in

<P>ambition is violent, in authority settled and calm.

<P>All rising to great place is by a winding star; and

<P>if there be factions, it is good to side a man's self,

<P>whilst he is in the rising, and to balance himself

<P>when he is placed.&nbsp; Use the memory of thy prede-

<P>cessor, fairly and tenderly; for if thou dost not, it is

<P>a debt will sure be paid when thou art gone.&nbsp; If

<P>thou have colleagues, respect them, and rather call

<P>them, when they look not for it, than exclude

<P>them , when they have reason to look to be called.

<P>Be not too sensible, or too remembering, of thy

<P>place in conversation, and private answers to

<P>suitors; but let it rather be said, When he sits in

<P>place, he is another man.
