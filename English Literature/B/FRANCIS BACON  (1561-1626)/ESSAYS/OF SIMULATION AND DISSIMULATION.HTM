<P>DISSIMULATION is but a faint kind of pol-

<P>icy, or wisdom; for it asketh a strong wit,

<P>and a strong heart, to know when to tell truth, and

<P>to do it.&nbsp; Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics,

<P>that are the great dissemblers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tacitus saith, Livia sorted well with the arts of

<P>her husband, and dissimulation of her son; attri-

<P>buting arts or policy to Augustus, and dissimula-

<P>tion to Tiberius.&nbsp; And again, when Mucianus

<P>encourageth Vespasian, to take arms against Vitel-

<P>lius, he saith, We rise not against the piercing

<P>judgment of Augustus, nor the extreme caution or

<P>closeness of Tiberius.&nbsp; These properties, of arts or

<P>policy, and dissimulation or closeness, are indeed

<P>habits and faculties several, and to be distin-

<P>guished.&nbsp; For if a man have that penetration of

<P>judgment, as he can discern what things are to

<P>be laid open, and what to be secreted, and what to

<P>be showed at half lights, and to whom and when

<P>(which indeed are arts of state, and arts of life, as

<P>Tacitus well calleth them), to him, a habit of dis-

<P>simulation is a hinderance and a poorness.&nbsp; But if

<P>a man cannot obtain to that judgment, then it is

<P>left to bim generally, to be close, and a dissembler.

<P>For where a man cannot choose, or vary in parti-

<P>culars, there it is good to take the safest, and wari-

<P>est way, in general; like the going softly, by one

<P>that cannot well see.&nbsp; Certainly the ablest men

<P>that ever were, have had all an openness, and

<P>frankness, of dealing; and a name of certainty and

<P>veracity; but then they were like horses well

<P>managed; for they could tell passing well, when to

<P>stop or turn; and at such times, when they thought

<P>the case indeed required dissimulation, if then

<P>they used it, it came to pass that the former opin-

<P>ion, spread abroad, of their good faith and clear-

<P>ness of dealing, made them almost invisible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There be three degrees of this hiding and veil-

<P>ing of a man's self.&nbsp; The first, closeness, reservation,

<P>and secrecy; when a man leaveth himself without

<P>observation, or without hold to be taken, what he

<P>is. The second, dissimulation, in the negative;

<P>when a man lets fall signs and arguments, that he

<P>is not, that he is.&nbsp; And the third, simulation, in the

<P>affirmative; when a man industriously and ex-

<P>pressly feigns and pretends to be, that he is not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the first of these, secrecy; it is indeed the

<P>virtue of a confessor.&nbsp; And assuredly, the secret

<P>man heareth many confessions.&nbsp; For who will open

<P>himself, to a blab or a babbler? But if a man be

<P>thought secret, it inviteth discovery; as the more

<P>close air sucketh in the more open; and as in con-

<P>fession, the revealing is not for worldly use, but for

<P>the ease of a man's heart, so secret men come to

<P>the knowledge of many things in that kind; while

<P>men rather discharge their minds, than impart

<P>their minds.&nbsp; In few words, mysteries are due to

<P>secrecy.&nbsp; Besides (to say truth) nakedness is un-

<P>comely, as well in mind as body; and it addeth no

<P>small reverence, to men's manners and actions, if

<P>they be not altogether open.&nbsp; As for talkers and

<P>futile persons, they are commonly vain and credu-

<P>lous withal.&nbsp; For he that talketh what he knoweth,

<P>will also talk what he knoweth not.&nbsp; Therefore set it

<P>down, that an habit of secrecy, is both politic and

<P>moral.&nbsp; And in this part, it is good that a man's face

<P>give his tongue leave to speak.&nbsp; For the discovery of

<P>a man' s self, by the tracts of his countenance, is a

<P>great weakness and betraying; by how much it is

<P>many times more marked, and believed, than a

<P>man's words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the second, which is dissimulation; it fol-

<P>loweth many times upon secrecy, by a necessity;

<P>so that he that will be secret, must be a dissembler

<P>in some degree.&nbsp; For men are too cunning, to suffer

<P>a man to keep an indifferent carriage between

<P>both, and to be secret, without swaying the bal-

<P>ance on either side.&nbsp; They will so beset a man with

<P>questions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him,

<P>that, without an absurd silence, he must show an

<P>inclination one way; or if he do not, they will

<P>gather as much by his silence, as by his speech.&nbsp; As

<P>for equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they can-

<P>not hold out long.&nbsp; So that no man can be secret,

<P>except he give himself a little scope of dissimula-

<P>tion; which is, as it were, but the skirts or train of

<P>secrecy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But for the third degree, which is simulation,

<P>and false profession; that I hold more culpable,

<P>and less politic; except it be in great and rare mat-

<P>ters.&nbsp; And therefore a general custom of simulation

<P>(which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of

<P>a natural falseness or fearfulness, or of a mind that

<P>hath some main faults, which because a man must

<P>needs disguise, it maketh him practise simulation

<P>in other things, lest his hand should be out of use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The great advantages of simulation and dissi-

<P>mulation are three.&nbsp; First, to lay asleep opposition,

<P>and to surprise.&nbsp; For where a man's intentions are

<P>published, it is an alarum, to call up all that are

<P>against them.&nbsp; The second is, to reserve to a man's

<P>self a fair retreat.&nbsp; For if a man engage himself by

<P>a manifest declaration, he must go through or take

<P>a fall.&nbsp; The third is, the better to discover the mind

<P>of another.&nbsp; For to him that opens himself, men

<P>will hardly show themselves adverse; but will fair

<P>let him go on, and turn their freedom of speech, to

<P>freedom of thought.&nbsp; And therefore it is a good

<P>shrewd proverb of the Spaniard, Tell a lie and find

<P>a troth.&nbsp; As if there were no way of discovery, but

<P>by simulation.&nbsp; There be also three disadvantages,

<P>to set it even.&nbsp; The first, that simulation and dissi-

<P>mulation commonly carry with them a show of

<P>fearfulness, which in any business, doth spoil the

<P>feathers, of round flying up to the mark.&nbsp; The sec-

<P>ond, that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits

<P>of many, that perhaps would otherwise co-operate

<P>with him; and makes a man walk almost alone, to

<P>his own ends.&nbsp; The third and greatest is, that it

<P>depriveth a man of one of the most principal in-

<P>struments for action; which is trust and belief.

<P>The best composition and temperature, is to have

<P>openness in fame and opinion; secrecy in habit;

<P>dissimulation in seasonable use; and a power to

<P>feign, if there be no remedy.
