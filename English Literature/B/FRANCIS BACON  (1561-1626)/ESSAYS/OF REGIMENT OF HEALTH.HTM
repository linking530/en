<P>THERE is a wisdom in this; beyond the rules of

<P>physic: a man's own observation, what he

<P>finds good of, and what he finds hurt of, is the best

<P>physic to preserve health.&nbsp; But it is a safer conclu-

<P>sion to say, This agreeth not well with me, there-

<P>fore, I will not continue it; than this, I find no

<P>offence of this, therefore I may use it.&nbsp; For strength

<P>of nature in youth, passeth over many excesses,

<P>which are owing a man till his age.&nbsp; Discern of the

<P>coming on of years, and think not to do the same

<P>things still; for age will not be defied.&nbsp; Beware of

<P>sudden change, in any great point of diet, and, if

<P>necessity enforce it, fit the rest to it.&nbsp; For it is a secret

<P>both in nature and state, that it is safer to change

<P>many things, than one.&nbsp; Examine thy customs of

<P>diet, sleep, exercise, apparel, and the like; and try,

<P>in any thing thou shalt judge hurtful, to discon-

<P>tinue it, by little and little; but so, as if thou dost

<P>find any inconvenience by the change, thou come

<P>back to it again: for it is hard to distinguish that

<P>which is generally held good and wholesome,

<P>from that which is good particularly, and fit for

<P>thine own body.&nbsp; To be free-minded and cheerfully

<P>disposed, at hours of meat, and of sleep, and of

<P>exercise, is one of the best precepts of long lasting.

<P>As for the passions, and studies of the mind; avoid

<P>envy, anxious fears; anger fretting inwards;

<P>subtle and knotty inquisitions; joys and exhilara-

<P>tions in excess; sadness not communicated.&nbsp; Enter-

<P>tain hopes; mirth rather than joy; variety of

<P>delights, rather than surfeit of them; wonder and

<P>admiration, and therefore novelties; studies that

<P>fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects,

<P>as histories, fables, and contemplations of nature.

<P>If you fly physic in health altogether, it will be too

<P>strange for your body, when you shall need it.&nbsp; If

<P>you make it too familiar, it will work no extra-

<P>ordinary effect, when sickness cometh.&nbsp; I commend

<P>rather some diet for certain seasons, than frequent

<P>use of physic, except it be grown into a custom.&nbsp; For

<P>those diets alter the body more, and trouble it less.

<P>Despise no new accident in your body, but ask

<P>opinion of it.&nbsp; In sickness, respect health prin-

<P>cipally; and in health, action.&nbsp; For those that put

<P>their bodies to endure in health, may in most sick-

<P>nesses, which are not very sharp, be cured only

<P>with diet, and tendering.&nbsp; Celsus could never have

<P>spoken it as a physician, had he not been a wise

<P>man withal, when he giveth it for one of the great

<P>precepts of health and lasting, that a man do vary,

<P>and interchange contraries, but with an inclina-

<P>tion to the more benign extreme: use fasting and

<P>full eating, but rather full eating; watching and

<P>sleep, but rather sleep; sitting and exercise, but

<P>rather exercise; and the like.&nbsp; So shall nature be

<P>cherished, and yet taught masteries.&nbsp; Physicians

<P>are, some of them, so pleasing and conformable to

<P>the humor of the patient, as they press not the true

<P>cure of the disease; and some other are so regular,

<P>in proceeding according to art for the disease, as

<P>they respect not sufficiently the condition of the

<P>patient.&nbsp; Take one of a middle temper; or if it may

<P>not be found in one man, combine two of either

<P>sort; and forget not to call as well, the best ac-

<P>quainted with your body, as the best reputed of

<P>for his faculty.
