<P>HOUSES are built to live in, and not to look on;

<P>therefore let use be preferred before uni-

<P>formity, except where both may be had.&nbsp; Leave

<P>the goodly fabrics of houses, for beauty only, to

<P>the enchanted palaces of the poets; who build them

<P>with small cost.&nbsp; He that builds a fair house, upon

<P>an ill seat, committeth himself to prison.&nbsp; Neither

<P>do I reckon it an ill seat, only where the air is un-

<P>wholesome; but likewise where the air is unequal;

<P>as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of

<P>ground, environed with higher hills round about

<P>it; whereby the heat of the sun is pent in, and the

<P>wind gathereth as in troughs; so as you shall have,

<P>and that suddenly, as great diversity of heat and

<P>cold as if you dwelt in several places.&nbsp; Neither is it

<P>ill air only that maketh an ill seat, but ill ways, ill

<P>markets; and, if you will consult with Momus, ill

<P>neighbors.&nbsp; I speak not of many more; want of

<P>water; want of wood, shade, and shelter; want of

<P>fruitfulness, and mixture of grounds of several

<P>natures; want of prospect; want of level grounds;

<P>want of places at some near distance for sports of

<P>hunting, hawking, and races; too near the sea, too

<P>remote; having the commodity of navigable rivers,

<P>or the discommodity of their overflowing; too far

<P>off from great cities, which may hinder business,

<P>or too near them, which lurcheth all provisions,

<P>and maketh everything dear; where a man hath

<P>a great living laid together, and where he is

<P>scanted: all which, as it is impossible perhaps to

<P>find together, so it is good to know them, and think

<P>of them, that a man may take as many as he can;

<P>and if he have several dwellings, that he sort them

<P>so&nbsp; that what he wanteth in the one, he may find in

<P>the other.&nbsp; Lucullus answered Pompey well; who,

<P>when he saw his stately galleries, and rooms so

<P>large and lightsome, in one of his houses, said,

<P>Surely an excellent place for summer, but how do

<P>you in winter? Lucullus answered, Why, do you

<P>not think me as wise as some fowl are, that ever

<P>change their abode towards the winter?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To pass from the seat, to the house itself; we will

<P>do as Cicero doth in the orator's art; who writes

<P>books De Oratore, and a book he entitles Orator;

<P>whereof the former, delivers the precepts of the

<P>art, and the latter, the perfection.&nbsp; We will there-

<P>fore describe a princely palace, making a brief

<P>model thereof.&nbsp; For it is strange to see, now in

<P>Europe, such huge buildings as the Vatican and

<P>Escurial and some others be, and yet scarce a very

<P>fair room in them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First, therefore, I say you cannot have a perfect

<P>palace except you have two several sides; a side for

<P>the banquet, as it is spoken of in the book of Hester,

<P>and a side for the household; the one for feasts and

<P>triumphs, and the other for dwelling.&nbsp; I understand

<P>both these sides to be not only returns, but parts

<P>of the front; and to be uniform without, though

<P>severally partitioned within; and to be on both

<P>sides of a great and stately tower, in the midst of

<P>the front, that, as it were, joineth them together

<P>on either hand.&nbsp; I would have on the side of the ban-

<P>quet, in front, one only goodly room above stairs,

<P>of some forty foot high; and under it a room for a

<P>dressing, or preparing place, at times of triumphs.

<P>On the other side, which is the household side, I

<P>wish it divided at the first, into a hall and a chapel

<P>(with a partition between); both of good state and

<P>bigness; and those not to go all the length, but to

<P>have at the further end, a winter and a summer

<P>parlor, both fair.&nbsp; And under these rooms, a fair

<P>and large cellar, sunk under ground; and likewise

<P>some privy kitchens, with butteries and pantries,

<P>and the like.&nbsp; As for the tower, I would have it two

<P>stories, of eighteen foot high apiece, above the two

<P>wings; and a goodly leads upon the top,railed with

<P>statuas interposed; and the same tower to be di-

<P>vided into rooms, as shall be thought fit.&nbsp; The stairs

<P>likewise to the upper rooms, let them be upon a

<P>fair open newel, and finely railed in, with images

<P>of wood, cast into a brass color; and a very fair

<P>landing-place at the top.&nbsp; But this to be, if you do

<P>not point any of the lower rooms, for a dining place

<P>of servants.&nbsp; For otherwise, you shall have the ser-

<P>vants' dinner after your own: for the steam of it,

<P>will come up as in a tunnel.&nbsp; And so much for the

<P>front.&nbsp; Only I understand the height of the first

<P>stairs to be sixteen foot, which is the height of the

<P>lower room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beyond this front, is there to be a fair court, but

<P>three sides of it, of a far lower building than the

<P>front.&nbsp; And in all the four corners of that court, fair

<P>staircases, cast into turrets, on the outside, and not

<P>within the row of buildings themselves.&nbsp; But those

<P>towers, are not to be of the height of the front, but

<P>rather proportionable to the lower building.&nbsp; Let

<P>the court not be paved, for that striketh up a great

<P>heat in summer, and much cold in winter.&nbsp; But

<P>only some side alleys, with a cross, and the quar-

<P>ters to graze, being kept shorn, but not too near

<P>shorn.&nbsp; The row of return on the banquet side, let it

<P>be all stately galleries: in which galleries let there

<P>be three, or five, fine cupolas in the length of it,

<P>placed at equal distance; and fine colored windows

<P>of several works.&nbsp; On the household side, chambers

<P>of presence and ordinary entertainments, with

<P>some bed-chambers; and let all three sides be a

<P>double house, without thorough lights on the sides,

<P>that you may have rooms from the sun, both for

<P>forenoon and afternoon.&nbsp; Cast it also, that you may

<P>have rooms, both for summer and winter; shady

<P>for summer, and warm for winter.&nbsp; You shall have

<P>sometimes fair houses so full of glass, that one can-

<P>not tell where to become, to be out of the sun or

<P>cold.&nbsp; For inbowed windows, I hold them of good

<P>use (in cities, indeed, upright do better, in respect

<P>of the uniformity towards the street); for they be

<P>pretty retiring places for conference; and besides,

<P>they keep both the wind and sun off; for that

<P>which would strike almost through the room, doth

<P>scarce pass the window.&nbsp; But let them be but few,

<P>four in the court, on the sides only.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beyond this court, let there be an inward court,

<P>of the same square and height; which is to be en-

<P>vironed with the garden on all sides; and in the

<P>inside, cloistered on all sides, upon decent and

<P>beautiful arches, as high as the first story.&nbsp; On the

<P>under story, towards the garden, let it be turned

<P>to a grotto, or a place of shade, or estivation.&nbsp; And

<P>only have opening and windows towards the gar-

<P>den; and be level upon the floor, no whit sunken

<P>under ground, to avoid all dampishness.&nbsp; And let

<P>there be a fountain, or some fair work of statuas, in

<P>the midst of this court; and to be paved as the other

<P>court was.&nbsp; These buildings to be for privy lodgings

<P>on both sides; and the end for privy galleries.

<P>Whereof you must foresee that one of them be for

<P>an infirmary, if the prince or any special person

<P>should be sick, with chambers, bed-chamber, ante-

<P>camera, and recamera joining to it.&nbsp; This upon the

<P>second story.&nbsp; Upon the ground story, a fair gallery,

<P>open, upon pillars; and upon the third story like-

<P>wise, an open gallery, upon pillars, to take the

<P>prospect and freshness of the garden.&nbsp; At both cor-

<P>ners of the further side, by way of return, let there

<P>be two delicate or rich cabinets, daintily paved,

<P>richly hanged, glazed with crystalline glass, and

<P>a rich cupola in the midst; and all other elegancy

<P>that may be thought upon.&nbsp; In the upper gallery

<P>too, I wish that there may be, if the place will yield

<P>it, some fountains running in divers places from

<P>the wall, with some fine avoidances.&nbsp; And thus

<P>much for the model of the palace; save that you

<P>must have, before you come to the front, three

<P>courts.&nbsp; A green court plain, with a wall about it;

<P>a second court of the same, but more garnished,

<P>with little turrets, or rather embellishments, upon

<P>the wall; and a third court, to make a square with

<P>the front, but not to be built, nor yet enclosed with

<P>a naked wall, but enclosed with terraces, leaded

<P>aloft, and fairly garnished, on the three sides; and

<P>cloistered on the inside, with pillars, and not with

<P>arches below.&nbsp; As for offices, let them stand at dis-

<P>tance, with some low galleries, to pass from them

<P>to the palace itself.
