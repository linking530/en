<P>IT IS a miserable state of mind, to have few

<P>things to desire, and many things to fear; and

<P>yet that commonly is the case of kings; who, being

<P>at the highest, want matter of desire, which makes

<P>their minds more languishing; and have many rep-

<P>resentations of perils and shadows, which makes

<P>their minds the less clear.&nbsp; And this is one reason

<P>also, of that effect which the Scripture speaketh of,

<P>That the king's heart is inscrutable.&nbsp; For multitude

<P>of jealousies, and lack of some predominant de-

<P>sire, that should marshal and put in order all the

<P>rest, maketh any man's heart, hard to find or

<P>sound.&nbsp; Hence it comes likewise, that princes many

<P>times make themselves desires, and set their hearts

<P>upon toys; sometimes upon a building; sometimes

<P>upon erecting of an order; sometimes upon the ad-

<P>vancing of a person; sometimes upon obtaining

<P>excellency in some art, or feat of the hand; as Nero

<P>for playing on the harp, Domitian for certainty

<P>of the hand with the arrow, Commodus for play-

<P>ing at fence, Caracalla for driving chariots, and

<P>the like.&nbsp; This seemeth incredible, unto those that

<P>know not the principle, that the mind of man, is

<P>more cheered and refreshed by profiting in small

<P>things, than by standing at a stay, in great.&nbsp; We see

<P>also that kings that have been fortunate conquer-

<P>ors, in their first years, it being not possible for

<P>them to go forward infinitely, but that they must

<P>have some check, or arrest in their fortunes, turn

<P>in their latter years to be superstitious, and melan-

<P>choly; as did Alexander the Great; Diocletian; and

<P>in our memory, Charles the Fifth; and others: for

<P>he that is used to go forward, and findeth a stop,

<P>falleth out of his own favor, and is not the thing

<P>he was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To speak now of the true temper of empire, it is

<P>a thing rare and hard to keep; for both temper, and

<P>distemper, consist of contraries.&nbsp; But it is one thing,

<P>to mingle contraries, another to interchange them.

<P>The answer of Apollonius to Vespasian, is full of

<P>excellent instruction.&nbsp; Vespasian asked him, What

<P>was Nero's overthrow? He answered, Nero could

<P>touch and tune the harp well; but in government,

<P>sometimes he used to wind the pins too high, some-

<P>times to let them down too low.&nbsp; And certain it is,

<P>that nothing destroyeth authority so much, as the

<P>unequal and untimely interchange of power

<P>pressed too far, and relaxed too much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This is true, that the wisdom of all these latter

<P>times, in princes' affairs, is rather fine deliveries,

<P>and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs, when they

<P>are near, than solid and grounded courses to keep

<P>them aloof.&nbsp; But this is but to try masteries with

<P>fortune.&nbsp; And let men beware, how they neglect

<P>and suffer matter of trouble to be prepared; for no

<P>man can forbid the spark, nor tell whence it may

<P>come.&nbsp; The difficulties in princes' business are many

<P>and great; but the greatest difficulty, is often in

<P>their own mind.&nbsp; For it is common with princes

<P>(saith Tacitus) to will contradictories, Sunt pler-

<P>umque regum voluntates vehementes, et inter se

<P>contrariae.&nbsp; For it is the solecism of power, to think

<P>to command the end, and yet not to endure the

<P>mean.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Kings have to deal with their neighbors, their

<P>wives, their children, their prelates or clergy, their

<P>nobles, their second-nobles or gentlemen, their

<P>merchants, their commons, and their men of war;

<P>and from all these arise dangers, if care and cir-

<P>cumspection be not used.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First for their neighbors; there can no general

<P>rule be given (for occasions are so variable), save

<P>one, which ever holdeth, which is, that princes do

<P>keep due sentinel, that none of their neighbors do

<P>ever grow so (by increase of territory, by embrac-

<P>ing of trade, by approaches, or the like), as they

<P>become more able to annoy them, than they were.

<P>And this is generally the work of standing coun-

<P>sels, to foresee and to hinder it.&nbsp; During that trium-

<P>virate of kings, King Henry the Eighth of England,

<P>Francis the First King of France, and Charles the

<P>Fifth Emperor, there was such a watch kept, that

<P>none of the three could win a palm of ground, but

<P>the other two would straightways balance it,

<P>either by confederation, or, if need were, by a war;

<P>and would not in any wise take up peace at inter-

<P>est.&nbsp; And the like was done by that league (which

<P>Guicciardini saith was the security of Italy) made

<P>between Ferdinando King of Naples, Lorenzius

<P>Medici, and Ludovicus Sforza, potentates, the one

<P>of Florence, the other of Milan.&nbsp; Neither is the opin-

<P>ion of some of the Schoolmen, to be received, that a

<P>war cannot justly be made, but upon a precedent

<P>injury or provocation.&nbsp; For there is no question, but

<P>a just fear of an imminent danger, though there be

<P>no blow given, is a lawful cause of a war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their wives; there are cruel examples of

<P>them.&nbsp; Livia is infamed, for the poisoning of her

<P>husband; Roxalana, Solyman's wife, was the

<P>destruction of that renowned prince, Sultan Mus-

<P>tapha, and otherwise troubled his house and suc-

<P>cession; Edward the Second of England, his queen,

<P>had the principal hand in the deposing and mur-

<P>der of her husband.&nbsp; This kind of danger, is then to

<P>be feared chiefly, when the wives have plots, for

<P>the raising of their own children; or else that they

<P>be advoutresses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their children; the tragedies likewise of

<P>dangers from them, have been many.&nbsp; And gen-

<P>erally, the entering of fathers into suspicion of

<P>their children, hath been ever unfortunate.&nbsp; The

<P>destruction of Mustapha (that we named before)

<P>was so fatal to Solyman's line, as the succession of

<P>the Turks, from Solyman until this day, is sus-

<P>pected to be untrue, and of strange blood; for that

<P>Selymus the Second, was thought to be supposi-

<P>tious.&nbsp; The destruction of Crispus, a young prince of

<P>rare towardness, by Constantinus the Great, his

<P>father, was in like manner fatal to his house; for

<P>both Constantinus and Constance, his sons, died

<P>violent deaths; and Constantius, his other son, did

<P>little better; who died indeed of sickness, but after

<P>that Julianus had taken arms against him.&nbsp; The de-

<P>struction of Demetrius, son to Philip the Second of

<P>Macedon, turned upon the father, who died of

<P>repentance.&nbsp; And many like examples there are;

<P>but few or none, where the fathers had good by

<P>such distrust; except it were, where the sons were

<P>up in open arms against them; as was Selymus the

<P>First against Bajazet; and the three sons of Henry

<P>the Second, King of England.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their prelates; when they are proud and

<P>great, there is also danger from them; as it was in

<P>the times of Anselmus, and Thomas Becket, Arch-

<P>bishops of Canterbury; who, with their croziers,

<P>did almost try it with the king's sword; and yet

<P>they had to deal with stout and haughty kings,

<P>William Rufus, Henry the First, and Henry the

<P>Second.&nbsp; The danger is not from that state, but

<P>where it hath a dependence of foreign authority;

<P>or where the churchmen come in and are elected,

<P>not by the collation of the king, or particular

<P>patrons, but by the people.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their nobles; to keep them at a distance, it is

<P>not amiss; but to depress them, may make a king

<P>more absolute, but less safe; and less able to per-

<P>form, any thing that he desires.&nbsp; I have noted it, in

<P>my History of King Henry the Seventh of Eng-

<P>land, who depressed bis nobility; whereupon it

<P>came to pass, that his times were full of difficulties

<P>and troubles; for the nobility, though they con-

<P>tinued loyal unto him, yet did they not co-operate

<P>with him in his business.&nbsp; So that in effect, he was

<P>fain to do all things himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their second-nobles; there is not much dan-

<P>ger from them, being a body dispersed.&nbsp; They may

<P>sometimes discourse high, but that doth little hurt;

<P>besides, they are a counterpoise to the higher no-

<P>bility, that they grow not too potent; and, lastly,

<P>being the most immediate in authority, with the

<P>common people, they do best temper popular com-

<P>motions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their merchants; they are vena porta; and

<P>if they flourish not, a kingdom may have good

<P>limbs, but will have empty veins, and nourish

<P>little.&nbsp; Taxes and imposts upon them, do seldom

<P>good to the king's revenue; for that that he wins in

<P>the hundred, he leeseth in the shire; the particular

<P>rates being increased, but the total bulk of trading,

<P>rather decreased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their commons; there is little danger from

<P>them, except it be, where they have great and po-

<P>tent heads; or where you meddle with the point of

<P>religion, or their customs, or means of life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For their men of war; it is a dangerous state,

<P>where they live and remain in a body, and are

<P>used to donatives; whereof we see examples in the

<P>janizaries, and pretorian bands of Rome; but train-

<P>ings of men, and arming them in several places,

<P>and under several commanders, and without

<P>donatives, are things of defence, and no danger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause

<P>good or evil times; and which have much venera-

<P>tion, but no rest.&nbsp; All precepts concerning kings,

<P>are in effect comprehended in those two remem-

<P>brances: memento quod es homo; and memento

<P>quod es Deus, or vice Dei; the one bridleth their

<P>power, and the other their will.
