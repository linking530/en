<P>IT HAD been hard for him that spake it to have

<P>put more truth and untruth together in few

<P>words, than in that speech, Whatsoever is delighted

<P>in solitude, is either a wild beast or a god.&nbsp; For it is

<P>most true, that a natural and secret hatred, and

<P>aversation towards society, in any man, hath

<P>somewhat of the savage beast; but it is most un-

<P>true, that it should have any character at all, of the

<P>divine nature; except it proceed, not out of a pleas-

<P>ure in solitude, but out of a love and desire to

<P>sequester a man's self, for a higher conversation:

<P>such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly

<P>in some of the heathen; as Epimenides the Can-

<P>dian, Numa the Roman, Empedocles the Sicilian,

<P>and Apollonius of Tyana; and truly and really, in

<P>divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of

<P>the church.&nbsp; But little do men perceive what soli-

<P>tude is, and how far it extendeth.&nbsp; For a crowd is

<P>not company; and faces are but a gallery of pic-

<P>tures; and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where

<P>there is no love.&nbsp; The Latin adage meeteth with it a

<P>little: Magna civitas, magna solitudo; because in

<P>a great town friends are scattered; so that there is

<P>not that fellowship, for the most part, which is in

<P>less neighborhoods.&nbsp; But we may go further, and

<P>affirm most truly, that it is a mere and miserable

<P>solitude to want true friends; without which the

<P>world is but a wilderness; and even in this sense

<P>also of solitude, whosoever in the frame of his

<P>nature and affections, is unfit for friendship, he

<P>taketh it of the beast, and not from humanity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A principal fruit of friendship, is the ease and

<P>discharge of the fulness and swellings of the heart,

<P>which passions of all kinds do cause and induce.

<P>We know diseases of stoppings, and suffocations,

<P>are the most dangerous in the body; and it is not

<P>much otherwise in the mind; you may take sarza

<P>to open the liver, steel to open the spleen, flowers

<P>of sulphur for the lungs, castoreum for the brain;

<P>but no receipt openeth the heart, but a true friend;

<P>to whom you may impart griefs, joys, fears, hopes,

<P>suspicions, counsels, and whatsoever lieth upon

<P>the heart to oppress it, in a kind of civil shrift or

<P>confession.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is a strange thing to observe, how high a rate

<P>great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of

<P>friendship, whereof we speak: so great, as they

<P>purchase it, many times, at the hazard of their

<P>own safety and greatness.&nbsp; For princes, in regard

<P>of the distance of their fortune from that of their

<P>subjects and servants, cannot gather this fruit, ex-

<P>cept (to make themselves capable thereof) they

<P>raise some persons to be, as it were, companions

<P>and almost equals to themselves, which many

<P>times sorteth to inconvenience.&nbsp; The modern lan-

<P>guages give unto such persons the name of favor-

<P>ites, or privadoes; as if it were matter of grace, or

<P>conversation.&nbsp; But the Roman name attaineth the

<P>true use and cause thereof, naming them parti-

<P>cipes curarum; for it is that which tieth the knot.

<P>And we see plainly that this hath been done, not

<P>by weak and passionate princes only, but by the

<P>wisest and most politic that ever reigned; who

<P>have oftentimes joined to themselves some of

<P>their servants; whom both themselves have called

<P>friends, and allowed other likewise to call them in

<P>the same manner; using the word which is re-

<P>ceived between private men.

<P>L. Sylla, when he commanded Rome, raised

<P>Pompey (after surnamed the Great) to that height,

<P>that Pompey vaunted himself for Sylla's over-

<P>match.&nbsp; For when he had carried the consulship for

<P>a friend of his, against the pursuit of Sylla, and

<P>that Sylla did a little resent thereat, and began to

<P>speak great, Pompey turned upon him again, and

<P>in effect bade him be quiet; for that more men

<P>adored the sun rising, than the sun setting.&nbsp; With

<P>Julius Caesar, Decimus Brutus had obtained that

<P>interest as he set him down in his testament, for

<P>heir in remainder, after his nephew.&nbsp; And this was

<P>the man that had power with him, to draw him

<P>forth to his death.&nbsp; For when Caesar would have

<P>discharged the senate, in regard of some ill pres-

<P>ages, and specially a dream of Calpurnia; this

<P>man lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair,

<P>telling him he hoped he would not dismiss the

<P>senate, till his wife had dreamt a better dream.

<P>And it seemeth his favor was so great, as Antonius,

<P>in a letter which is recited verbatim in one of

<P>Cicero's Philippics, calleth him venefica, witch;

<P>as if he had enchanted Caesar.&nbsp; Augustus raised

<P>Agrippa (though of mean birth) to that height, as

<P>when he consulted with Maecenas, about the mar-

<P>riage of his daughter Julia, Maecenas took the

<P>liberty to tell him, that he must either marry his

<P>daughter to Agrippa, or take away his life; there

<P>was no third way, he had made him so great.&nbsp; With

<P>Tiberius Caesar, Sejanus had ascended to that

<P>height, as they two were termed, and reckoned, as

<P>a pair of friends.&nbsp; Tiberius in a letter to him saith,

<P>Haec pro amicitia nostra non occultavi; and the

<P>whole senate dedicated an altar to Friendship, as

<P>to a goddess, in respect of the great dearness of

<P>friendship, between them two.&nbsp; The like, or more,

<P>was between Septimius Severus and Plautianus.

<P>For he forced his eldest son to marry the daughter

<P>of Plautianus; and would often maintain Plau-

<P>tianus, in doing affronts to his son; and did write

<P>also in a letter to the senate, by these words: I love

<P>the man so well, as I wish he may over-live me.

<P>Now if these princes had been as a Trajan, or a

<P>Marcus Aurelius, a man might have thought that

<P>this had proceeded of an abundant goodness of

<P>nature; but being men so wise, of such strength

<P>and severity of mind, and so extreme lovers of

<P>themselves, as all these were, it proveth most

<P>plainly that they found their own felicity (though

<P>as great as ever happened to mortal men) but as

<P>an half piece, except they mought have a friend,

<P>to make it entire; and yet, which is more, they

<P>were princes that had wives, sons, nephews; and

<P>yet all these could not supply the comfort of friend-

<P>ship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is not to be forgotten, what Comineus observ-

<P>eth of his first master, Duke Charles the Hardy,

<P>namely, that he would communicate his secrets

<P>with none; and least of all, those secrets which

<P>troubled him most.&nbsp; Whereupon he goeth on, and

<P>saith that towards his latter time, that closeness

<P>did impair, and a little perish his understanding.

<P>Surely Comineus mought have made the same

<P>judgment also, if it had pleased him, of his second

<P>master, Lewis the Eleventh, whose closeness was

<P>indeed his tormentor.&nbsp; The parable of Pythagoras

<P>is dark, but true; Cor ne edito; Eat not the heart.

<P>Certainly, if a man would give it a hard phrase,

<P>those that want friends, to open themselves unto,

<P>are carnnibals of their own hearts.&nbsp; But one thing

<P>is most admirable (wherewith I will conclude this

<P>first fruit of friendship), which is, that this com-

<P>municating of a man's self to his friend, works

<P>two contrary effects; for it redoubleth joys, and

<P>cutteth griefs in halves.&nbsp; For there is no man, that

<P>imparteth his joys to his friend, but he joyeth the

<P>more; and no man that imparteth his griefs to his

<P>friend, but he grieveth the less.&nbsp; So that it is in truth,

<P>of operation upon a man's mind, of like virtue as

<P>the alchemists use to attribute to their stone, for

<P>man's body; that it worketh all contrary effects,

<P>but still to the good and benefit of nature.&nbsp; But yet

<P>without praying in aid of alchemists, there is a

<P>manifest image of this, in the ordinary course of

<P>nature.&nbsp; For in bodies, union strengtheneth and

<P>cherisheth any natural action; and on the other

<P>side, weakeneth and dulleth any violent impres-

<P>sion: and even so it is of minds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The second fruit of friendship, is healthful and

<P>sovereign for the understanding, as the first is for

<P>the affections.&nbsp; For friendship maketh indeed a fair

<P>day in the affections, from storm and tempests; but

<P>it maketh daylight in the understanding, out of

<P>darkness, and confusion of thoughts.&nbsp; Neither is

<P>this to be understood only of faithful counsel,

<P>which a man receiveth from his friend; but before

<P>you come to that, certain it is, that whosoever hath

<P>his mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits

<P>and understanding do clarify and break up, in the

<P>communicating and discoursing with another; he

<P>tosseth his thoughts more easily; he marshalleth

<P>them more orderly, he seeth how they look when

<P>they are turned into words: finally, he waxeth

<P>wiser than himself; and that more by an hour's

<P>discourse, than by a day's meditation.&nbsp; It was well

<P>said by Themistocles, to the king of Persia, That

<P>speech was like cloth of Arras, opened and put

<P>abroad; whereby the imagery doth appear in

<P>figure; whereas in thoughts they lie but as in

<P>packs.&nbsp; Neither is this second fruit of friendship, in

<P>opening the understanding, restrained only to

<P>such friends as are able to give a man counsel;

<P>(they indeed are best;) but even without that, a

<P>man learneth of himself, and bringeth his own

<P>thoughts&nbsp; to light, and whetteth his wits as against

<P>a stone, which itself cuts not.&nbsp; In a word, a man

<P>were better relate himself to a statua, or picture,

<P>than to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Add now, to make this second fruit of friendship

<P>complete, that other point, which lieth more open,

<P>and falleth within vulgar observation; which is

<P>faithful counsel from a friend.&nbsp; Heraclitus saith

<P>well in one of his enigmas, Dry light is ever the

<P>best.&nbsp; And certain it is, that the light that a man

<P>receiveth by counsel from another, is drier and

<P>purer, than that which cometh from his own

<P>understanding and judgment; which is ever in-

<P>fused, and drenched, in his affections and customs.

<P>So as there is as much difference between the coun-

<P>sel, that a friend giveth, and that a man giveth

<P>himself, as there is between the counsel of a friend,

<P>and of a flatterer.&nbsp; For there is no such flatterer as

<P>is a man's self; and there is no such remedy against

<P>flattery of a man's self, as the liberty of a friend.

<P>Counsel is of two sorts: the one concerning man-

<P>ners, the other concerning business.&nbsp; For the first,

<P>the best preservative to keep the mind in health, is

<P>the faithful admonition of a friend.&nbsp; The calling of

<P>a man's self to a strict account, is a medicine, some-

<P>time too piercing and corrosive.&nbsp; Reading good

<P>books of morality, is a little flat and dead.&nbsp; Observ-

<P>ing our faults in others, is sometimes improper for

<P>our case.&nbsp; But the best receipt (best, I say, to work,

<P>and best to take) is the admonition of a friend.

<P>It is a strange thing to behold, what gross errors

<P>and extreme absurdities many (especially of the

<P>greater sort) do commit, for want of a friend to tell

<P>them of them; to the great damage both of their

<P>fame and fortune: for, as St. James saith, they are

<P>as men that look sometimes into a glass, and pres-

<P>ently forget their own shape and favor.&nbsp; As for

<P>business, a man may think, if he win, that two

<P>eyes see no more than one; or that a gamester seeth

<P>always more than a looker-on; or that a man in

<P>anger, is as wise as he that hath said over the four

<P>and twenty letters; or that a musket may be shot

<P>off as well upon the arm, as upon a rest; and such

<P>other fond and high imaginations, to think him-

<P>self all in all.&nbsp; But when all is done, the help of good

<P>counsel, is that which setteth business straight.

<P>And if any man think that he will take counsel,

<P>but it shall be by pieces; asking counsel in one

<P>business, of one man, and in another business, of

<P>another man; it is well (that is to say, better, per-

<P>haps, than if he asked none at all); but he runneth

<P>two dangers: one, that he shall not be faithfully

<P>counselled; for it is a rare thing, except it be from

<P>a perfect and entire friend, to have counsel given,

<P>but such as shall be bowed and crooked to some

<P>ends, which he hath, that giveth it.&nbsp; The other, that

<P>he shall have counsel given, hurtful and unsafe

<P>(though with good meaning), and mixed partly of

<P>mischief and partly of remedy; even as if you

<P>would call a physician, that is thought good for

<P>the cure of the disease you complain of, but is unac-

<P>quainted with your body; and therefore may put

<P>you in way for a present cure, but overthroweth

<P>your health in some other kind; and so cure the

<P>disease, and kill the patient.&nbsp; But a friend that is

<P>wholly acquainted with a man's estate, will be-

<P>ware, by furthering any present business, how he

<P>dasheth upon other inconvenience.&nbsp; And therefore

<P>rest not upon scattered counsels; they will rather

<P>distract and mislead, than settle and direct.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After these two noble fruits of friendship (peace

<P>in the affections, and support of the judgment),

<P>followeth the last fruit; which is like the pome-

<P>granate, full of many kernels; I mean aid, and

<P>bearing a part, in all actions and occasions.&nbsp; Here

<P>the best way to represent to life the manifold use

<P>of friendship, is to cast and see how many things

<P>there are, which a man cannot do himself; and

<P>then it will appear, that it was a sparing speech of

<P>the ancients, to say, that a friend is another him-

<P>self; for that a friend is far more than himself.

<P>Men have their time, and die many times, in de-

<P>sire of some things which they principally take to

<P>heart; the bestowing of a child, the finishing of a

<P>work, or the like.&nbsp; If a man have a true friend, he

<P>may rest almost secure that the care of those things

<P>will continue after him.&nbsp; So that a man hath, as it

<P>were, two lives in his desires.&nbsp; A man hath a body,

<P>and that body is confined to a place; but where

<P>friendship is, all offices of life are as it were granted

<P>to him, and his deputy.&nbsp; For he may exercise them

<P>by his friend.&nbsp; How many things are there which

<P>a man cannot, with any face or comeliness, say or

<P>do himself?&nbsp; A man can scarce allege his own

<P>merits with modesty, much less extol them; a man

<P>cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg; and

<P>a number of the like.&nbsp; But all these things are grace-

<P>ful, in a friend's mouth, which are blushing in a

<P>man's own.&nbsp; So again, a man's person hath many

<P>proper relations, which he cannot put off.&nbsp; A man

<P>cannot speak to his son but as a father; to his wife

<P>but as a husband; to his enemy but upon terms:

<P>whereas a friend may speak as the case requires,

<P>and not as it sorteth with the person.&nbsp; But to enu-

<P>merate these things were endless; I have given the

<P>rule, where a man cannot fitly play his own part;

<P>if he have not a friend, he may quit the stage.
