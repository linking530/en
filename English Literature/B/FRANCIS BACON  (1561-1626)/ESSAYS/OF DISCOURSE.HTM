<P>SOME, in their discourse,&nbsp; desire rather com-

<P>mendation of wit, in being able to hold all

<P>arguments, than of judgment, in discerning what

<P>is true; as if it were a praise, to know what might

<P>be said, and not, what should be thought.&nbsp; Some

<P>have certain common places, and themes, wherein

<P>they are good and want variety; which kind of

<P>poverty is for the most part tedious, and when it is

<P>once perceived, ridiculous.&nbsp; The honorablest part of

<P>talk,&nbsp; is to give the occasion; and again to moderate,

<P>and pass to somewhat else; for then a man leads the

<P>dance.&nbsp; It is good, in discourse and speech of con-

<P>versation,&nbsp; to vary and intermingle speech of the

<P>present occasion, with arguments, tales with rea-

<P>sons, asking of questions, with telling of opinions,

<P>and jest with earnest: for it is a dull thing to tire,

<P>and, as we say now, to jade, any thing too far.&nbsp; As

<P>for jest, there be certain things, which ought to be

<P>privileged from it; namely, religion, matters of

<P>state, great persons, any man's present business of

<P>importance, and any case that deserveth pity.&nbsp; Yet

<P>there be some, that think their wits have been

<P>asleep, except they dart out somewhat that is

<P>piquant, and to the quick.&nbsp; That is a vein which

<P>would be bridled:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Parce, puer, stimulis, et fortius utere loris.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And generally, men ought to find the difference,

<P>between saltness and bitterness.&nbsp; Certainly, he that

<P>hath a satirical vein, as he maketh others afraid of

<P>his wit, so he had need be afraid of others' memory.

<P>He that questioneth much, shall learn much, and

<P>content much; but especially, if he apply his ques-

<P>tions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh; for

<P>he shall give them occasion, to please themselves

<P>in speaking, and himself shall continually gather

<P>knowledge.&nbsp; But let his questions not be trouble-

<P>some; for that is fit for a poser.&nbsp; And let him be sure

<P>to leave other men, their turns to speak.&nbsp; Nay, if

<P>there be any, that would reign and take up all

<P>the time, let him find means to take them off,

<P>and to bring others on; as musicians use to do, with

<P>those that dance too long galliards.&nbsp; If you dis-

<P>semble, sometimes, your knowledge of that you

<P>are thought to know, you shall be thought, another

<P>time, to know that you know not.&nbsp; Speech of a

<P>man's self ought to be seldom, and well chosen.&nbsp; I

<P>knew one, was wont to say in scorn, He must needs

<P>be a wise man, he speaks so much of himself: and

<P>there is but one case, wherein a man may com-

<P>mend himself with good grace; and that is in

<P>commending virtue in another; especially if it be

<P>such a virtue, whereunto himself pretendeth.

<P>Speech of touch towards others, should be spar-

<P>ingly used; for discourse ought to be as a field,

<P>without coming home to any man.&nbsp; I knew two

<P>noblemen, of the west part of England, whereof

<P>the one was given to scoff, but kept ever royal cheer

<P>in his house; the other would ask, of those that had

<P>been at the other's table, Tell truly, was there never

<P>a flout or dry blow given? To which the guest

<P>would answer, Such and such a thing passed.

<P>The lord would say, I thought, he would mar a

<P>good dinner.&nbsp; Discretion of speech, is more than

<P>eloquence; and to speak agreeably to him, with

<P>whom we deal, is more than to speak in good

<P>words, or in good order.&nbsp; A good continued speech,

<P>without a good speech of interlocution, shows

<P>slowness: and a good reply or second speech, with-

<P>out a good settled speech, showeth shallowness

<P>and weakness.&nbsp; As we see in beasts, that those that

<P>are weakest in the course, are yet nimblest in the

<P>turn; as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare.

<P>To use too many circumstances, ere one come to

<P>the matter, is wearisome; to use none at all, is

<P>blunt.
