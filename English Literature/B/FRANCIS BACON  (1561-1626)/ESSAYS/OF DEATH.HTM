<P>MEN fear death, as children fear to go in the

<P>dark; and as that natural fear in children,

<P>is increased with tales, so is the other.&nbsp; Certainly,

<P>the contemplation of death, as the wages of sin,

<P>and passage to another world, is holy and relig-

<P>ious; but the fear of it, as a tribute due unto nature,

<P>is weak.&nbsp; Yet in religious meditations, there is some-

<P>times mixture of vanity, and of superstition.&nbsp; You

<P>shall read, in some of the friars' books of mortifica-

<P>tion, that a man should think with himself, what

<P>the pain is, if he have but his finger's end pressed,

<P>or tortured, and thereby imagine, what the pains

<P>of death are, when the whole body is corrupted,

<P>and dissolved; when many times death passeth,

<P>with less pain than the torture of a limb; for the

<P>most vital parts, are not the quickest of sense.&nbsp; And

<P>by him that spake only as a philosopher, and nat-

<P>ural man, it was well said, Pompa mortis magis

<P>terret, quam mors ipsa.&nbsp; Groans, and convulsions,

<P>and a discolored face, and friends weeping, and

<P>blacks, and obsequies, and the like, show death

<P>terrible.&nbsp; It is worthy the observing, that there is no

<P>passion in the mind of man, so weak, but it mates,

<P>and masters, the fear of death; and therefore,

<P>death is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath

<P>so many attendants about him, that can win the

<P>combat of him.&nbsp; Revenge triumphs over death; love

<P>slights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear

<P>preoccupateth it; nay, we read, after Otho the em-

<P>peror had slain himself, pity (which is the tender-

<P>est of affections) provoked many to die, out of mere

<P>compassion to their sovereign, and as the truest

<P>sort of followers.&nbsp; Nay, Seneca adds niceness and

<P>satiety: Cogita quamdiu eadem feceris; mori velle,

<P>non tantum fortis aut miser, sed etiam fastidiosus

<P>potest.&nbsp; A man would die, though he were neither

<P>valiant, nor miserable, only upon a weariness to

<P>do the same thing so oft, over and over.&nbsp; It is no less

<P>worthy, to observe, how little alteration in good

<P>spirits, the approaches of death make; for they

<P>appear to be the same men, till the last instant.

<P>Augustus Caesar died in a compliment; Livia, con-

<P>jugii nostri memor, vive et vale.&nbsp; Tiberius in dissi-

<P>mulation; as Tacitus saith of him, Jam Tiberium

<P>vires et corpus, non dissimulatio, deserebant.&nbsp; Ves-

<P>pasian in a jest, sitting upon the stool; Ut puto deus

<P>fio.&nbsp; Galba with a sentence; Feri, si ex re sit populi

<P>Romani; holding forth his neck.&nbsp; Septimius Severus

<P>in despatch; Adeste si quid mihi restat agendum.

<P>And the like.&nbsp; Certainly the Stoics bestowed too

<P>much cost upon death, and by their great prepara-

<P>tions, made it appear more fearful.&nbsp; Better saith he,

<P>qui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat

<P>naturae.&nbsp; It is as natural to die, as to be born; and to

<P>a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful, as the

<P>other.&nbsp; He that dies in an earnest pursuit, is like one

<P>that is wounded in hot blood; who, for the time,

<P>scarce feels the hurt; and therefore a mind fixed,

<P>and bent upon somewhat that is good, doth avert

<P>the dolors of death.&nbsp; But, above all, believe it, the

<P>sweetest canticle is', Nunc dimittis; when a man

<P>hath obtained worthy ends, and expectations.

<P>Death hath this also; that it openeth the gate to

<P>good fame, and extinguisheth envy. - Extinctus

<P>amabitur idem.
