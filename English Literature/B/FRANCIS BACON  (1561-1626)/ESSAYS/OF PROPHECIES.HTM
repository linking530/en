<P>I MEAN not to speak of divine prophecies; nor

<P>of heathen oracles; nor of natural predictions;

<P>but only of prophecies that have been of cer-

<P>tain memory, and from hidden causes.&nbsp; Saith the

<P>Pythonissa to Saul, To-morrow thou and thy son

<P>shall be with me.&nbsp; Homer hath these verses:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At domus AEneae cunctis dominabitur oris,

<P>Et nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A prophecy, as it seems, of the Roman empire.

<P>Seneca the tragedian hath these verses:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp; --Venient annis

<P>Saecula seris, quibus Oceanus

<P>Vincula rerum laxet, et ingens

<P>Pateat Tellus, Tiphysque novos

<P>Detegat orbes; nec sit terris

<P>Ultima Thule:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>a prophecy of the discovery of America.&nbsp; The daugh-

<P>ter of Polycrates, dreamed that Jupiter bathed her

<P>father, and Apollo anointed him; and it came to

<P>pass, that he was crucified in an open place, where

<P>the sun made his body run with sweat, and the

<P>rain washed it.&nbsp; Philip of Macedon dreamed, he

<P>sealed up bis wife's belly; whereby he did expound

<P>it, that his wife should be barren; but Aristander

<P>the soothsayer, told him his wife was with child,

<P>because men do not use to seal vessels, that are

<P>empty.&nbsp; A phantasm that appeared to M. Brutus, in

<P>his tent, said to him, Philippis iterum me videbis.

<P>Tiberius said to Galba, Tu quoque, Galba, degusta-

<P>bis imperium.&nbsp; In Vespasian's time, there went a

<P>prophecy in the East, that those that should come

<P>forth of Judea, should reign over the world:

<P>which though it may be was meant of our Savior;

<P>yet Tacitus expounds it of Vespasian.&nbsp; Domitian

<P>dreamed, the night before he was slain, that a

<P>golden head was growing, out of the nape of his

<P>neck: and indeed, the succession that followed him

<P>for many years, made golden times.&nbsp; Henry the

<P>Sixth of England, said of Henry the Seventh, when

<P>he was a lad, and gave him water, This is the lad

<P>that shall enjoy the crown, for which we strive.

<P>When I was in France, I heard from one Dr. Pena,

<P>that the Queen Mother, who was given to curious

<P>arts, caused the King her husband's nativity to be

<P>calculated, under a false name; and the astrologer

<P>gave a judgment, that he should be killed in a duel;

<P>at which the Queen laughed, thinking her hus-

<P>band to be above challenges and duels: but he was

<P>slain upon a course at tilt, the splinters of the staff

<P>of Montgomery going in at his beaver.&nbsp; The trivial

<P>prophecy, which I heard when I was a child, and

<P>Queen Elizabeth was in the flower of her years,

<P>was,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When hempe is spun
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>England's done:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>whereby it was generally conceived, that after the

<P>princes had reigned, which had the principal

<P>letters of that word hempe (which were Henry,

<P>Edward, Mary, Philip, and Elizabeth), England

<P>should come to utter confusion; which, thanks be

<P>to God, is verified only in the change of the name;

<P>for that the King's style, is now no more of Eng-

<P>land but of Britain.&nbsp; There was also another proph-

<P>ecy, before the year of '88, which I do not well

<P>understand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There shall be seen upon a day,

<P>Between the Baugh and the May,

<P>The black fleet of Norway.

<P>When that that is come and gone,

<P>England build houses of lime and stone,

<P>For after wars shall you have none.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was generally conceived to be meant, of the

<P>Spanish fleet that came in '88: for that the king of

<P>Spain's surname, as they say, is Norway.&nbsp; The pre-

<P>diction of Regiomontanus,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>was thought likewise accomplished in the sending

<P>of that great fleet, being the greatest in strength,

<P>though not in number, of all that ever swam upon

<P>the sea.&nbsp; As for Cleon's dream, I think it was a jest.

<P>It was, that he was devoured of a long dragon; and

<P>it was expounded of a maker of sausages, that

<P>troubled him exceedingly.&nbsp; There are numbers of

<P>the like kind; especially if you include dreams, and

<P>predictions of astrology.&nbsp; But I have set down these

<P>few only, of certain credit, for example.&nbsp; My judg-

<P>ment is, that they ought all to be despised; and

<P>ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside.

<P>Though when I say despised, I mean it as for be-

<P>lief; for otherwise, the spreading, or publishing,

<P>of them, is in no sort to be despised.&nbsp; For they have

<P>done much mischief; and I see many severe laws

<P>made, to suppress them.&nbsp; That that hath given them

<P>grace, and some credit, consisteth in three things.

<P>First, that men mark when they hit, and never

<P>mark when they miss; as they do generally also of

<P>dreams.&nbsp; The second is, that probable conjectures,

<P>or obscure traditions, many times turn themselves

<P>into prophecies; while the nature of man, which

<P>coveteth divination, thinks it no peril to foretell

<P>that which indeed they do but collect.&nbsp; As that of

<P>Seneca's verse.&nbsp; For so much was then subject to

<P>demonstration, that the globe of the earth had

<P>great parts beyond the Atlantic, which mought

<P>be probably conceived not to be all sea: and adding

<P>thereto the tradition in Plato's Timaeus, and his

<P>Atlanticus, it mought encourage one to turn it to

<P>a prediction.&nbsp; The third and last (which is the great

<P>one) is, that almost all of them, being infinite in

<P>number, have been impostures, and by idle and

<P>crafty brains merely contrived and feigned, after

<P>the event past.
