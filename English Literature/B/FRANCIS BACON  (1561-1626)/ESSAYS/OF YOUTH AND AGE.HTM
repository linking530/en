<P>A MAN that is young in years, may be old in

<P>hours, if he have lost no time.&nbsp; But that hap-

<P>peneth rarely.&nbsp; Generally, youth is like the first

<P>cogitations, not so wise as the second.&nbsp; For there is

<P>a youth in thoughts, as well as in ages.&nbsp; And yet the

<P>invention of young men, is more lively than that

<P>of old; and imaginations stream into their minds

<P>better, and, as it were, more divinely.&nbsp; Natures that

<P>have much heat, and great and violent desires and

<P>perturbations, are not ripe for action, till they have

<P>passed the meridian of their years; as it was with

<P>Julius Caesar and Septimius Severus.&nbsp; Of the latter,

<P>of whom it is said, Juventutem egit erroribus, imo

<P>furoribus, plenam.&nbsp; And yet he was the ablest em-

<P>peror, almost, of all the list.&nbsp; But reposed natures

<P>may do well in youth.&nbsp; As it is seen in Augustus

<P>Caesar, Cosmus Duke of Florence, Gaston de Foix,

<P>and others.&nbsp; On the other side, heat and vivacity in

<P>age, is an excellent composition for business.

<P>Young men are fitter to invent, than to judge; fitter

<P>for execution, than for counsel; and fitter for new

<P>projects, than for settled business.&nbsp; For the experi-

<P>ence of age, in things that fall within the compass

<P>of it, directeth them; but in new things, abuseth

<P>them.

<P>The errors of young men, are the ruin of busi-

<P>ness; but the errors of aged men, amount but to

<P>this, that more might have been done, or sooner.

<P>Young men, in the conduct and manage of actions,

<P>embrace more than they can hold; stir more than

<P>they can quiet; fly to the end, without considera-

<P>tion of the means and degrees; pursue some

<P>few principles, which they have chanced upon

<P>absurdly; care not to innovate, which draws un-

<P>known inconveniences; use extreme remedies at

<P>first; and, that which doubleth all errors, will not

<P>acknowledge or retract them; like an unready

<P>horse, that will neither stop nor turn.&nbsp; Men of age

<P>object too much, consult too long, adventure too

<P>little, repent too soon, and seldom drive business

<P>home to the full period, but content themselves

<P>with a mediocrity of success.&nbsp; Certainly it is good to

<P>compound employments of both; for that will be

<P>good for the present, because the virtues of either

<P>age, may correct the defects of both; and good for

<P>succession, that young men may be learners, while

<P>men in age are actors; and, lastly, good for extern

<P>accidents, because authority followeth old men,

<P>and favor and popularity, youth.&nbsp; But for the moral

<P>part, perhaps youth will have the pre-eminence, as

<P>age hath for the politic.&nbsp; A certain rabbin, upon the

<P>text, Your young men shall see visions, and your

<P>old men shall dream dreams, inferreth that young

<P>men, are admitted nearer to God than old, because

<P>vision, is a clearer revelation, than a dream.&nbsp; And

<P>certainly, the more a man drinketh of the world,

<P>the more it intoxicateth; and age doth profit rather

<P>in the powers of understanding, than in the virtues

<P>of the will and affections.&nbsp; There be some, have an

<P>over-early ripeness in their years, which fadeth

<P>betimes.&nbsp; These are, first, such as have brittle wits,

<P>the edge whereof is soon turned; such as was Her-

<P>mogenes the rhetorician, whose books are exceed-

<P>ing subtle; who afterwards waxed stupid.&nbsp; A second

<P>sort, is of those that have some natural dispositions

<P>which have better grace in&nbsp; youth, than in age;

<P>such as is a fluent and luxuriant speech; which

<P>becomes youth well, but not age: so Tully saith of

<P>Hortensius, Idem manebat, neque idem decebat.

<P>The third is of such, as take too high a strain at the

<P>first, and are magnanimous, more than tract of

<P>years can uphold.&nbsp; As was Scipio Africanus, of

<P>whom Livy saith in effect, Ultima primis cedebant.
