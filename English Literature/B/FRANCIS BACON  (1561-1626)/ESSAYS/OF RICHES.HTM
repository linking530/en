<P>I CANNOT call riches better than the baggage

<P>of virtue.&nbsp; The Roman word is better, impedi-

<P>menta.&nbsp; For as the baggage is to an army, so is riches

<P>to virtue.&nbsp; It cannot be spared, nor left behind, but

<P>it hindereth the march; yea, and the care of it,

<P>sometimes loseth or disturbeth the victory.&nbsp; Of

<P>great riches there is no real use, except it be in the

<P>distribution; the rest is but conceit.&nbsp; So saith Solo-

<P>mon, Where much is, there are many to consume

<P>it; and what hath the owner, but the sight of it

<P>with his eyes? The personal fruition in any man,

<P>cannot reach to feel great riches: there is a custody

<P>of them; or a power of dole, and donative of them;

<P>or a fame of them; but no solid use to the owner.

<P>Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon

<P>little stones and rarities? and what works of osten-

<P>tation are undertaken, because there might seem

<P>to be some use of great riches? But then you will

<P>say, they may be of use, to buy men out of dangers

<P>or troubles.&nbsp; As Solomon saith, Riches are as a

<P>strong hold, in the imagination of the rich man.

<P>But this is excellently expressed, that it is in imagi-

<P>nation, and not always in fact.&nbsp; For certainly great

<P>riches, have sold more men, than they have bought

<P>out.&nbsp; Seek not proud riches, but such as thou mayest

<P>get justly, use soberly, distribute cheerfully, and

<P>leave contentedly.&nbsp; Yet have no abstract nor friarly

<P>contempt of them.&nbsp; But distinguish, as Cicero saith

<P>well of Rabirius Posthumus, In studio rei ampli-

<P>ficandae apparebat, non avaritiae praedam, sed

<P>instrumentum bonitati quaeri.&nbsp; Harken also to

<P>Solomon, and beware of hasty gathering of riches;

<P>Qui festinat ad divitias, non erit insons.&nbsp; The poets

<P>feign, that when Plutus (which is Riches) is sent

<P>from Jupiter, he limps and goes slowly; but when

<P>he is sent from Pluto, he runs, and is swift of foot.

<P>Meaning that riches gotten by good means, and

<P>just labor, pace slowly; but when they come by

<P>the death of others (as by the course of inheritance,

<P>testaments, and the like), they come tumbling

<P>upon a man.&nbsp; But it mought be applied likewise to

<P>Pluto, taking him for the devil.&nbsp; For when riches

<P>come from the devil (as by fraud and oppression,

<P>and unjust means), they come upon speed.&nbsp; The

<P>ways to enrich are many, and most of them foul.

<P>Parsimony is one of the best, and yet is not inno-

<P>cent; for it withholdeth men from works of liberal-

<P>ity and charity.&nbsp; The improvement of the ground,

<P>is the most natural obtaining of riches; for it is our

<P>great mother's blessing, the earth's; but it is slow.

<P>And yet where men of great wealth do stoop to

<P>husbandry, it multiplieth riches exceedingly.&nbsp; I

<P>knew a nobleman in England, that had the great-

<P>est audits of any man in my time; a great grazier,

<P>a great sheep-master, a great timber man, a great

<P>collier, a great corn-master, a great lead-man, and

<P>so of iron, and a number of the like points of hus-

<P>bandry.&nbsp; So as the earth seemed a sea to him, in

<P>respect of the perpetual importation.&nbsp; It was truly

<P>observed by one, that himself came very hardly,

<P>to a little riches, and very easily, to great riches.

<P>For when a man's stock is come to that, that he can

<P>expect the prime of markets, and overcome those

<P>bargains, which for their greatness are few men's

<P>money, and be partner in the industries of younger

<P>men, he cannot but increase mainly.&nbsp; The gains of

<P>ordinary trades and vocations are honest; and

<P>furthered by two things chiefly: by diligence, and

<P>by a good name, for good and fair dealing.&nbsp; But the

<P>gains of bargains, are of a more doubtful nature;

<P>when men shall wait upon others' necessity, broke

<P>by servants and instruments to draw them on, put

<P>off others cunningly, that would be better chap-

<P>men, and the like practices, which are crafty and

<P>naught.&nbsp; As for the chopping of bargains, when a

<P>man buys not to hold but to sell over again, that

<P>commonly grindeth double, both upon the seller,

<P>and upon the buyer.&nbsp; Sharings do greatly enrich,

<P>if the hands be well chosen, that are trusted.&nbsp; Usury

<P>is the certainest means of gain, though one of the

<P>worst; as that whereby a man doth eat his bread,

<P>in sudore vultus alieni; and besides, doth plough

<P>upon Sundays.&nbsp; But yet certain though it be, it hath

<P>flaws; for that the scriveners and brokers do value

<P>unsound men, to serve their own turn.&nbsp; The fortune

<P>in being the first, in an invention or in a privilege,

<P>doth cause sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in

<P>riches; as it was with the first sugar man, in the

<P>Canaries.&nbsp; Therefore if a man can play the true

<P>logician, to have as well judgment, as invention,

<P>he may do great matters; especially if the times be

<P>fit.&nbsp; He that resteth upon gains certain, shall hardly

<P>grow to great riches; and he that puts all upon

<P>adventures, doth oftentimes break and come to

<P>poverty: it is good, therefore, to guard adventures

<P>with certainties, that may uphold losses.&nbsp; Monopo-

<P>lies, and coemption of wares for re-sale, where

<P>they are not restrained, are great means to enrich;

<P>especially if the party have intelligence, what

<P>things are like to come into request, and so store

<P>himself beforehand.&nbsp; Riches gotten by service,

<P>though it be of the best rise, yet when they are

<P>gotten by flattery, feeding humors, and other serv-

<P>ile conditions, they may be placed amongst the

<P>worst.&nbsp; As for fishing for testaments and executor-

<P>ships (as Tacitus saith of Seneca, testamenta et

<P>orbos tamquam indagine capi), it is yet worse; by

<P>how much men submit themselves to meaner per-

<P>sons, than in service.&nbsp; Believe not much, them that

<P>seem to despise riches; for they despise them, that

<P>despair of them; and none worse, when they come

<P>to them.&nbsp; Be not penny-wise; riches have wings,

<P>and sometimes they fly away of themselves, some-

<P>times they must be set flying, to bring in more.

<P>Men leave their riches, either to their kindred, or

<P>to the public; and moderate portions, prosper best

<P>in both.&nbsp; A great state left to an heir, is as a lure to

<P>all the birds of prey round about, to seize on him, if

<P>he be not the better stablished in years and judg-

<P>ment.&nbsp; Likewise glorious gifts and foundations, are

<P>like sacrifices without salt; and but the painted

<P>sepulchres of alms, which soon will putrefy, and

<P>corrupt inwardly.&nbsp; Therefore measure not thine

<P>advancements, by quantity, but frame them by

<P>measure: and defer not charities till death; for,

<P>certainly, if a man weigh it rightly, he that doth

<P>so, is rather liberal of another man's, than of his

<P>own.
