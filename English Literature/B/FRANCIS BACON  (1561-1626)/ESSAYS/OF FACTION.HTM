<P>MANY have an opinion not wise, that for a

<P>prince to govern his estate, or for a great

<P>person to govern his proceedings, according to the

<P>respect of factions, is a principal part of policy;

<P>whereas contrariwise, the chiefest wisdom, is

<P>either in ordering those things which are general,

<P>and wherein men of several factions do neverthe-

<P>less agree; or in dealing with correspondence to

<P>particular persons, one by one.&nbsp; But I say not that

<P>the considerations of factions, is to be neglected.

<P>Mean men, in their rising, must adhere; but

<P>great men, that have strength in themselves, were

<P>better to maintain themselves indifferent, and

<P>neutral.&nbsp; Yet even in beginners, to adhere so moder-

<P>ately, as he be a man of the one faction, which is

<P>most passable with the other, commonly giveth

<P>best way.&nbsp; The lower and weaker faction, is the

<P>firmer in conjunction; and it is often seen, that a

<P>few that are stiff, do tire out a greater number, that

<P>are more moderate.&nbsp; When one of the factions is ex-

<P>tinguished, the remaining subdivideth; as the

<P>faction between Lucullus, and the rest of the

<P>nobles of the senate (which they called Optimates)

<P>held out awhile, against the faction of Pompey

<P>and Caesar; but when the senate's authority was

<P>pulled down, Caesar and Pompey soon after brake.

<P>The faction or party of Antonius and Octavianus

<P>Caesar, against Brutus and Cassius, held out like-

<P>wise for a time; but when Brutus and Cassius were

<P>overthrown, then soon after, Antonius and Octa-

<P>vianus brake and subdivided.&nbsp; These examples are

<P>of wars, but the same holdeth in private factions.

<P>And therefore, those that are seconds in factions,

<P>do many times, when the faction subdivideth,

<P>prove principals; but many times also, they prove

<P>ciphers and cashiered; for many a man's strength

<P>is in opposition; and when that faileth, he groweth

<P>out of use.&nbsp; It is commonly seen, that men, once

<P>placed, take in with the&nbsp; contrary faction, to that

<P>by which they enter: thinking belike, that they

<P>have the first sure, and now are ready for a new

<P>purchase.&nbsp; The traitor in faction, lightly goeth

<P>away with it; for when matters have stuck long in

<P>balancing, the winning of some one man casteth

<P>them, and he getteth all the thanks.&nbsp; The even car-

<P>riage between two factions, proceedeth not always

<P>of moderation, but of a trueness to a man's self,

<P>with end to make use of both.&nbsp; Certainly in Italy,

<P>they hold it a little suspect in popes, when they

<P>have often in their mouth Padre commune: and

<P>take it to be a sign of one, that meaneth to refer all

<P>to the greatness of his own house.&nbsp; Kings had need

<P>beware, how they side themselves, and make

<P>themselves as of a faction or party; for leagues

<P>within the state, are ever pernicious to monarchies:

<P>for they raise an obligation, paramount to obliga-

<P>tion of sovereignty, and make the king tanquam

<P>unus ex nobis; as was to be seen in the League of

<P>France.&nbsp; When factions are carried too high and too

<P>violently, it is a sign of weakness in princes; and

<P>much to the prejudice, both of their authority and

<P>business.&nbsp; The motions of factions under kings

<P>ought to be, like the motions (as the astronomers

<P>speak) of the inferior orbs, which may have their

<P>proper motions, but yet still are quietly carried, by

<P>the higher motion of primum mobile.
