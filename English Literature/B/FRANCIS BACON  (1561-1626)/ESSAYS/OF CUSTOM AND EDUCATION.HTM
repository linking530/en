<P>MEN'S thoughts, are much according to their

<P>inclination; their discourse and speeches,

<P>according to their learning and infused opinions;

<P>but their deeds, are after as they have been accus-

<P>tomed.&nbsp; And therefore, as Machiavel well noteth

<P>(though in an evil-favored instance), there is no

<P>trusting to the force of nature, nor to the bravery

<P>of words, except it be corroborate by custom.&nbsp; His

<P>instance is, that for the achieving of a desperate

<P>conspiracy, a man should not rest upon the fierce-

<P>ness of any man's nature, or his resolute under-

<P>takings; but take such an one, as hath had his

<P>hands formerly in blood.&nbsp; But Machiavel knew not

<P>of a Friar Clement, nor a Ravillac, nor a Jaureguy,

<P>nor a Baltazar Gerard; yet his rule holdeth still,

<P>that nature, nor the engagement of words, are not

<P>so forcible, as custom.&nbsp; Only superstition is now so

<P>well advanced, that men of the first blood, are as

<P>firm as butchers by occupation; and votary reso-

<P>lution, is made equipollent to custom, even in mat-

<P>ter of blood.&nbsp; In other things, the predominancy of

<P>custom is everywhere visible; insomuch as a man

<P>would wonder, to hear men profess, protest, en-

<P>gage, give great words, and then do, just as they

<P>have done before; as if they were dead images,

<P>and engines moved only by the wheels of custom.

<P>We see also the reign or tyranny of custom, what

<P>it is.&nbsp; The Indians (I mean the sect of their wise men)

<P>lay themselves quietly upon a stock of wood, and

<P>so sacrifice themselves by fire.&nbsp; Nay, the wives

<P>strive to be burned, with the corpses of their hus-

<P>bands.&nbsp; The lads of Sparta, of ancient time, were

<P>wont to be scourged upon the altar of Diana, with-

<P>out so much as queching.&nbsp; I remember, in the be-

<P>ginning of Queen Elizabeth's time of England, an

<P>Irish rebel condemned, put up a petition to the

<P>deputy, that he might be hanged in a withe, and

<P>not in an halter; because it had been so used, with

<P>former rebels.&nbsp; There be monks in Russia, for pen-

<P>ance, that will sit a whole night in a vessel of water,

<P>till they be engaged with hard ice.&nbsp; Many examples

<P>may be put of the force of custom, both upon mind

<P>and body.&nbsp; Therefore, since custom is the principal

<P>magistrate of man's life, let men by all means en-

<P>deavor, to obtain good customs.&nbsp; Certainly custom

<P>is most perfect, when it beginneth in young years:

<P>this we call education; which is, in effect, but an

<P>early custom.&nbsp; So we see, in languages, the tongue

<P>is more pliant to all expressions and sounds, the

<P>joints are more supple, to all feats of activity and

<P>motions,&nbsp; in youth than afterwards.&nbsp; For it is true,

<P>that late learners cannot so well take the ply; ex-

<P>cept it be in some minds, that have not suffered

<P>themselves to fix, but have kept themselves open,

<P>and prepared to receive continual amendment,

<P>which is exceeding rare.&nbsp; But if the force of cus-

<P>tom simple and separate, be great, the force of

<P>custom copulate and conjoined and collegiate, is

<P>far greater.&nbsp; For there example teacheth, company

<P>comforteth, emulation quickeneth, glory raiseth:

<P>so as in such places the force of custom is in his

<P>exaltation.&nbsp; Certainly the great multiplication of

<P>virtues upon human nature, resteth upon socie-

<P>ties well ordained and disciplined.&nbsp; For common-

<P>wealths, and good governments, do nourish virtue

<P>grown but do not much mend the deeds.&nbsp; But the

<P>misery is, that the most effectual means, are now

<P>applied to the ends, least to be desired.
