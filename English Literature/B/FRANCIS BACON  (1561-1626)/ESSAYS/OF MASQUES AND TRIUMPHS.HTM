<P>THESE things are but toys, to come amongst

<P>such serious observations.&nbsp; But yet, since

<P>princes will have such things, it is better they

<P>should be graced with elegancy, than daubed with

<P>cost.&nbsp; Dancing to song, is a thing of great state and

<P>pleasure.&nbsp; I understand it, that the song be in quire,

<P>placed aloft, and accompanied with some broken

<P>music; and the ditty fitted to the device.&nbsp; Acting in

<P>song, especially in dialogues, hath an extreme

<P>good grace; I say acting, not dancing (for that is a

<P>mean and vulgar thing); and the voices of the dia-

<P>logue would be strong and manly (a base and a

<P>tenor; no treble); and the ditty high and tragical;

<P>not nice or dainty.&nbsp; Several quires, placed one over

<P>against another, and taking the voice by catches,

<P>anthem-wise, give great pleasure.&nbsp; Turning dances

<P>into figure, is a childish curiosity.&nbsp; And generally

<P>let it be noted, that those things which I here set

<P>down, are such as do naturally take the sense, and

<P>not respect petty wonderments.&nbsp; It is true, the al-

<P>terations of scenes, so it be quietly and without

<P>noise, are things of great beauty and pleasure; for

<P>they feed and relieve the eye, before it be full of

<P>the same object.&nbsp; Let the scenes abound with light,

<P>specially colored and varied; and let the masquers,

<P>or any other, that are to come down from the

<P>scene, have some motions upon the scene itself,

<P>before their coming down; for it draws the eye

<P>strangely, and makes it, with great pleasure, to

<P>desire to see, that it cannot perfectly discern.&nbsp; Let

<P>the songs be loud and cheerful, and not chirpings

<P>or pulings.&nbsp; Let the music likewise be sharp and

<P>loud, and well placed.&nbsp; The colors that show best by

<P>candle-light are white, carnation, and a kind of

<P>sea-water-green; and oes, or spangs, as they are of

<P>no great cost, so they are of most glory.&nbsp; As for rich

<P>embroidery, it is lost and not discerned.&nbsp; Let the

<P>suits of the masquers be graceful, and such as be-

<P>come the person, when the vizors are off; not after

<P>examples of known attires; Turke, soldiers, mari-

<P>ners', and the like.&nbsp; Let anti-masques not be long;

<P>they have been commonly of fools, satyrs, baboons,

<P>wild-men, antics, beasts, sprites, witches, Ethiops,

<P>pigmies, turquets, nymphs, rustics, Cupids, statuas

<P>moving, and the like.&nbsp; As for angels, it is not comi-

<P>cal enough, to put them in anti-masques; and

<P>anything that is hideous, as devils, giants, is on

<P>the other side as unfit.&nbsp; But chiefly, let the music

<P>of them be recreative, and with some strange

<P>changes.&nbsp; Some sweet odors suddenly coming forth,

<P>without any drops falling, are, in such a company

<P>as there is steam and heat, things of great pleasure

<P>and refreshment.&nbsp; Double masques, one of men,

<P>another of ladies, addeth state and variety.&nbsp; But all

<P>is nothing except the room be kept clear and neat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For justs, and tourneys, and barriers; the glories

<P>of them are chiefly in the chariots, wherein the

<P>challengers make their entry; especially if they

<P>be drawn with strange beasts: as lions, bears,

<P>camels, and the like; or in the devices of their en-

<P>trance; or in the bravery of their liveries; or in the

<P>goodly furniture of their horses and armor.&nbsp; But

<P>enough of these toys.
