The Auld Farmer's New-Year-Morning Salutation To His Auld Mare, Maggie



On giving her the accustomed ripp of corn to hansel in the New Year.



A Guid New-year I wish thee, Maggie!

Hae, there's a ripp to thy auld baggie:

Tho' thou's howe-backit now, an' knaggie,

I've seen the day

Thou could hae gaen like ony staggie,

Out-owre the lay.



Tho' now thou's dowie, stiff, an' crazy,

An' thy auld hide as white's a daisie,

I've seen thee dappl't, sleek an' glaizie,

A bonie gray:

He should been tight that daur't to raize thee,

Ance in a day.



Thou ance was i' the foremost rank,

A filly buirdly, steeve, an' swank;

An' set weel down a shapely shank,

As e'er tread yird;

An' could hae flown out-owre a stank,

Like ony bird.



It's now some nine-an'-twenty year,

Sin' thou was my guid-father's mear;

He gied me thee, o' tocher clear,

An' fifty mark;

Tho' it was sma', 'twas weel-won gear,

An' thou was stark.



When first I gaed to woo my Jenny,

Ye then was trotting wi' your minnie:

Tho' ye was trickie, slee, an' funnie,

Ye ne'er was donsie;

But hamely, tawie, quiet, an' cannie,

An' unco sonsie.



That day, ye pranc'd wi' muckle pride,

When ye bure hame my bonie bride:

An' sweet an' gracefu' she did ride,

Wi' maiden air!

Kyle-Stewart I could bragged wide

For sic a pair.



Tho' now ye dow but hoyte and hobble,

An' wintle like a saumont coble,

That day, ye was a jinker noble,

For heels an' win'!

An' ran them till they a' did wauble,

Far, far, behin'!



When thou an' I were young an' skeigh,

An' stable-meals at fairs were dreigh,

How thou wad prance, and snore, an' skreigh

An' tak the road!

Town's-bodies ran, an' stood abeigh,

An' ca't thee mad.



When thou was corn't, an' I was mellow,

We took the road aye like a swallow:

At brooses thou had ne'er a fellow,

For pith an' speed;

But ev'ry tail thou pay't them hollowm

Whare'er thou gaed.



The sma', droop-rumpl't, hunter cattle

Might aiblins waur't thee for a brattle;

But sax Scotch mile, thou try't their mettle,

An' gar't them whaizle:

Nae whip nor spur, but just a wattle

O' saugh or hazel.



Thou was a noble fittie-lan',

As e'er in tug or tow was drawn!

Aft thee an' I, in aught hours' gaun,

In guid March-weather,

Hae turn'd sax rood beside our han',

For days thegither.



Thou never braing't, an' fetch't, an' fliskit;

But thy auld tail thou wad hae whiskit,

An' spread abreed thy weel-fill'd brisket,

Wi' pith an' power;

Till sprittie knowes wad rair't an' riskit

An' slypet owre.



When frosts lay lang, an' snaws were deep,

An' threaten'd labour back to keep,

I gied thy cog a wee bit heap

Aboon the timmer:

I ken'd my Maggie wad na sleep,

For that, or simmer.



In cart or car thou never reestit;

The steyest brae thou wad hae fac't it;

Thou never lap, an' sten't, and breastit,

Then stood to blaw;

But just thy step a wee thing hastit,

Thou snoov't awa.



My pleugh is now thy bairn-time a',

Four gallant brutes as e'er did draw;

Forbye sax mae I've sell't awa,

That thou hast nurst:

They drew me thretteen pund an' twa,

The vera warst.



Mony a sair daurk we twa hae wrought,

An' wi' the weary warl' fought!

An' mony an anxious day, I thought

We wad be beat!

Yet here to crazy age we're brought,

Wi' something yet.



An' think na', my auld trusty servan',

That now perhaps thou's less deservin,

An' thy auld days may end in starvin;

For my last fow,

A heapit stimpart, I'll reserve ane

Laid by for you.



We've worn to crazy years thegither;

We'll toyte about wi' ane anither;

Wi' tentie care I'll flit thy tether

To some hain'd rig,

Whare ye may nobly rax your leather,

Wi' sma' fatigue.



The Twa Dogs^1



A Tale



'Twas in that place o' Scotland's isle,

That bears the name o' auld King Coil,

Upon a bonie day in June,

When wearin' thro' the afternoon,

Twa dogs, that were na thrang at hame,

Forgather'd ance upon a time.



The first I'll name, they ca'd him Caesar,

Was keepit for His Honor's pleasure:

His hair, his size, his mouth, his lugs,

Shew'd he was nane o' Scotland's dogs;

But whalpit some place far abroad,

Whare sailors gang to fish for cod.



His locked, letter'd, braw brass collar

Shew'd him the gentleman an' scholar;

But though he was o' high degree,

The fient a pride, nae pride had he;

But wad hae spent an hour caressin,

Ev'n wi' al tinkler-gipsy's messin:

At kirk or market, mill or smiddie,

Nae tawted tyke, tho' e'er sae duddie,

But he wad stan't, as glad to see him,

An' stroan't on stanes an' hillocks wi' him.



The tither was a ploughman's collie-

A rhyming, ranting, raving billie,

Wha for his friend an' comrade had him,

And in freak had Luath ca'd him,

After some dog in Highland Sang,^2

Was made lang syne,-Lord knows how lang.



He was a gash an' faithfu' tyke,

As ever lap a sheugh or dyke.

His honest, sonsie, baws'nt face

Aye gat him friends in ilka place;

His breast was white, his touzie back

Weel clad wi' coat o' glossy black;

His gawsie tail, wi' upward curl,

Hung owre his hurdie's wi' a swirl.



[Footnote 1: Luath was Burns' own dog.]



[Footnote 2: Luath, Cuchullin's dog in Ossian's "Fingal."-R. B.]



Nae doubt but they were fain o' ither,

And unco pack an' thick thegither;

Wi' social nose whiles snuff'd an' snowkit;

Whiles mice an' moudieworts they howkit;

Whiles scour'd awa' in lang excursion,

An' worry'd ither in diversion;

Until wi' daffin' weary grown

Upon a knowe they set them down.

An' there began a lang digression.

About the "lords o' the creation."



Caesar



I've aften wonder'd, honest Luath,

What sort o' life poor dogs like you have;

An' when the gentry's life I saw,

What way poor bodies liv'd ava.



Our laird gets in his racked rents,

His coals, his kane, an' a' his stents:

He rises when he likes himsel';

His flunkies answer at the bell;

He ca's his coach; he ca's his horse;

He draws a bonie silken purse,

As lang's my tail, where, thro' the steeks,

The yellow letter'd Geordie keeks.



Frae morn to e'en, it's nought but toiling

At baking, roasting, frying, boiling;

An' tho' the gentry first are stechin,

Yet ev'n the ha' folk fill their pechan

Wi' sauce, ragouts, an' sic like trashtrie,

That's little short o' downright wastrie.

Our whipper-in, wee, blasted wonner,

Poor, worthless elf, it eats a dinner,

Better than ony tenant-man

His Honour has in a' the lan':

An' what poor cot-folk pit their painch in,

I own it's past my comprehension.



Luath



Trowth, Caesar, whiles they're fash't eneugh:

A cottar howkin in a sheugh,

Wi' dirty stanes biggin a dyke,

Baring a quarry, an' sic like;

Himsel', a wife, he thus sustains,

A smytrie o' wee duddie weans,

An' nought but his han'-daurk, to keep

Them right an' tight in thack an' rape.



An' when they meet wi' sair disasters,

Like loss o' health or want o' masters,

Ye maist wad think, a wee touch langer,

An' they maun starve o' cauld an' hunger:

But how it comes, I never kent yet,

They're maistly wonderfu' contented;

An' buirdly chiels, an' clever hizzies,

Are bred in sic a way as this is.



Caesar



But then to see how ye're negleckit,

How huff'd, an' cuff'd, an' disrespeckit!

Lord man, our gentry care as little

For delvers, ditchers, an' sic cattle;

They gang as saucy by poor folk,

As I wad by a stinkin brock.



I've notic'd, on our laird's court-day, -

An' mony a time my heart's been wae, -

Poor tenant bodies, scant o'cash,

How they maun thole a factor's snash;

He'll stamp an' threaten, curse an' swear

He'll apprehend them, poind their gear;

While they maun stan', wi' aspect humble,

An' hear it a', an' fear an' tremble!



I see how folk live that hae riches;

But surely poor-folk maun be wretches!



Luath



They're no sae wretched's ane wad think.

Tho' constantly on poortith's brink,

They're sae accustom'd wi' the sight,

The view o't gives them little fright.



Then chance and fortune are sae guided,

They're aye in less or mair provided:

An' tho' fatigued wi' close employment,

A blink o' rest's a sweet enjoyment.



The dearest comfort o' their lives,

Their grushie weans an' faithfu' wives;

The prattling things are just their pride,

That sweetens a' their fire-side.



An' whiles twalpennie worth o' nappy

Can mak the bodies unco happy:

They lay aside their private cares,

To mind the Kirk and State affairs;

They'll talk o' patronage an' priests,

Wi' kindling fury i' their breasts,

Or tell what new taxation's comin,

An' ferlie at the folk in Lon'on.



As bleak-fac'd Hallowmass returns,

They get the jovial, rantin kirns,

When rural life, of ev'ry station,

Unite in common recreation;

Love blinks, Wit slaps, an' social Mirth

Forgets there's Care upo' the earth.



That merry day the year begins,

They bar the door on frosty win's;

The nappy reeks wi' mantling ream,

An' sheds a heart-inspiring steam;

The luntin pipe, an' sneeshin mill,

Are handed round wi' right guid will;

The cantie auld folks crackin crouse,

The young anes rantin thro' the house-

My heart has been sae fain to see them,

That I for joy hae barkit wi' them.



Still it's owre true that ye hae said,

Sic game is now owre aften play'd;

There's mony a creditable stock

O' decent, honest, fawsont folk,

Are riven out baith root an' branch,

Some rascal's pridefu' greed to quench,

Wha thinks to knit himsel the faster

In favour wi' some gentle master,

Wha, aiblins, thrang a parliamentin,

For Britain's guid his saul indentin-



Caesar



Haith, lad, ye little ken about it:

For Britain's guid! guid faith! I doubt it.

Say rather, gaun as Premiers lead him:

An' saying ay or no's they bid him:

At operas an' plays parading,

Mortgaging, gambling, masquerading:

Or maybe, in a frolic daft,

To Hague or Calais takes a waft,

To mak a tour an' tak a whirl,

To learn bon ton, an' see the worl'.



There, at Vienna, or Versailles,

He rives his father's auld entails;

Or by Madrid he takes the rout,

To thrum guitars an' fecht wi' nowt;

Or down Italian vista startles,



Whore-hunting amang groves o' myrtles:

Then bowses drumlie German-water,

To mak himsel look fair an' fatter,

An' clear the consequential sorrows,

Love-gifts of Carnival signoras.



For Britain's guid! for her destruction!

Wi' dissipation, feud, an' faction.



Luath



Hech, man! dear sirs! is that the gate

They waste sae mony a braw estate!

Are we sae foughten an' harass'd

For gear to gang that gate at last?



O would they stay aback frae courts,

An' please themsels wi' country sports,

It wad for ev'ry ane be better,

The laird, the tenant, an' the cotter!

For thae frank, rantin, ramblin billies,

Feint haet o' them's ill-hearted fellows;

Except for breakin o' their timmer,

Or speakin lightly o' their limmer,

Or shootin of a hare or moor-cock,

The ne'er-a-bit they're ill to poor folk,



But will ye tell me, Master Caesar,

Sure great folk's life's a life o' pleasure?

Nae cauld nor hunger e'er can steer them,

The very thought o't need na fear them.



Caesar



Lord, man, were ye but whiles whare I am,

The gentles, ye wad ne'er envy them!



It's true, they need na starve or sweat,

Thro' winter's cauld, or simmer's heat:

They've nae sair wark to craze their banes,

An' fill auld age wi' grips an' granes:

But human bodies are sic fools,

For a' their colleges an' schools,

That when nae real ills perplex them,

They mak enow themsel's to vex them;

An' aye the less they hae to sturt them,

In like proportion, less will hurt them.



A country fellow at the pleugh,

His acre's till'd, he's right eneugh;

A country girl at her wheel,

Her dizzen's dune, she's unco weel;

But gentlemen, an' ladies warst,

Wi' ev'n-down want o' wark are curst.

They loiter, lounging, lank an' lazy;

Tho' deil-haet ails them, yet uneasy;

Their days insipid, dull, an' tasteless;

Their nights unquiet, lang, an' restless.



An'ev'n their sports, their balls an' races,

Their galloping through public places,

There's sic parade, sic pomp, an' art,

The joy can scarcely reach the heart.



The men cast out in party-matches,

Then sowther a' in deep debauches.

Ae night they're mad wi' drink an' whoring,

Niest day their life is past enduring.



The ladies arm-in-arm in clusters,

As great an' gracious a' as sisters;

But hear their absent thoughts o' ither,

They're a' run-deils an' jads thegither.

Whiles, owre the wee bit cup an' platie,

They sip the scandal-potion pretty;

Or lee-lang nights, wi' crabbit leuks

Pore owre the devil's pictur'd beuks;

Stake on a chance a farmer's stackyard,

An' cheat like ony unhanged blackguard.



There's some exceptions, man an' woman;

But this is gentry's life in common.



By this, the sun was out of sight,

An' darker gloamin brought the night;

The bum-clock humm'd wi' lazy drone;

The kye stood rowtin i' the loan;

When up they gat an' shook their lugs,

Rejoic'd they werena men but dogs;

An' each took aff his several way,

Resolv'd to meet some ither day.



The Author's Earnest Cry And Prayer



     To the Right Honourable and Honourable Scotch Representatives in the

House of Commons.^1



Dearest of distillation! last and best-

-How art thou lost!-



Parody on Milton.



Ye Irish lords, ye knights an' squires,

Wha represent our brughs an' shires,

An' doucely manage our affairs

In parliament,

To you a simple poet's pray'rs

Are humbly sent.



Alas! my roupit Muse is hearse!

Your Honours' hearts wi' grief 'twad pierce,

To see her sittin on her arse

Low i' the dust,

And scriechinhout prosaic verse,

An like to brust!



[ Footnote 1": This was written before the Act anent the Scotch distilleries,

of session 1786, for which Scotland and the author return their most grateful

thanks.-R. B.]



Tell them wha hae the chief direction,

Scotland an' me's in great affliction,

E'er sin' they laid that curst restriction

On aqua-vitae;

An' rouse them up to strong conviction,

An' move their pity.



Stand forth an' tell yon Premier youth

The honest, open, naked truth:

Tell him o' mine an' Scotland's drouth,

His servants humble:

The muckle deevil blaw you south

If ye dissemble!



Does ony great man glunch an' gloom?

Speak out, an' never fash your thumb!

Let posts an' pensions sink or soom

Wi' them wha grant them;

If honestly they canna come,

Far better want them.



In gath'rin votes you were na slack;

Now stand as tightly by your tack:

Ne'er claw your lug, an' fidge your back,

An' hum an' haw;

But raise your arm, an' tell your crack

Before them a'.



Paint Scotland greetin owre her thrissle;

Her mutchkin stowp as toom's a whissle;

An' damn'd excisemen in a bussle,

Seizin a stell,

Triumphant crushin't like a mussel,

Or limpet shell!



Then, on the tither hand present her-

A blackguard smuggler right behint her,

An' cheek-for-chow, a chuffie vintner

Colleaguing join,

Picking her pouch as bare as winter

Of a' kind coin.



Is there, that bears the name o' Scot,

But feels his heart's bluid rising hot,

To see his poor auld mither's pot

Thus dung in staves,

An' plunder'd o' her hindmost groat

By gallows knaves?



Alas! I'm but a nameless wight,

Trode i' the mire out o' sight?

But could I like Montgomeries fight,

Or gab like Boswell,^2

There's some sark-necks I wad draw tight,

An' tie some hose well.



God bless your Honours! can ye see't-

The kind, auld cantie carlin greet,

An' no get warmly to your feet,

An' gar them hear it,

An' tell them wi'a patriot-heat

Ye winna bear it?



Some o' you nicely ken the laws,

To round the period an' pause,

An' with rhetoric clause on clause

To mak harangues;

Then echo thro' Saint Stephen's wa's

Auld Scotland's wrangs.

Wi' hasty summon;

Hae ye a leisure-moment's time

To hear what's comin?



Some rhyme a neibor's name to lash;

Some rhyme (vain thought!) for needfu' cash;

Some rhyme to court the countra clash,

An' raise a din;

For me, an aim I never fash;

I rhyme for fun.



The star that rules my luckless lot,

Has fated me the russet coat,

An' damn'd my fortune to the groat;

But, in requit,

Has blest me with a random-shot

O'countra wit.



This while my notion's taen a sklent,

To try my fate in guid, black prent;

Their unknown pages."



Then farewell hopes of laurel-boughs,

To garland my poetic brows!

Henceforth I'll rove where busy ploughs

Are whistlin' thrang,

An' teach the lanely heights an' howes

My rustic sang.



I'll wander on, wi' tentless heed

How never-halting moments speed,

Till fate shall snap the brittle thread;

Then, all unknown,

I'll lay me with th' inglorious dead

Forgot and gone!



But why o' death being a tale?

Where Pleasure is the magic-wand,

Maks hours like minutes, hand in hand,

Dance by fu' light.



The magic-wand then let us wield;

For ance that five-an'-forty's speel'd,

See, crazy, weary, joyless eild,

Wi' wrinkl'd face,

Comes hostin, hirplin owre the field,

We' creepin pace.



When ance life's day draws near the gloamin,

An' fareweel cheerfu' tankards foamin,

An' social noise:

An' fareweel dear, deluding woman,

The Joy of joys!



O Life! how pleasant, in thy morning,

Young Fancy's rays the hills adorning!

Cold-pausing Caution's lesson scorning,

We frisk away,

Like school-boys, at th' expected warning,

To joy an' play.



We wander there, we wander here,

We eye the rose upon the brier,

Unmindful that the thorn is near,

Among the leaves;

And tho' the puny wound appear,

Short while it grieves.



Some, lucky, find a flow'ry spot,

For which they never toil'd nor swat;

They drink the sweet and eat the fat,

But care or pain;

And haply eye the barren hut

With high disdain.



With steady aim, some Fortune chase;

Keen hope does ev'ry sinew brace;

Thro' fair, thro' foul, they urge the race,

An' seize the prey:

Then cannie, in some cozie place,

They close the day.



And others, like your humble servan',

Poor wights! nae rules nor roads observin,

To right or left eternal swervin,

They zig-zag on;

Till, curst with age, obscure an' starvin,

They aften groan.



Alas! what bitter toil an' straining-

But truce with peevish, poor complaining!

Is fortune's fickle Luna waning?

E'n let her gang!

Beneath what light she has remaining,

Let's sing our sang.



My pen I here fling to the door,

And kneel, ye Pow'rs! and warm implore,

"Tho' I should wander Terra o'er,

How much unlike!

Your hearts are just a standing pool,

Your lives, a dyke!



Nae hair-brain'd, sentimental traces

In your unletter'd, nameless faces!

In arioso trills and graces

Ye never stray;

But gravissimo, solemn basses

Ye hum away.



Ye are sae grave, nae doubt ye're wise;

Nae ferly tho' ye do despise

The hairum-scairum, ram-stam boys,

The rattling squad:

Ye ken the road!

Duan First^1

To kail-yards green,

While faithless snaws ilk step betray

Whare she has been.



The thresher's weary flingin-tree,

The lee-lang day had tired me;

And when the day had clos'd his e'e,

Far i' the west,

Ben i' the spence, right pensivelie,

I gaed to rest.



There, lanely by the ingle-cheek,

I sat and ey'd the spewing reek,

That fill'd, wi' hoast-provoking smeek,

The auld clay biggin;

An' heard the restless rattons squeak

About the riggin.



All in this mottie, misty clime,

I backward mus'd on wasted time,

How I had spent my youthfu' prime,

An' done nae thing,

But stringing blethers up in rhyme,

For fools to sing.



Had I to guid advice but harkit,

I might, by this, hae led a market,

I started, mutt'ring, "blockhead! coof!"

And heav'd on high my waukit loof,

To swear by a' yon starry roof,

Or some rash aith,

That I henceforth wad be rhyme-proof

Till my last breath-



When click! the string the snick did draw;

An' jee! the door gaed to the wa';

An' by my ingle-lowe I saw,

Now bleezin bright,

A tight, outlandish hizzie, braw,

Come full in sight.



Ye need na doubt, I held my whisht;

The infant aith, half-form'd, was crusht

I glowr'd as eerie's I'd been dusht

In some wild glen;

When sweet, like honest Worth, she blusht,

An' stepped ben.



Green, slender, leaf-clad holly-boughs

Were twisted, gracefu', round her brows;

I took her for some Scottish Muse,

By that same token;

And come to stop those reckless vows,

Would soon been broken.



A "hair-brain'd, sentimental trace"

Was strongly marked in her face;

A wildly-witty, rustic grace

Shone full upon her;

Her eye, ev'n turn'd on empty space,

Beam'd keen with honour.



Down flow'd her robe, a tartan sheen,

Till half a leg was scrimply seen;

An' such a leg! my bonie Jean

Could only peer it;

Sae straught, sae taper, tight an' clean-

Nane else came near it.



Her mantle large, of greenish hue,

My gazing wonder chiefly drew:

Deep lights and shades, bold-mingling, threw

A lustre grand;

And seem'd, to my astonish'd view,

A well-known land.



Here, rivers in the sea were lost;

There, mountains to the skies were toss't:

Here, tumbling billows mark'd the coast,

With surging foam;

There, distant shone Art's lofty boast,

The lordly dome.



Here, Doon pour'd down his far-fetch'd floods;

There, well-fed Irwine stately thuds:

Auld hermit Ayr staw thro' his woods,

On to the shore;

And many a lesser torrent scuds,

With seeming roar.



Low, in a sandy valley spread,

An ancient borough rear'd her head;

Still, as in Scottish story read,

She boasts a race

To ev'ry nobler virtue bred,

And polish'd grace.^2



By stately tow'r, or palace fair,

Or ruins pendent in the air,

Bold stems of heroes, here and there,

I could discern;

With feature stern.



My heart did glowing transport feel,

To see a race heroic^3 wheel,

     After 18th stanza of the text (at "His native land"):-



With secret throes I marked that earth,

That cottage, witness of my birth;

And near I saw, bold issuing forth

In youthful pride,

A Lindsay race of noble worth,

Famed far and wide.



Where, hid behind a spreading wood,

An ancient Pict-built mansion stood,

I spied, among an angel brood,

A female pair;

Sweet shone their high maternal blood,

And father's air.^1



An ancient tower^2 to memory brought

How Dettingen's bold hero fought;

Still, far from sinking into nought,

Who far in western climates fought,

With trusty sword.

That owned me frater.^3



     After 20th stanza of the text (at "Dispensing good"):-



Near by arose a mansion fine^4

The seat of many a muse divine;

Not rustic muses such as mine,

With holly crown'd,

But th' ancient, tuneful, laurell'd Nine,

From classic ground.



I mourn'd the card that Fortune dealt,

To see where bonie Whitefoords dwelt;^5

But other prospects made me melt,

That village near;^6

There Nature, Friendship, Love, I felt,

Fond-mingling, dear!



Hail! Nature's pang, more strong than death!

Warm Friendship's glow, like kindling wrath!

Love, dearer than the parting breath

Of dying friend!

Not ev'n with life's wild devious path,

Your force shall end!



The Power that gave the soft alarms

In blooming Whitefoord's rosy charms,

And maun I still, &c.



And when the lark, 'tween light and dark,

Blythe waukens by the daisy's side,

And mounts and sings on flittering wings,

A woe-worn ghaist I hameward glide.

And maun I still, &c.



Come winter, with thine angry howl,

And raging, bend the naked tree;

Thy gloom will soothe my cheerless soul,

When nature all is sad like me!

And maun I still, &c.



To A Mountain Daisy,



     On turning down with the Plough, in April, 1786.



Wee, modest crimson-tipped flow'r,

Thou's met me in an evil hour;

For I maun crush amang the stoure

Thy slender stem:

To spare thee now is past my pow'r,

Thou bonie gem.



Alas! it's no thy neibor sweet,

The bonie lark, companion meet,

Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet,

Wi' spreckl'd breast!

When upward-springing, blythe, to greet

The purpling east.



Cauld blew the bitter-biting north

Upon thy early, humble birth;

Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth

Amid the storm,

Scarce rear'd above the parent-earth

Thy tender form.



The flaunting flow'rs our gardens yield,

High shelt'ring woods and wa's maun shield;

But thou, beneath the random bield

O' clod or stane,

Adorns the histie stibble field,

Unseen, alane.



There, in thy scanty mantle clad,

Thy snawie bosom sun-ward spread,

Thou lifts thy unassuming head

In humble guise;

But now the share uptears thy bed,

And low thou lies!



Such is the fate of artless maid,

Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!

By love's simplicity betray'd,

And guileless trust;

Till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid

Low i' the dust.



Such is the fate of simple bard,

On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd!

Unskilful he to note the card

Of prudent lore,

Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,

And whelm him o'er!



Such fate to suffering worth is giv'n,

Who long with wants and woes has striv'n,

By human pride or cunning driv'n

To mis'ry's brink;

Till wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n,

He, ruin'd, sink!



Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate,

That fate is thine-no distant date;

Stern Ruin's plough-share drives elate,

Full on thy bloom,

Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight,

Shall be thy doom!



To Ruin



All hail! inexorable lord!

At whose destruction-breathing word,

The mightiest empires fall!

Thy cruel, woe-delighted train,

The ministers of grief and pain,

A sullen welcome, all!



With stern-resolv'd, despairing eye,

I see each aimed dart;

For one has cut my dearest tie,

And quivers in my heart.

Then low'ring, and pouring,

The storm no more I dread;

Tho' thick'ning, and black'ning,

Round my devoted head.



And thou grim Pow'r by life abhorr'd,

While life a pleasure can afford,

Oh! hear a wretch's pray'r!

Nor more I shrink appall'd, afraid;

I court, I beg thy friendly aid,

To close this scene of care!

When shall my soul, in silent peace,

Resign life's joyless day-

My weary heart is throbbing cease,

Cold mould'ring in the clay?

No fear more, no tear more,

To stain my lifeless face,

Enclasped, and grasped,

Within thy cold embrace!



The Lament



     Occasioned by the unfortunate issue of a Friend's Amour.



Alas! how oft does goodness would itself,

And sweet affection prove the spring of woe!



Home.



O thou pale orb that silent shines

While care-untroubled mortals sleep!

Thou seest a wretch who inly pines.

And wanders here to wail and weep!

With woe I nightly vigils keep,

Beneath thy wan, unwarming beam;

And mourn, in lamentation deep,

How life and love are all a dream!



I joyless view thy rays adorn

The faintly-marked, distant hill;

I joyless view thy trembling horn,

Reflected in the gurgling rill:

My fondly-fluttering heart, be still!

Thou busy pow'r, remembrance, cease!

Ah! must the agonizing thrill

For ever bar returning peace!



No idly-feign'd, poetic pains,

My sad, love-lorn lamentings claim:

No shepherd's pipe-Arcadian strains;

No fabled tortures, quaint and tame.

The plighted faith, the mutual flame,

The oft-attested pow'rs above,

The promis'd father's tender name;

These were the pledges of my love!



Encircled in her clasping arms,

How have the raptur'd moments flown!

How have I wish'd for fortune's charms,

For her dear sake, and her's alone!

And, must I think it! is she gone,

My secret heart's exulting boast?

And does she heedless hear my groan?

And is she ever, ever lost?



Oh! can she bear so base a heart,

So lost to honour, lost to truth,

As from the fondest lover part,

The plighted husband of her youth?

Alas! life's path may be unsmooth!

Her way may lie thro' rough distress!

Then, who her pangs and pains will soothe

Her sorrows share, and make them less?



Ye winged hours that o'er us pass'd,

Enraptur'd more, the more enjoy'd,

Your dear remembrance in my breast

My fondly-treasur'd thoughts employ'd:

That breast, how dreary now, and void,

For her too scanty once of room!

Ev'n ev'ry ray of hope destroy'd,

And not a wish to gild the gloom!



The morn, that warns th' approaching day,

Awakes me up to toil and woe;

I see the hours in long array,

That I must suffer, lingering, slow:

Full many a pang, and many a throe,

Keen recollection's direful train,

Must wring my soul, were Phoebus, low,

Shall kiss the distant western main.



And when my nightly couch I try,

Sore harass'd out with care and grief,

My toil-beat nerves, and tear-worn eye,

Keep watchings with the nightly thief:

Or if I slumber, fancy, chief,

Reigns, haggard-wild, in sore affright:

Ev'n day, all-bitter, brings relief

From such a horror-breathing night.



O thou bright queen, who o'er th' expanse

Now highest reign'st, with boundless sway

Oft has thy silent-marking glance

Observ'd us, fondly-wand'ring, stray!

The time, unheeded, sped away,

While love's luxurious pulse beat high,

Beneath thy silver-gleaming ray,

To mark the mutual-kindling eye.



Oh! scenes in strong remembrance set!

Scenes, never, never to return!

Scenes, if in stupor I forget,

Again I feel, again I burn!

From ev'ry joy and pleasure torn,

Life's weary vale I'll wander thro';

And hopeless, comfortless, I'll mourn

A faithless woman's broken vow!



Despondency: An Ode



Oppress'd with grief, oppress'd with care,

A burden more than I can bear,

I set me down and sigh;

O life! thou art a galling load,

Along a rough, a weary road,

To wretches such as I!

Dim backward as I cast my view,

What sick'ning scenes appear!

What sorrows yet may pierce me through,

Too justly I may fear!

Still caring, despairing,

Must be my bitter doom;

My woes here shall close ne'er

But with the closing tomb!



Happy! ye sons of busy life,

Who, equal to the bustling strife,

No other view regard!

Ev'n when the wished end's denied,

Yet while the busy means are plied,

They bring their own reward:

Whilst I, a hope-abandon'd wight,

Unfitted with an aim,

Meet ev'ry sad returning night,

And joyless morn the same!

You, bustling, and justling,

Forget each grief and pain;

I, listless, yet restless,

Find ev'ry prospect vain.



How blest the solitary's lot,

Who, all-forgetting, all forgot,

Within his humble cell,

The cavern, wild with tangling roots,

Sits o'er his newly gather'd fruits,

Beside his crystal well!

Or haply, to his ev'ning thought,

By unfrequented stream,

The ways of men are distant brought,

A faint, collected dream;

While praising, and raising

His thoughts to heav'n on high,

As wand'ring, meand'ring,

He views the solemn sky.



Than I, no lonely hermit plac'd

Where never human footstep trac'd,

Less fit to play the part,

The lucky moment to improve,

And just to stop, and just to move,

With self-respecting art:

But ah! those pleasures, loves, and joys,

Which I too keenly taste,

The solitary can despise,

Can want, and yet be blest!

He needs not, he heeds not,

Or human love or hate;

Whilst I here must cry here

At perfidy ingrate!



O, enviable, early days,

When dancing thoughtless pleasure's maze,

To care, to guilt unknown!

How ill exchang'd for riper times,

To feel the follies, or the crimes,

Of others, or my own!

Ye tiny elves that guiltless sport,

Like linnets in the bush,

Ye little know the ills ye court,

When manhood is your wish!

The losses, the crosses,

That active man engage;

The fears all, the tears all,

Of dim declining age!

Altho' I say't, he's gleg enough,

But then, wi' you, he'll be sae taught,

I hae na ony fear.

Ye'll catechise him, every quirk,

An' shore him weel wi' hell;

An' gar him follow to the kirk-

Aye when ye gang yoursel.

In faith he's sure to get him.

To phrase you and praise you,.

Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,

And leave auld Scotia's shore?

Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,

Across th' Atlantic roar?



O sweet grows the lime and the orange,

And the apple on the pine;

But a' the charms o' the Indies

I hae sworn by the Heavens to my Mary,

I hae sworn by the Heavens to be true;

When I forget my vow!



O plight me your faith, my Mary,

And plight me your lily-white hand;

O plight me your faith, my Mary,

Before I leave Scotia's strand.

O were yon hills and vallies mine,

Yon palace and yon gardens fine!

The world then the love should know

I bear my Highland Lassie, O.



But fickle fortune frowns on me,

And I maun cross the raging sea!

But while my crimson currents flow,

I'll love my Highland lassie, O.



Altho' thro' foreign climes I range,

I know her heart will never change,

For her bosom burns with honour's glow,

My faithful Highland lassie, O.



For her I'll dare the billow's roar,

For her I'll trace a distant shore,

That Indian wealth may lustre throw

Around my Highland lassie, O.



She has my heart, she has my hand,

By secret troth and honour's band!

Till the mortal stroke shall lay me low,

I'm thine, my Highland lassie, O.



Farewell the glen sae bushy, O!

Farewell the plain sae rashy, O!

To other lands I now must go,

To sing my Highland lassie, O.



Epistle To A Young Friend



     May __, 1786.



I Lang hae thought, my youthfu' friend,

A something to have sent you,

Tho' it should serve nae ither end

Than just a kind memento:

But how the subject-theme may gang,

Let time and chance determine;

Perhaps it may turn out a sang:

Perhaps turn out a sermon.



Ye'll try the world soon, my lad;

And, Andrew dear, believe me,

Ye'll find mankind an unco squad,

And muckle they may grieve ye:

For care and trouble set your thought,

Ev'n when your end's attained;

And a' your views may come to nought,

Where ev'ry nerve is strained.



I'll no say, men are villains a';

The real, harden'd wicked,

Wha hae nae check but human law,

Are to a few restricked;

But, Och! mankind are unco weak,

An' little to be trusted;

If self the wavering balance shake,

It's rarely right adjusted!



Yet they wha fa' in fortune's strife,

Their fate we shouldna censure;

For still, th' important end of life

They equally may answer;

A man may hae an honest heart,

Tho' poortith hourly stare him;

A man may tak a neibor's part,

Yet hae nae cash to spare him.



Aye free, aff-han', your story tell,

When wi' a bosom crony;

But still keep something to yoursel',

Ye scarcely tell to ony:

Conceal yoursel' as weel's ye can

Frae critical dissection;

But keek thro' ev'ry other man,

Wi' sharpen'd, sly inspection.



The sacred lowe o' weel-plac'd love,

Luxuriantly indulge it;

But never tempt th' illicit rove,

Tho' naething should divulge it:

I waive the quantum o' the sin,

The hazard of concealing;

But, Och! it hardens a' within,

And petrifies the feeling!



To catch dame Fortune's golden smile,

Assiduous wait upon her;

And gather gear by ev'ry wile

That's justified by honour;

Not for to hide it in a hedge,

Nor for a train attendant;

But for the glorious privilege

Of being independent.



The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip,

To haud the wretch in order;

But where ye feel your honour grip,

Let that aye be your border;

Its slightest touches, instant pause-

Debar a' side-pretences;

And resolutely keep its laws,

Uncaring consequences.



The great Creator to revere,

Must sure become the creature;

But still the preaching cant forbear,

And ev'n the rigid feature:

Yet ne'er with wits profane to range,

Be complaisance extended;

An atheist-laugh's a poor exchange

For Deity offended!



When ranting round in pleasure's ring,

Religion may be blinded;

Or if she gie a random sting,

It may be little minded;

But when on life we're tempest driv'n-

A conscience but a canker-

A correspondence fix'd wi' Heav'n,

Is sure a noble anchor!



Adieu, dear, amiable youth!

Your heart can ne'er be wanting!

May prudence, fortitude, and truth,

Erect your brow undaunting!

In ploughman phrase, "God send you speed,"

Still daily to grow wiser;

And may ye better reck the rede,

Then ever did th' adviser!



Address Of Beelzebub



     To the Right Honourable the Earl of Breadalbane, President of the Right

Honourable and Honourable the Highland Society, which met on the 23rd of May

last at the Shakespeare, Covent Garden, to concert ways and means to frustrate

the designs of five hundred Highlanders, who, as the Society were informed by

Mr. M'Kenzie of Applecross, were so audacious as to attempt an escape from

their lawful lords and masters whose property they were, by emigrating from

the lands of Mr. Macdonald of Glengary to the wilds of Canada, in search of

that fantastic thing-Liberty.



Long life, my Lord, an' health be yours,

Unskaithed by hunger'd Highland boors;

Lord grant me nae duddie, desperate beggar,

Wi' dirk, claymore, and rusty trigger,

May twin auld Scotland o' a life

She likes-as butchers like a knife.



Faith you and Applecross were right

To keep the Highland hounds in sight:

I doubt na! they wad bid nae better,

Than let them ance out owre the water,

Then up among thae lakes and seas,

They'll mak what rules and laws they please:

Some daring Hancocke, or a Franklin,

May set their Highland bluid a-ranklin;

Some Washington again may head them,

Or some Montgomery, fearless, lead them,

Till God knows what may be effected

When by such heads and hearts directed,

Poor dunghill sons of dirt and mire

May to Patrician rights aspire!

Nae sage North now, nor sager Sackville,

To watch and premier o'er the pack vile, -

An' whare will ye get Howes and Clintons

To bring them to a right repentance-

To cowe the rebel generation,

An' save the honour o' the nation?

They, an' be d-d! what right hae they

To meat, or sleep, or light o' day?

Far less-to riches, pow'r, or freedom,

But what your lordship likes to gie them?



But hear, my lord! Glengarry, hear!

Your hand's owre light to them, I fear;

Your factors, grieves, trustees, and bailies,

I canna say but they do gaylies;

They lay aside a' tender mercies,

An' tirl the hallions to the birses;

Yet while they're only poind't and herriet,

They'll keep their stubborn Highland spirit:

But smash them! crash them a' to spails,

An' rot the dyvors i' the jails!

The young dogs, swinge them to the labour;

Let wark an' hunger mak them sober!

The hizzies, if they're aughtlins fawsont,

Let them in Drury-lane be lesson'd!

An' if the wives an' dirty brats

Come thiggin at your doors an' yetts,

Flaffin wi' duds, an' grey wi' beas',

Frightin away your ducks an' geese;

Get out a horsewhip or a jowler,

The langest thong, the fiercest growler,

An' gar the tatter'd gypsies pack

Wi' a' their bastards on their back!

Go on, my Lord! I lang to meet you,

An' in my house at hame to greet you;

Wi' common lords ye shanna mingle,

The benmost neuk beside the ingle,

At my right han' assigned your seat,

'Tween Herod's hip an' Polycrate:

Or if you on your station tarrow,

Between Almagro and Pizarro,

A seat, I'm sure ye're well deservin't;

An' till ye come-your humble servant,

A Dream



Thoughts, words, and deeds, the Statute blames with reason;

But surely Dreams were ne'er indicted Treason.



     On reading, in the public papers, the Laureate's Ode, with the other

parade of June 4th, 1786, the Author was no sooner dropt asleep, than he

imagined himself transported to the Birth-day Levee: and, in his dreaming

fancy, made the following Address:



Guid-Mornin' to our Majesty!

May Heaven augment your blisses

On ev'ry new birth-day ye see,

A humble poet wishes.

My bardship here, at your Levee

On sic a day as this is,

Is sure an uncouth sight to see,

Amang thae birth-day dresses

Sae fine this day.



I see ye're complimented thrang,

By mony a lord an' lady;

"God save the King" 's a cuckoo sang

That's unco easy said aye:

The poets, too, a venal gang,

Wi' rhymes weel-turn'd an' ready,

Wad gar you trow ye ne'er do wrang,

But aye unerring steady,

On sic a day.



For me! before a monarch's face

Ev'n there I winna flatter;

For neither pension, post, nor place,

Am I your humble debtor:

So, nae reflection on your Grace,

Your Kingship to bespatter;

There's mony waur been o' the race,

And aiblins ane been better

Than you this day.



'Tis very true, my sovereign King,

My skill may weel be doubted;

But facts are chiels that winna ding,

An' downa be disputed:

Your royal nest, beneath your wing,

Is e'en right reft and clouted,

And now the third part o' the string,

An' less, will gang aboot it

Than did ae day.^1



Far be't frae me that I aspire

To blame your legislation,

Or say, ye wisdom want, or fire,

To rule this mighty nation:

But faith! I muckle doubt, my sire,

Ye've trusted ministration

To chaps wha in barn or byre

Wad better fill'd their station

Than courts yon day.



And now ye've gien auld Britain peace,

Her broken shins to plaister,

Your sair taxation does her fleece,

Till she has scarce a tester:

For me, thank God, my life's a lease,

Nae bargain wearin' faster,

Or, faith! I fear, that, wi' the geese,

I shortly boost to pasture

I' the craft some day.



[Footnote 1: The American colonies had recently been lost.]



I'm no mistrusting Willie Pitt,

When taxes he enlarges,

(An' Will's a true guid fallow's get,

A name not envy spairges),

That he intends to pay your debt,

An' lessen a' your charges;

But, God-sake! let nae saving fit

Abridge your bonie barges

An'boats this day.



Adieu, my Liege; may freedom geck

Beneath your high protection;

An' may ye rax Corruption's neck,

And gie her for dissection!

But since I'm here, I'll no neglect,

In loyal, true affection,

To pay your Queen, wi' due respect,

May fealty an' subjection

This great birth-day.



Hail, Majesty most Excellent!

While nobles strive to please ye,

Will ye accept a compliment,

A simple poet gies ye?

Thae bonie bairntime, Heav'n has lent,

Still higher may they heeze ye

In bliss, till fate some day is sent

For ever to release ye

Frae care that day.



For you, young Potentate o'Wales,

I tell your highness fairly,

Down Pleasure's stream, wi' swelling sails,

I'm tauld ye're driving rarely;

But some day ye may gnaw your nails,

An' curse your folly sairly,

That e'er ye brak Diana's pales,

Or rattl'd dice wi' Charlie

By night or day.



Yet aft a ragged cowt's been known,

To mak a noble aiver;

So, ye may doucely fill the throne,

For a'their clish-ma-claver:

There, him^2 at Agincourt wha shone,

Few better were or braver:

And yet, wi' funny, queer Sir John,^3

He was an unco shaver

For mony a day.



For you, right rev'rend Osnaburg,

Nane sets the lawn-sleeve sweeter,

Altho' a ribbon at your lug

Wad been a dress completer:

As ye disown yon paughty dog,

That bears the keys of Peter,

Then swith! an' get a wife to hug,

Or trowth, ye'll stain the mitre

Some luckless day!



Young, royal Tarry-breeks, I learn,

Ye've lately come athwart her-

A glorious galley,^4 stem and stern,

Weel rigg'd for Venus' barter;

But first hang out, that she'll discern,

Your hymeneal charter;

Then heave aboard your grapple airn,

An' large upon her quarter,

Come full that day.



Ye, lastly, bonie blossoms a',

Ye royal lasses dainty,

Heav'n mak you guid as well as braw,

An' gie you lads a-plenty!

But sneer na British boys awa!

For kings are unco scant aye,

An' German gentles are but sma',

They're better just than want aye

On ony day.

A Dedication



     To Gavin Hamilton, Esq.



Expect na, sir, in this narration,

A fleechin, fleth'rin Dedication,

To roose you up, an' ca' you guid,

An' sprung o' great an' noble bluid,

Because ye're surnam'd like His Grace-

Perhaps related to the race:

Then, when I'm tir'd-and sae are ye,

Wi' mony a fulsome, sinfu' lie,

Set up a face how I stop short,

For fear your modesty be hurt.



This may do-maun do, sir, wi' them wha

Maun please the great folk for a wamefou;

For me! sae laigh I need na bow,

For, Lord be thankit, I can plough;

And when I downa yoke a naig,

Then, Lord be thankit, I can beg;

Sae I shall say-an' that's nae flatt'rin-

It's just sic Poet an' sic Patron.



The Poet, some guid angel help him,

Or else, I fear, some ill ane skelp him!

He may do weel for a' he's done yet,

But only-he's no just begun yet.



The Patron (sir, ye maun forgie me;

I winna lie, come what will o' me),

On ev'ry hand it will allow'd be,

He's just-nae better than he should be.



I readily and freely grant,

He downa see a poor man want;

What's no his ain, he winna tak it;

What ance he says, he winna break it;

Ought he can lend he'll no refus't,

Till aft his guidness is abus'd;

And rascals whiles that do him wrang,

Ev'n that, he does na mind it lang;

As master, landlord, husband, father,

He does na fail his part in either.



But then, nae thanks to him for a'that;

Nae godly symptom ye can ca' that;

It's naething but a milder feature

Of our poor, sinfu' corrupt nature:

Ye'll get the best o' moral works,

'Mang black Gentoos, and pagan Turks,

Or hunters wild on Ponotaxi,

Wha never heard of orthodoxy.

That he's the poor man's friend in need,

The gentleman in word and deed,

It's no thro' terror of damnation;

It's just a carnal inclination.



Morality, thou deadly bane,

Thy tens o' thousands thou hast slain!

Vain is his hope, whase stay an' trust is

In moral mercy, truth, and justice!



No-stretch a point to catch a plack:

Abuse a brother to his back;

Steal through the winnock frae a whore,

But point the rake that taks the door;

Be to the poor like ony whunstane,

And haud their noses to the grunstane;

Ply ev'ry art o' legal thieving;

No matter-stick to sound believing.



Learn three-mile pray'rs, an' half-mile graces,

Wi' weel-spread looves, an' lang, wry faces;

Grunt up a solemn, lengthen'd groan,

And damn a' parties but your own;

I'll warrant they ye're nae deceiver,

A steady, sturdy, staunch believer.



O ye wha leave the springs o' Calvin,

For gumlie dubs of your ain delvin!

Ye sons of Heresy and Error,

Ye'll some day squeel in quaking terror,

When Vengeance draws the sword in wrath.

And in the fire throws the sheath;

When Ruin, with his sweeping besom,

Just frets till Heav'n commission gies him;

While o'er the harp pale Misery moans,

And strikes the ever-deep'ning tones,

Still louder shrieks, and heavier groans!



Your pardon, sir, for this digression:

I maist forgat my Dedication;

But when divinity comes 'cross me,

My readers still are sure to lose me.



So, sir, you see 'twas nae daft vapour;

But I maturely thought it proper,

When a' my works I did review,

To dedicate them, sir, to you:

Because (ye need na tak it ill),

I thought them something like yoursel'.



Then patronize them wi' your favor,

And your petitioner shall ever-

I had amaist said, ever pray,

But that's a word I need na say;

For prayin, I hae little skill o't,

I'm baith dead-sweer, an' wretched ill o't;

But I'se repeat each poor man's pray'r,

That kens or hears about you, sir-



"May ne'er Misfortune's gowling bark,

Howl thro' the dwelling o' the clerk!

May ne'er his genrous, honest heart,

For that same gen'rous spirit smart!

May Kennedy's far-honour'd name

Lang beet his hymeneal flame,

Till Hamiltons, at least a dizzen,

Are frae their nuptial labours risen:

Five bonie lasses round their table,

And sev'n braw fellows, stout an' able,

To serve their king an' country weel,

By word, or pen, or pointed steel!

May health and peace, with mutual rays,

Shine on the ev'ning o' his days;

Till his wee, curlie John's ier-oe,

When ebbing life nae mair shall flow,

The last, sad, mournful rites bestow!"



I will not wind a lang conclusion,

With complimentary effusion;

But, whilst your wishes and endeavours

Are blest with Fortune's smiles and favours,

I am, dear sir, with zeal most fervent,

Your much indebted, humble servant.



But if (which Pow'rs above prevent)

That iron-hearted carl, Want,

Attended, in his grim advances,

By sad mistakes, and black mischances,

While hopes, and joys, and pleasures fly him,

Make you as poor a dog as I am,

Your humble servant then no more;

For who would humbly serve the poor?

But, by a poor man's hopes in Heav'n!

While recollection's pow'r is giv'n-

If, in the vale of humble life,

The victim sad of fortune's strife,

I, thro' the tender-gushing tear,

Should recognise my master dear;

If friendless, low, we meet together,

Then, sir, your hand-my Friend and Brother!



Versified Note To Dr. Mackenzie, Mauchline



Friday first's the day appointed

By the Right Worshipful anointed,



To hold our grand procession;

To get a blad o' Johnie's morals,

And taste a swatch o' Manson's barrels



I' the way of our profession.

The Master and the Brotherhood

Would a' be glad to see you;

For me I would be mair than proud



To share the mercies wi' you.

If Death, then, wi' skaith, then,

Some mortal heart is hechtin,

Inform him, and storm him,

That Saturday you'll fecht him.

Adieu! a heart-warm fond adieu;

Dear brothers of the mystic tie!

Ye favoured, enlighten'd few,

Companions of my social joy;

Tho' I to foreign lands must hie,

Pursuing Fortune's slidd'ry ba';

With melting heart, and brimful eye,

I'll mind you still, tho' far awa.



Oft have I met your social band,

And spent the cheerful, festive night;

Oft, honour'd with supreme command,

Presided o'er the sons of light:

And by that hieroglyphic bright,

Which none but Craftsmen ever saw

Strong Mem'ry on my heart shall write

Those happy scenes, when far awa.



May Freedom, Harmony, and Love,

Unite you in the grand Design,

Beneath th' Omniscient Eye above,

The glorious Architect Divine,

That you may keep th' unerring line,

Still rising by the plummet's law,

Till Order bright completely shine,

Shall be my pray'r when far awa.



And you, farewell! whose merits claim

Justly that highest badge to wear:

Heav'n bless your honour'd noble name,

To Masonry and Scotia dear!

A last request permit me here, -

When yearly ye assemble a',

One round, I ask it with a tear,

To him, the Bard that's far awa.



On A Scotch Bard, Gone To The West Indies



A' ye wha live by sowps o' drink,

A' ye wha live by crambo-clink,

A' ye wha live and never think,

Come, mourn wi' me!

Our billie 's gien us a' a jink,

An' owre the sea!



Lament him a' ye rantin core,

Wha dearly like a random splore;

Nae mair he'll join the merry roar;

In social key;

For now he's taen anither shore.

An' owre the sea!



The bonie lasses weel may wiss him,

And in their dear petitions place him:

The widows, wives, an' a' may bless him

Wi' tearfu' e'e;

For weel I wat they'll sairly miss him

That's owre the sea!



O Fortune, they hae room to grumble!

Hadst thou taen aff some drowsy bummle,

Wha can do nought but fyke an' fumble,

'Twad been nae plea;

But he was gleg as ony wumble,

That's owre the sea!



Auld, cantie Kyle may weepers wear,

An' stain them wi' the saut, saut tear;

'Twill mak her poor auld heart, I fear,

He was her Laureat mony a year,

That's owre the sea!



He saw Misfortune's cauld nor-west

Lang mustering up a bitter blast;

A jillet brak his heart at last,

Ill may she be!

So, took a berth afore the mast,

An' owre the sea.



To tremble under Fortune's cummock,

On a scarce a bellyfu' o' drummock,

Wi' his proud, independent stomach,

Could ill agree;

So, row't his hurdies in a hammock,

An' owre the sea.



He ne'er was gien to great misguidin,

Yet coin his pouches wad na bide in;

Wi' him it ne'er was under hiding;

He dealt it free:

The Muse was a' that he took pride in,

That's owre the sea.



Jamaica bodies, use him weel,

An' hap him in cozie biel:

Ye'll find him aye a dainty chiel,

An' fou o' glee:

He wad na wrang'd the vera deil,

That's owre the sea.



Farewell, my rhyme-composing billie!

A boundless ocean's roar:

But boundless oceans, roaring wide,

Between my love and me,

They never, never can divide

My heart and soul from thee.



Farewell, farewell, Eliza dear,

The maid that I adore!

A boding voice is in mine ear,

We part to meet no more!

But the latest throb that leaves my heart,

While Death stands victor by, -

That throb, Eliza, is thy part,

And thine that latest sigh!



A Bard's Epitaph



Is there a whim-inspired fool,

Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule,

Owre blate to seek, owre proud to snool,

Let him draw near;

And owre this grassy heap sing dool,

And drap a tear.



Is there a bard of rustic song,

Who, noteless, steals the crowds among,

That weekly this area throng,

O, pass not by!

But, with a frater-feeling strong,

Here, heave a sigh.



Is there a man, whose judgment clear

Can others teach the course to steer,

Yet runs, himself, life's mad career,

Wild as the wave,

Here pause-and, thro' the starting tear,

Survey this grave.



The poor inhabitant below

Was quick to learn the wise to know,

And keenly felt the friendly glow,

And softer flame;

But thoughtless follies laid him low,

And stain'd his name!



Reader, attend! whether thy soul

Soars fancy's flights beyond the pole,

Or darkling grubs this earthly hole,

In low pursuit:

Know, prudent, cautious, self-control

Is wisdom's root.

The Lass O' Ballochmyle



     tune-"Ettrick Banks."



'Twas even-the dewy fields were green,

On every blade the pearls hang;

The zephyr wanton'd round the bean,

And bore its fragrant sweets alang:

In ev'ry glen the mavis sang,

All nature list'ning seem'd the while,

Except where greenwood echoes rang,

Amang the braes o' Ballochmyle.



With careless step I onward stray'd,

My heart rejoic'd in nature's joy,

When, musing in a lonely glade,

A maiden fair I chanc'd to spy:

Her look was like the morning's eye,

Her air like nature's vernal smile:

Perfection whisper'd, passing by,

"Behold the lass o' Ballochmyle!"



Fair is the morn in flowery May,

And sweet is night in autumn mild;

When roving thro' the garden gay,

Or wand'ring in the lonely wild:

But woman, nature's darling child!

There all her charms she does compile;

Even there her other works are foil'd

By the bonie lass o' Ballochmyle.



O, had she been a country maid,

And I the happy country swain,

Tho' shelter'd in the lowest shed

That ever rose on Scotland's plain!

Thro' weary winter's wind and rain,

With joy, with rapture, I would toil;

And nightly to my bosom strain

The bonie lass o' Ballochmyle.



Then pride might climb the slipp'ry steep,

Where frame and honours lofty shine;

And thirst of gold might tempt the deep,

Or downward seek the Indian mine:

Give me the cot below the pine,

To tend the flocks or till the soil;

And ev'ry day have joys divine

With the bonie lass o' Ballochmyle.



Lines To An Old Sweetheart



Once fondly lov'd, and still remember'd dear,

Sweet early object of my youthful vows,

Accept this mark of friendship, warm, sincere,

Friendship! 'tis all cold duty now allows.

And when you read the simple artless rhymes,

One friendly sigh for him-he asks no more,

Who, distant, burns in flaming torrid climes,

Or haply lies beneath th' Atlantic roar.



Motto Prefixed To The Author's First Publication



The simple Bard, unbroke by rules of art,

He pours the wild effusions of the heart;

And if inspir'd 'tis Nature's pow'rs inspire;

Her's all the melting thrill, and her's the kindling fire.



Lines To Mr. John Kennedy



Farewell, dear friend! may guid luck hit you,

And 'mang her favourites admit you:

If e'er Detraction shore to smit you,

May nane believe him,

And ony deil that thinks to get you,

Good Lord, deceive him!



Lines Written On A Banknote



Wae worth thy power, thou cursed leaf!

Fell source o' a' my woe and grief!

For lack o' thee I've lost my lass!

For lack o' thee I scrimp my glass!

I see the children of affliction

Unaided, through thy curst restriction:

I've seen the oppressor's cruel smile

Amid his hapless victim's spoil;

And for thy potence vainly wished,

To crush the villain in the dust:

For lack o' thee, I leave this much-lov'd shore,

Never, perhaps, to greet old Scotland more.

Stanzas On Naething



     Extempore Epistle to Gavin Hamilton, Esq.



To you, sir, this summons I've sent,

Pray, whip till the pownie is freathing;

But if you demand what I want,

I honestly answer you-naething.



Ne'er scorn a poor Poet like me,

For idly just living and breathing,

While people of every degree

Are busy employed about-naething.



Poor Centum-per-centum may fast,

And grumble his hurdies their claithing,

He'll find, when the balance is cast,

He's gane to the devil for-naething.



The courtier cringes and bows,

Ambition has likewise its plaything;

A coronet beams on his brows;

And what is a coronet-naething.



Some quarrel the Presbyter gown,

Some quarrel Episcopal graithing;

But every good fellow will own

Their quarrel is a' about-naething.



The lover may sparkle and glow,

Approaching his bonie bit gay thing:

But marriage will soon let him know

He's gotten-a buskit up naething.



The Poet may jingle and rhyme,

In hopes of a laureate wreathing,

And when he has wasted his time,

He's kindly rewarded wi'-naething.



The thundering bully may rage,

And swagger and swear like a heathen;

But collar him fast, I'll engage,

You'll find that his courage is-naething.



Last night wi' a feminine whig-

A Poet she couldna put faith in;

But soon we grew lovingly big,

I taught her, her terrors were naething.



Her whigship was wonderful pleased,

But charmingly tickled wi' ae thing,

Her fingers I lovingly squeezed,

And kissed her, and promised her-naething.



The priest anathemas may threat-

Predicament, sir, that we're baith in;

But when honour's reveille is beat,

The holy artillery's naething.



And now I must mount on the wave-

My voyage perhaps there is death in;

But what is a watery grave?

The drowning a Poet is naething.



And now, as grim death's in my thought,

To you, sir, I make this bequeathing;

My service as long as ye've ought,

And my friendship, by God, when ye've naething.



The Farewell



The valiant, in himself, what can he suffer?

Or what does he regard his single woes?

But when, alas! he multiplies himself,

To dearer serves, to the lov'd tender fair,

To those whose bliss, whose beings hang upon him,

To helpless children,-then, Oh then, he feels

The point of misery festering in his heart,

And weakly weeps his fortunes like a coward:

Such, such am I!-undone!

Farewell, old Scotia's bleak domains,

Far dearer than the torrid plains,

Where rich ananas blow!

Farewell, a mother's blessing dear!

A borther's sigh! a sister's tear!

My Jean's heart-rending throe!

Farewell, my Bess! tho' thou'rt bereft

Of my paternal care.

A faithful brother I have left,

My part in him thou'lt share!

Adieu, too, to you too,

My Smith, my bosom frien';

When kindly you mind me,

O then befriend my Jean!



What bursting anguish tears my heart;

From thee, my Jeany, must I part!

Thou, weeping, answ'rest-"No!"

Alas! misfortune stares my face,

And points to ruin and disgrace,

I for thy sake must go!

Thee, Hamilton, and Aiken dear,

A grateful, warm adieu:

I, with a much-indebted tear,

Shall still remember you!

All hail then, the gale then,

Wafts me from thee, dear shore!

It rustles, and whistles

I'll never see thee more!



The Calf



     To the Rev. James Steven, on his text, Malachi, ch. iv. vers. 2. "And ye

shall go forth, and grow up, as Calves of the stall."



Right, sir! your text I'll prove it true,

Tho' heretics may laugh;

For instance, there's yourself just now,

God knows, an unco calf.



And should some patron be so kind,

As bless you wi' a kirk,

I doubt na, sir but then we'll find,

Ye're still as great a stirk.



But, if the lover's raptur'd hour,

Shall ever be your lot,

Forbid it, ev'ry heavenly Power,

You e'er should be a stot!



Tho' when some kind connubial dear

Your but-and-ben adorns,

The like has been that you may wear

A noble head of horns.



And, in your lug, most reverend James,

To hear you roar and rowt,

Few men o' sense will doubt your claims

To rank amang the nowt.



And when ye're number'd wi' the dead,

Below a grassy hillock,

With justice they may mark your head-

"Here lies a famous bullock!"



Nature's Law-A Poem



     Humbly inscribed to Gavin Hamilton, Esq.



     Great Nature spoke: observant man obey'd-Pope.



Let other heroes boast their scars,

The marks of sturt and strife:

And other poets sing of wars,

The plagues of human life:



Shame fa' the fun, wi' sword and gun

To slap mankind like lumber!

I sing his name, and nobler fame,

Wha multiplies our number.



Great Nature spoke, with air benign,

"Go on, ye human race;

This lower world I you resign;

Be fruitful and increase.

The liquid fire of strong desire

I've pour'd it in each bosom;

Here, on this had, does Mankind stand,

And there is Beauty's blossom."



The Hero of these artless strains,

A lowly bard was he,

Who sung his rhymes in Coila's plains,

With meikle mirth an'glee;

Kind Nature's care had given his share

Large, of the flaming current;

And, all devout, he never sought

To stem the sacred torrent.



He felt the powerful, high behest

Thrill, vital, thro' and thro';

And sought a correspondent breast,

To give obedience due:

Propitious Powers screen'd the young flow'rs,

From mildews of abortion;

And low! the bard - a great reward -

Has got a double portion!



Auld cantie Coil may count the day,

As annual it returns,

The third of Libra's equal sway,

That gave another Burns,

With future rhymes, an' other times,

To emulate his sire:

To sing auld Coil in nobler style

With more poetic fire.



Ye Powers of peace, and peaceful song,

Look down with gracious eyes;

And bless auld Coila, large and long,

With multiplying joys;

Lang may she stand to prop the land,

The flow'r of ancient nations;

And Burnses spring, her fame to sing,

To endless generations!



song-Willie Chalmers



     Mr. Chalmers, a gentleman in Ayrshire, a particular friend of mine, asked

me to write a poetic epistle to a young lady, his Dulcinea. I had seen her,

but was scarcely acquainted with her, and wrote as follows:-



Wi' braw new branks in mickle pride,

And eke a braw new brechan,

My Pegasus I'm got astride,

And up Parnassus pechin;

Whiles owre a bush wi' donwward crush,

The doited beastie stammers;

Then up he gets, and off he sets,

For sake o' Willie Chalmers.



I doubt na, lass, that weel ken'd name

May cost a pair o' blushes;

I am nae stranger to your fame,

Nor his warm urged wishes.

Your bonie face sae mild and sweet,

His honest heart enamours,

And faith ye'll no be lost a whit,

Tho' wair'd on Willie Chalmers.



Auld Truth hersel' might swear yer'e fair,

And Honour safely back her;

And Modesty assume your air,

And ne'er a ane mistak her:

And sic twa love-inspiring een

Might fire even holy palmers;

Nae wonder then they've fatal been

To honest Willie Chalmers.



I doubt na fortune may you shore

Some mim-mou'd pouther'd priestie,

Fu' lifted up wi' Hebrew lore,

And band upon his breastie:

But oh! what signifies to you

His lexicons and grammars;

The feeling heart's the royal blue,

And that's wi' Willie Chalmers.



Some gapin', glowrin' countra laird

May warsle for your favour;

May claw his lug, and straik his beard,

And hoast up some palaver:

My bonie maid, before ye wed

Sic clumsy-witted hammers,

Seek Heaven for help, and barefit skelp

Awa wi' Willie Chalmers.



Forgive the Bard! my fond regard

For ane that shares my bosom,

Inspires my Muse to gie 'm his dues

For deil a hair I roose him.

May powers aboon unite you soon,

And fructify your amours, -

And every year come in mair dear

To you and Willie Chalmers.



Reply To A Trimming Epistle Received From A Tailor



What ails ye now, ye lousie bitch

To thresh my back at sic a pitch?

Losh, man! hae mercy wi' your natch,

Your bodkin's bauld;

I didna suffer half sae much

Frae Daddie Auld.



What tho' at times, when I grow crouse,

I gie their wames a random pouse,

Is that enough for you to souse

Your servant sae?

Gae mind your seam, ye prick-the-louse,

An' jag-the-flea!



King David, o' poetic brief,

Wrocht 'mang the lasses sic mischief

As filled his after-life wi' grief,

An' bluidy rants,

An' yet he's rank'd amang the chief

O' lang-syne saunts.



And maybe, Tam, for a' my cants,

My wicked rhymes, an' drucken rants,

I'll gie auld cloven's Clootie's haunts

An unco slip yet,

An' snugly sit amang the saunts,

At Davie's hip yet!



But, fegs! the session says I maun

Gae fa' upo' anither plan

Than garrin lasses coup the cran,

Clean heels ower body,

An' sairly thole their mother's ban

Afore the howdy.



This leads me on to tell for sport,

How I did wi' the Session sort;

Auld Clinkum, at the inner port,

Cried three times, "Robin!

Come hither lad, and answer for't,

Ye're blam'd for jobbin!"



Wi' pinch I put a Sunday's face on,

An' snoov'd awa before the Session:

I made an open, fair confession-

I scorn't to lee,

An' syne Mess John, beyond expression,

Fell foul o' me.



A fornicator-loun he call'd me,

An' said my faut frae bliss expell'd me;

I own'd the tale was true he tell'd me,

"But, what the matter?

(Quo' I) I fear unless ye geld me,

I'll ne'er be better!"



"Geld you! (quo' he) an' what for no?

If that your right hand, leg or toe

Should ever prove your sp'ritual foe,

You should remember

To cut it aff-an' what for no

Your dearest member?"



"Na, na, (quo' I,) I'm no for that,

Gelding's nae better than 'tis ca't;

I'd rather suffer for my faut

A hearty flewit,

As sair owre hip as ye can draw't,

Tho' I should rue it.



"Or, gin ye like to end the bother,

To please us a'-I've just ae ither-

When next wi' yon lass I forgather,

Whate'er betide it,

I'll frankly gie her 't a' thegither,

An' let her guide it."



But, sir, this pleas'd them warst of a',

An' therefore, Tam, when that I saw,

I said "Gude night," an' cam' awa',

An' left the Session;

I saw they were resolved a'

The Brigs Of Ayr



A Poem



     Inscribed to John Ballantine, Esq., Ayr.



The simple Bard, rough at the rustic plough,

Learning his tuneful trade from ev'ry bough;

The chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush,

Hailing the setting sun, sweet, in the green thorn bush;

The soaring lark, the perching red-breast shrill,

Or deep-ton'd plovers grey, wild-whistling o'er the hill;

Shall he-nurst in the peasant's lowly shed,

To hardy independence bravely bred,

By early poverty to hardship steel'd.

And train'd to arms in stern Misfortune's field-

Shall he be guilty of their hireling crimes,

The servile, mercenary Swiss of rhymes?

Or labour hard the panegyric close,

With all the venal soul of dedicating prose?

No! though his artless strains he rudely sings,

And throws his hand uncouthly o'er the strings,

He glows with all the spirit of the Bard,

Fame, honest fame, his great, his dear reward.

Still, if some patron's gen'rous care he trace,

Skill'd in the secret, to bestow with grace;

When Ballantine befriends his humble name,

And hands the rustic stranger up to fame,

With heartfelt throes his grateful bosom swells,

The godlike bliss, to give, alone excels.



'Twas when the stacks get on their winter hap,

And thack and rape secure the toil-won crap;

Potatoe-bings are snugged up frae skaith

O' coming Winter's biting, frosty breath;

The bees, rejoicing o'er their summer toils,

Unnumber'd buds an' flow'rs' delicious spoils,

Seal'd up with frugal care in massive waxen piles,

Are doom'd by Man, that tyrant o'er the weak,

The death o' devils, smoor'd wi' brimstone reek:

The thundering guns are heard on ev'ry side,

The wounded coveys, reeling, scatter wide;

The feather'd field-mates, bound by Nature's tie,

Sires, mothers, children, in one carnage lie:

(What warm, poetic heart but inly bleeds,

And execrates man's savage, ruthless deeds!)

Nae mair the flow'r in field or meadow springs,

Nae mair the grove with airy concert rings,

Except perhaps the Robin's whistling glee,

Proud o' the height o' some bit half-lang tree:

The hoary morns precede the sunny days,

Mild, calm, serene, wide spreads the noontide blaze,

While thick the gosamour waves wanton in the rays.



'Twas in that season, when a simple Bard,

Unknown and poor-simplicity's reward!-

Ae night, within the ancient brugh of Ayr,

By whim inspir'd, or haply prest wi' care,

He left his bed, and took his wayward route,

And down by Simpson's^1 wheel'd the left about:

(Whether impell'd by all-directing Fate,

To witness what I after shall narrate;

Or whether, rapt in meditation high,

He wander'd out, he knew not where or why:)

The drowsy Dungeon-clock^2 had number'd two,

and Wallace Tower^2 had sworn the fact was true:

The tide-swoln firth, with sullen-sounding roar,

Through the still night dash'd hoarse along the shore.

All else was hush'd as Nature's closed e'e;

The silent moon shone high o'er tower and tree;

The chilly frost, beneath the silver beam,

Crept, gently-crusting, o'er the glittering stream-

When, lo! on either hand the list'ning Bard,

The clanging sugh of whistling wings is heard;

Two dusky forms dart through the midnight air;

Swift as the gos^3 drives on the wheeling hare;

Ane on th' Auld Brig his airy shape uprears,

The other flutters o'er the rising piers:

Our warlock Rhymer instantly dexcried

The Sprites that owre the Brigs of Ayr preside.

(That Bards are second-sighted is nae joke,

And ken the lingo of the sp'ritual folk;

Fays, Spunkies, Kelpies, a', they can explain them,

And even the very deils they brawly ken them).

Auld Brig appear'd of ancient Pictish race,

The very wrinkles Gothic in his face;

He seem'd as he wi' Time had warstl'd lang,

Yet, teughly doure, he bade an unco bang.

New Brig was buskit in a braw new coat,

That he, at Lon'on, frae ane Adams got;

In 's hand five taper staves as smooth 's a bead,

Wi' virls and whirlygigums at the head.

The Goth was stalking round with anxious search,

Spying the time-worn flaws in every arch;

It chanc'd his new-come neibor took his e'e,

And e'en a vexed and angry heart had he!

Wi' thieveless sneer to see his modish mien,

He, down the water, gies him this guid-e'en:-



Auld Brig



"I doubt na, frien', ye'll think ye're nae sheepshank,

Ance ye were streekit owre frae bank to bank!

But gin ye be a brig as auld as me-

Tho' faith, that date, I doubt, ye'll never see-

There'll be, if that day come, I'll wad a boddle,

Some fewer whigmaleeries in your noddle."



New Brig



"Auld Vandal! ye but show your little mense,

Just much about it wi' your scanty sense:

Will your poor, narrow foot-path of a street,

Where twa wheel-barrows tremble when they meet,

Your ruin'd, formless bulk o' stane and lime,

Compare wi' bonie brigs o' modern time?

There's men of taste wou'd tak the Ducat stream,^4

Tho' they should cast the very sark and swim,

E'er they would grate their feelings wi' the view

O' sic an ugly, Gothic hulk as you."



Auld Brig



"Conceited gowk! puff'd up wi' windy pride!

This mony a year I've stood the flood an' tide;

And tho' wi' crazy eild I'm sair forfairn,

I'll be a brig when ye're a shapeless cairn!

As yet ye little ken about the matter,

But twa-three winters will inform ye better.

When heavy, dark, continued, a'-day rains,



[Footnote 4: A noted ford, just above the Auld Brig.-R. B.]



Wi' deepening deluges o'erflow the plains;

When from the hills where springs the brawling Coil,

Or stately Lugar's mossy fountains boil;

Or where the Greenock winds his moorland course.

Or haunted Garpal draws his feeble source,

Aroused by blustering winds an' spotting thowes,

In mony a torrent down the snaw-broo rowes;

While crashing ice, borne on the rolling spate,

Sweeps dams, an' mills, an' brigs, a' to the gate;

And from Glenbuck,^5 down to the Ratton-key,^6

Auld Ayr is just one lengthen'd, tumbling sea-

Then down ye'll hurl, (deil nor ye never rise!)

And dash the gumlie jaups up to the pouring skies!

A lesson sadly teaching, to your cost,

That Architecture's noble art is lost!"



New Brig



"Fine architecture, trowth, I needs must say't o't,

The Lord be thankit that we've tint the gate o't!

Gaunt, ghastly, ghaist-alluring edifices,

Hanging with threat'ning jut, like precipices;

O'er-arching, mouldy, gloom-inspiring coves,

Supporting roofs, fantastic, stony groves;

Windows and doors in nameless sculptures drest

With order, symmetry, or taste unblest;

Forms like some bedlam Statuary's dream,

The craz'd creations of misguided whim;

Forms might be worshipp'd on the bended knee,

And still the second dread command be free;

Their likeness is not found on earth, in air, or sea!

Mansions that would disgrace the building taste

Of any mason reptile, bird or beast:

Fit only for a doited monkish race,

Or frosty maids forsworn the dear embrace,

Or cuifs of later times, wha held the notion,

That sullen gloom was sterling, true devotion:

Fancies that our guid Brugh denies protection,

And soon may they expire, unblest wi' resurrection!"

"O ye, my dear-remember'd, ancient yealings,

Were ye but here to share my wounded feelings!

Ye worthy Proveses, an' mony a Bailie,

Wha in the paths o' righteousness did toil aye;

Ye dainty Deacons, and ye douce Conveners,

To whom our moderns are but causey-cleaners

Ye godly Councils, wha hae blest this town;

ye godly Brethren o' the sacred gown,

Wha meekly gie your hurdies to the smiters;

And (what would now be strange), ye godly Writers;

A' ye douce folk I've borne aboon the broo,

Were ye but here, what would ye say or do?

How would your spirits groan in deep vexation,

To see each melancholy alteration;

And, agonising, curse the time and place

When ye begat the base degen'rate race!

Nae langer rev'rend men, their country's glory,

In plain braid Scots hold forth a plain braid story;

Nae langer thrifty citizens, an' douce,

But staumrel, corky-headed, graceless Gentry,

Men, three-parts made by tailors and by barbers,

Wha waste your weel-hain'd gear on damn'd new brigs and harbours!"



New Brig



"Now haud you there! for faith ye've said enough,

And muckle mair than ye can mak to through.

As for your Priesthood, I shall say but little,

Corbies and Clergy are a shot right kittle:

But, under favour o' your langer beard,

Abuse o' Magistrates might weel be spar'd;

To liken them to your auld-warld squad,

I must needs say, comparisons are odd.

In Ayr, wag-wits nae mair can hae a handle

To mouth 'a Citizen,' a term o' scandal;

Nae mair the Council waddles down the street,

In all the pomp of ignorant conceit;

Men wha grew wise priggin owre hops and raisins,

Or gather'd lib'ral views in Bonds and Seisins:

If haply Knowledge, on a random tramp,

Had shor'd them with a glimmer of his lamp,

And would to Common-sense for once betray'd them,

Plain, dull Stupidity stept kindly in to aid them."



What farther clish-ma-claver aight been said,

What bloody wars, if Sprites had blood to shed,

No man can tell; but, all before their sight,

A fairy train appear'd in order bright;

Adown the glittering stream they featly danc'd;

Bright to the moon their various dresses glanc'd:

They footed o'er the wat'ry glass so neat,

The infant ice scarce bent beneath their feet:

While arts of Minstrelsy among them rung,

And soul-ennobling Bards heroic ditties sung.



O had M'Lauchlan,^7 thairm-inspiring sage,

Been there to hear this heavenly band engage,

When thro' his dear strathspeys they bore with Highland rage;

Or when they struck old Scotia's melting airs,

The lover's raptured joys or bleeding cares;

How would his Highland lug been nobler fir'd,

And ev'n his matchless hand with finer touch inspir'd!

No guess could tell what instrument appear'd,

But all the soul of Music's self was heard;

Harmonious concert rung in every part,

While simple melody pour'd moving on the heart.

The Genius of the Stream in front appears,

A venerable Chief advanc'd in years;

His hoary head with water-lilies crown'd,

His manly leg with garter-tangle bound.

Next came the loveliest pair in all the ring,

Sweet female Beauty hand in hand with Spring;

Then, crown'd with flow'ry hay, came Rural Joy,

And Summer, with his fervid-beaming eye;



[Footnote 7: A well-known performer of Scottish music on the violin.-R. B.]



All-cheering Plenty, with her flowing horn,

Led yellow Autumn wreath'd with nodding corn;

Then Winter's time-bleach'd locks did hoary show,

By Hospitality with cloudless brow:

Next followed Courage with his martial stride,

From where the Feal wild-woody coverts hide;^8

Benevolence, with mild, benignant air,

A female form, came from the tow'rs of Stair;^9

Learning and Worth in equal measures trode,

From simple Catrine, their long-lov'd abode:^10

Last, white-rob'd Peace, crown'd with a hazel wreath,

To rustic Agriculture did bequeath

The broken, iron instruments of death:

At sight of whom our Sprites forgat their kindling wrath.



Fragment Of Song



The night was still, and o'er the hill

The moon shone on the castle wa';

The mavis sang, while dew-drops hang

Around her on the castle wa';

Sae merrily they danced the ring

Frae eenin' till the cock did craw;

And aye the o'erword o' the spring

Was "Irvine's bairns are bonie a'."



Epigram On Rough Roads



I'm now arrived-thanks to the gods!-

Thro' pathways rough and muddy,

A certain sign that makin roads

Is no this people's study:

Altho' Im not wi' Scripture cram'd,

I'm sure the Bible says

That heedless sinners shall be damn'd,

Unless they mend their ways.

Prayer-O Thou Dread Power



     Lying at a reverend friend's house one night, the author left the

following verses in the room where he slept:-



O Thou dread Power, who reign'st above,

I know thou wilt me hear,

When for this scene of peace and love,

I make this prayer sincere.



The hoary Sire-the mortal stroke,

Long, long be pleas'd to spare;

To bless this little filial flock,

And show what good men are.



She, who her lovely offspring eyes

With tender hopes and fears,

O bless her with a mother's joys,

But spare a mother's tears!



Their hope, their stay, their darling youth.

In manhood's dawning blush,

Bless him, Thou God of love and truth,

Up to a parent's wish.



The beauteous, seraph sister-band-

With earnest tears I pray-

Thou know'st the snares on ev'ry hand,

Guide Thou their steps alway.



When, soon or late, they reach that coast,

O'er Life's rough ocean driven,

May they rejoice, no wand'rer lost,

A family in Heaven!



Farewell Song To The Banks Of Ayr



     tune-"Roslin Castle."



     "I composed this song as I conveyed my chest so far on my road to

Greenock, where I was to embark in a few days for Jamaica. I meant it as my

farewell dirge to my native land."-R. B.



The gloomy night is gath'ring fast,

Loud roars the wild, inconstant blast,

Yon murky cloud is foul with rain,

I see it driving o'er the plain;

The hunter now has left the moor.

The scatt'red coveys meet secure;

While here I wander, prest with care,

Along the lonely banks of Ayr.



The Autumn mourns her rip'ning corn

By early Winter's ravage torn;

Across her placid, azure sky,

She sees the scowling tempest fly:

Chill runs my blood to hear it rave;

I think upon the stormy wave,

Where many a danger I must dare,

Far from the bonie banks of Ayr.



'Tis not the surging billow's roar,

'Tis not that fatal, deadly shore;

Tho' death in ev'ry shape appear,

The wretched have no more to fear:

But round my heart the ties are bound,

That heart transpierc'd with many a wound;

These bleed afresh, those ties I tear,

To leave the bonie banks of Ayr.



Farewell, old Coila's hills and dales,

Her healthy moors and winding vales;

The scenes where wretched Fancy roves,

Pursuing past, unhappy loves!

Farewell, my friends! farewell, my foes!

My peace with these, my love with those:

The bursting tears my heart declare-

Farewell, the bonie banks of Ayr!



Address To The Toothache



My curse upon your venom'd stang,

That shoots my tortur'd gums alang,

An' thro' my lug gies mony a twang,

Wi' gnawing vengeance,

Tearing my nerves wi' bitter pang,

Like racking engines!



When fevers burn, or argues freezes,

Rheumatics gnaw, or colics squeezes,

Our neibor's sympathy can ease us,

Wi' pitying moan;

But thee-thou hell o' a' diseases-

Aye mocks our groan.



Adown my beard the slavers trickle

I throw the wee stools o'er the mickle,

While round the fire the giglets keckle,

To see me loup,

While, raving mad, I wish a heckle

Were in their doup!



In a' the numerous human dools,

Ill hairsts, daft bargains, cutty stools,

Or worthy frien's rak'd i' the mools, -

Sad sight to see!

The tricks o' knaves, or fash o'fools,

Thou bear'st the gree!



Where'er that place be priests ca' hell,

Where a' the tones o' misery yell,

An' ranked plagues their numbers tell,

In dreadfu' raw,

Thou, Toothache, surely bear'st the bell,

Amang them a'!



O thou grim, mischief-making chiel,

That gars the notes o' discord squeel,

Till daft mankind aft dance a reel

In gore, a shoe-thick,

Gie a' the faes o' Scotland's weal

A townmond's toothache!



Lines On Meeting With Lord Daer^1



This wot ye all whom it concerns,

I, Rhymer Robin, alias Burns,

October twenty-third,



[Footnote 1: At the house of Professor Dugald Stewart.]



A ne'er-to-be-forgotten day,

Sae far I sprackl'd up the brae,

I dinner'd wi' a Lord.



I've been at drucken writers' feasts,

Nay, been bitch-fou 'mang godly priests-

Wi' rev'rence be it spoken!-

I've even join'd the honour'd jorum,

When mighty Squireships of the quorum,

Their hydra drouth did sloken.



But wi' a Lord!-stand out my shin,

A Lord-a Peer-an Earl's son!

Up higher yet, my bonnet

An' sic a Lord!-lang Scoth ells twa,

Our Peerage he o'erlooks them a',

As I look o'er my sonnet.



But O for Hogarth's magic pow'r!

To show Sir Bardie's willyart glow'r,

An' how he star'd and stammer'd,

When, goavin, as if led wi' branks,

An' stumpin on his ploughman shanks,

He in the parlour hammer'd.



I sidying shelter'd in a nook,

An' at his Lordship steal't a look,

Like some portentous omen;

Except good sense and social glee,

An' (what surpris'd me) modesty,

I marked nought uncommon.



I watch'd the symptoms o' the Great,

The gentle pride, the lordly state,

The arrogant assuming;

The fient a pride, nae pride had he,

Nor sauce, nor state, that I could see,

Mair than an honest ploughman.



Then from his Lordship I shall learn,

Henceforth to meet with unconcern

One rank as weel's another;

Nae honest, worthy man need care

To meet with noble youthful Daer,

For he but meets a brother.





Masonic Song

Ye sons of old Killie, assembled by Willie,

To follow the noble vocation;

Your thrifty old mother has scarce such another

To sit in that honoured station.

I've little to say, but only to pray,

As praying's the ton of your fashion;

A prayer from thee Muse you well may excuse

'Tis seldom her favourite passion.



Ye powers who preside o'er the wind, and the tide,

Who marked each element's border;

Who formed this frame with beneficent aim,

Whose sovereign statute is order:-

Within this dear mansion, may wayward Contention

Or withered Envy ne'er enter;

May secrecy round be the mystical bound,

And brotherly Love be the centre!



Tam Samson's Elegy



     An honest man's the noblest work of God-Pope.



     When this worthy old sportman went out, last muirfowl season, he

supposed it was to be, in Ossian's phrase, "the last of his fields," and

expressed an ardent wish to die and be buried in the muirs. On this hint the

author composed his elegy and epitaph.-R.B., 1787.



Has auld Kilmarnock seen the deil?

Or great Mackinlay^1 thrawn his heel?

Or Robertson^2 again grown weel,

To preach an' read?

"Na' waur than a'! cries ilka chiel,

"Tam Samson's dead!"



[Footnote 1: A certain preacher, a great favourite with the million. Vide "The

Ordination." stanza ii.-R. B.]



[Footnote 2: Another preacher, an equal favourite with the few, who was at

that time ailing. For him see also "The Ordination," stanza ix.-R.B.]



Kilmarnock lang may grunt an' grane,

An' sigh, an' sab, an' greet her lane,

An' cleed her bairns, man, wife, an' wean,

In mourning weed;

To Death she's dearly pay'd the kane-

Tam Samson's dead!



The Brethren, o' the mystic level

May hing their head in woefu' bevel,

While by their nose the tears will revel,

Like ony bead;

Death's gien the Lodge an unco devel;

Tam Samson's dead!



When Winter muffles up his cloak,

And binds the mire like a rock;

When to the loughs the curlers flock,

Wi' gleesome speed,

Wha will they station at the cock?

Tam Samson's dead!

When Winter muffles up his cloak,

He was the king o' a' the core,

To guard, or draw, or wick a bore,

Or up the rink like Jehu roar,

In time o' need;

But now he lags on Death's hog-score-

Tam Samson's dead!



Now safe the stately sawmont sail,

And trouts bedropp'd wi' crimson hail,

And eels, weel-ken'd for souple tail,

And geds for greed,

Since, dark in Death's fish-creel, we wail

Tam Samson's dead!



Rejoice, ye birring paitricks a';

Ye cootie muircocks, crousely craw;

Ye maukins, cock your fud fu' braw

Withouten dread;

Your mortal fae is now awa;

Tam Samson's dead!



That woefu' morn be ever mourn'd,

Saw him in shooting graith adorn'd,

While pointers round impatient burn'd,

Frae couples free'd;

But och! he gaed and ne'er return'd!

Tam Samson's dead!



In vain auld age his body batters,

In vain the gout his ancles fetters,

In vain the burns cam down like waters,

An acre braid!

Now ev'ry auld wife, greetin, clatters

"Tam Samson's dead!"



Owre mony a weary hag he limpit,

An' aye the tither shot he thumpit,

Till coward Death behind him jumpit,

Wi' deadly feid;

Now he proclaims wi' tout o' trumpet,

"Tam Samson's dead!"



When at his heart he felt the dagger,

He reel'd his wonted bottle-swagger,

But yet he drew the mortal trigger,

Wi' weel-aimed heed;

"Lord, five!" he cry'd, an' owre did stagger-

Tam Samson's dead!



Ilk hoary hunter mourn'd a brither;

Ilk sportsman youth bemoan'd a father;

Yon auld gray stane, amang the heather,

Marks out his head;

Whare Burns has wrote, in rhyming blether,

"Tam Samson's dead!"



There, low he lies, in lasting rest;

Perhaps upon his mould'ring breast

Some spitefu' muirfowl bigs her nest

To hatch an' breed:

Alas! nae mair he'll them molest!

Tam Samson's dead!



When August winds the heather wave,

And sportsmen wander by yon grave,

Three volleys let his memory crave,

O' pouther an' lead,

Till Echo answer frae her cave,

"Tam Samson's dead!"



Heav'n rest his saul whare'er he be!

Is th' wish o' mony mae than me:

He had twa fauts, or maybe three,

Yet what remead?

Ae social, honest man want we:

Tam Samson's dead!



The Epitaph



Tam Samson's weel-worn clay here lies

Ye canting zealots, spare him!

If honest worth in Heaven rise,

Ye'll mend or ye win near him.

Hail, thairm-inspirin', rattlin' Willie!

Tho' fortune's road be rough an' hilly

When, idly goavin', whiles we saunter,

Yirr! fancy barks, awa we canter,

Up hill, down brae, till some mischanter,

Some black bog-hole,

Arrests us; then the scathe an' banter

We're forced to thole.



Hale be your heart! hale be your fiddle!

Lang may your elbuck jink and diddle,

May still your life from day to day,

Nae "lente largo" in the play,

But "allegretto forte" gay,

Harmonious flow,

A sweeping, kindling, bauld strathspey-

Encore! Bravo!



A blessing on the cheery gang

Wha dearly like a jig or sang,

By square an' rule,

But, as the clegs o' feeling stang,

Are wise or fool.



My hand-waled curse keep hard in chase

The harpy, hoodock, purse-proud race,

Wha count on poortith as disgrace;

Their tuneless hearts,

May fireside discords jar a base

An' that there is, I've little swither

About the matter;

We, cheek for chow, shall jog thegither,

We've faults and failings-granted clearly,

We're frail backsliding mortals merely,

Fragment On Sensibility



Rusticity's ungainly form

May cloud the highest mind;

But when the heart is nobly warm,

The good excuse will find.



Propriety's cold, cautious rules

Warm fervour may o'erlook:

But spare poor sensibility

Th' ungentle, harsh rebuke.



A Winter Night



Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,

That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm!

How shall your houseless heads, and unfed sides,

Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you

From seasons such as these?-Shakespeare.



When biting Boreas, fell and dour,

Sharp shivers thro' the leafless bow'r;

When Phoebus gies a short-liv'd glow'r,

Far south the lift,

Dim-dark'ning thro' the flaky show'r,

Or whirling drift:



Ae night the storm the steeples rocked,

Poor Labour sweet in sleep was locked,

While burns, wi' snawy wreaths up-choked,

Wild-eddying swirl;

Or, thro' the mining outlet bocked,

Down headlong hurl:



List'ning the doors an' winnocks rattle,

I thought me on the ourie cattle,

Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle

O' winter war,

And thro' the drift, deep-lairing, sprattle

Beneath a scar.



Ilk happing bird,-wee, helpless thing!

That, in the merry months o' spring,

Delighted me to hear thee sing,

What comes o' thee?

Whare wilt thou cow'r thy chittering wing,

An' close thy e'e?



Ev'n you, on murdering errands toil'd,

Lone from your savage homes exil'd,

The blood-stain'd roost, and sheep-cote spoil'd

My heart forgets,

While pityless the tempest wild

Sore on you beats!



Now Phoebe in her midnight reign,

Dark-muff'd, view'd the dreary plain;

Still crowding thoughts, a pensive train,

Rose in my soul,

When on my ear this plantive strain,

Slow, solemn, stole:-



"Blow, blow, ye winds, with heavier gust!

And freeze, thou bitter-biting frost!

Descend, ye chilly, smothering snows!

Not all your rage, as now united, shows

More hard unkindness unrelenting,

Vengeful malice unrepenting.

Than heaven-illumin'd Man on brother Man bestows!



"See stern Oppression's iron grip,

Or mad Ambition's gory hand,

Sending, like blood-hounds from the slip,

Woe, Want, and Murder o'er a land!

Ev'n in the peaceful rural vale,

Truth, weeping, tells the mournful tale,

How pamper'd Luxury, Flatt'ry by her side,

The parasite empoisoning her ear,

With all the servile wretches in the rear,

Looks o'er proud Property, extended wide;

And eyes the simple, rustic hind,

Whose toil upholds the glitt'ring show-

A creature of another kind,

Some coarser substance, unrefin'd-

Plac'd for her lordly use thus far, thus vile, below!



"Where, where is Love's fond, tender throe,

With lordly Honour's lofty brow,

The pow'rs you proudly own?

Is there, beneath Love's noble name,

Can harbour, dark, the selfish aim,

To bless himself alone?

Mark maiden-innocence a prey

To love-pretending snares:

This boasted Honour turns away,

Shunning soft Pity's rising sway,

Regardless of the tears and unavailing pray'rs!

Perhaps this hour, in Misery's squalid nest,

She strains your infant to her joyless breast,

And with a mother's fears shrinks at the rocking blast!



"Oh ye! who, sunk in beds of down,

Feel not a want but what yourselves create,

Think, for a moment, on his wretched fate,

Whom friends and fortune quite disown!

Ill-satisfy'd keen nature's clamorous call,

Stretch'd on his straw, he lays himself to sleep;

While through the ragged roof and chinky wall,

Chill, o'er his slumbers, piles the drifty heap!

Think on the dungeon's grim confine,

Where Guilt and poor Misfortune pine!

Guilt, erring man, relenting view,

But shall thy legal rage pursue

The wretch, already crushed low

By cruel Fortune's undeserved blow?

Affliction's sons are brothers in distress;

A brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!"



I heard nae mair, for Chanticleer

Shook off the pouthery snaw,

And hail'd the morning with a cheer,

A cottage-rousing craw.

But deep this truth impress'd my mind-

Thro' all His works abroad,

The heart benevolent and kind

The most resembles God.



song-Yon Wild Mossy Mountains



Yon wild mossy mountains sae lofty and wide,

That nurse in their bosom the youth o' the Clyde,

Where the grouse lead their coveys thro' the heather to feed,

And the shepherd tends his flock as he pipes on his reed.



Not Gowrie's rich valley, nor Forth's sunny shores,

To me hae the charms o'yon wild, mossy moors;

For there, by a lanely, sequestered stream,

Besides a sweet lassie, my thought and my dream.



Amang thae wild mountains shall still be my path,

Ilk stream foaming down its ain green, narrow strath;

For there, wi' my lassie, the day lang I rove,

While o'er us unheeded flie the swift hours o'love.



She is not the fairest, altho' she is fair;

O' nice education but sma' is her share;

Her parentage humble as humble can be;

But I lo'e the dear lassie because she lo'es me.



To Beauty what man but maun yield him a prize,

In her armour of glances, and blushes, and sighs?

And when wit and refinement hae polish'd her darts,

They dazzle our een, as they flie to our hearts.



But kindness, sweet kindness, in the fond-sparkling e'e,

Has lustre outshining the diamond to me;

And the heart beating love as I'm clasp'd in her arms,

O, these are my lassie's all-conquering charms!



Address To Edinburgh



Edina! Scotia's darling seat!

All hail thy palaces and tow'rs,

Where once, beneath a Monarch's feet,

Sat Legislation's sov'reign pow'rs:

From marking wildly scatt'red flow'rs,

As on the banks of Ayr I stray'd,

And singing, lone, the lingering hours,

I shelter in they honour'd shade.



Here Wealth still swells the golden tide,

As busy Trade his labours plies;

There Architecture's noble pride

Bids elegance and splendour rise:

Here Justice, from her native skies,

High wields her balance and her rod;

There Learning, with his eagle eyes,

Seeks Science in her coy abode.



Thy sons, Edina, social, kind,

With open arms the stranger hail;

Their views enlarg'd, their liberal mind,

Above the narrow, rural vale:

Attentive still to Sorrow's wail,

Or modest Merit's silent claim;

And never may their sources fail!

And never Envy blot their name!



Thy daughters bright thy walks adorn,

Gay as the gilded summer sky,

Sweet as the dewy, milk-white thorn,

Dear as the raptur'd thrill of joy!

Fair Burnet strikes th' adoring eye,

Heaven's beauties on my fancy shine;

I see the Sire of Love on high,

And own His work indeed divine!



There, watching high the least alarms,

Thy rough, rude fortress gleams afar;

Like some bold veteran, grey in arms,

And mark'd with many a seamy scar:

The pond'rous wall and massy bar,

Grim-rising o'er the rugged rock,

Have oft withstood assailing war,

And oft repell'd th' invader's shock.



With awe-struck thought, and pitying tears,

I view that noble, stately Dome,

Where Scotia's kings of other years,

Fam'd heroes! had their royal home:

Alas, how chang'd the times to come!

Their royal name low in the dust!

Their hapless race wild-wand'ring roam!

Tho' rigid Law cries out 'twas just!



Wild beats my heart to trace your steps,

Whose ancestors, in days of yore,

Thro' hostile ranks and ruin'd gaps

Old Scotia's bloody lion bore:

Ev'n I who sing in rustic lore,

Haply my sires have left their shed,

And fac'd grim Danger's loudest roar,

Bold-following where your fathers led!



Edina! Scotia's darling seat!

All hail thy palaces and tow'rs;

Where once, beneath a Monarch's feet,

Sat Legislation's sovereign pow'rs:

From marking wildly-scatt'red flow'rs,

As on the banks of Ayr I stray'd,

And singing, lone, the ling'ring hours,

I shelter in thy honour'd shade.



Address To A Haggis



Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,

Great chieftain o' the pudding-race!

Aboon them a' yet tak your place,

Painch, tripe, or thairm:

Weel are ye wordy o'a grace

As lang's my arm.



The groaning trencher there ye fill,

Your hurdies like a distant hill,

Your pin was help to mend a mill

In time o'need,

While thro' your pores the dews distil

Like amber bead.



His knife see rustic Labour dight,

An' cut you up wi' ready sleight,

Trenching your gushing entrails bright,

Like ony ditch;

And then, O what a glorious sight,

Warm-reekin', rich!



Then, horn for horn, they stretch an' strive:

Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive,

Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve

Are bent like drums;

Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive,

Bethankit! hums.



Is there that owre his French ragout

Or olio that wad staw a sow,

Or fricassee wad make her spew

Wi' perfect sconner,

Looks down wi' sneering, scornfu' view

On sic a dinner?



Poor devil! see him owre his trash,

As feckles as wither'd rash,

His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash;

His nieve a nit;

Thro' blody flood or field to dash,

O how unfit!



But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed,

The trembling earth resounds his tread.

Clap in his walie nieve a blade,

He'll mak it whissle;

An' legs an' arms, an' hands will sned,

Like taps o' trissle.



Ye Pow'rs, wha mak mankind your care,

And dish them out their bill o' fare,

Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware

That jaups in luggies;

But, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer

Gie her a haggis!
