I do Confess Thou Art Sae Fair



Alteration of an Old Poem.



I Do confess thou art sae fair,

I was been o'er the lugs in luve,

Had I na found the slightest prayer

That lips could speak thy heart could muve.



I do confess thee sweet, but find

Thou art so thriftless o' thy sweets,

Thy favours are the silly wind

That kisses ilka thing it meets.



See yonder rosebud, rich in dew,

Amang its native briers sae coy;

How sune it tines its scent and hue,

When pu'd and worn a common toy.



Sic fate ere lang shall thee betide,

Tho' thou may gaily bloom awhile;

And sune thou shalt be thrown aside,

Like ony common weed and vile.



Lines On Fergusson, The Poet



Ill-fated genius! Heaven-taught Fergusson!

What heart that feels and will not yield a tear,

To think Life's sun did set e'er well begun

To shed its influence on thy bright career.



O why should truest Worth and Genius pine

Beneath the iron grasp of Want and Woe,

While titled knaves and idiot-Greatness shine

In all the splendour Fortune can bestow?



The Weary Pund O' Tow



Chorus.-The weary pund, the weary pund,

The weary pund o' tow;

I think my wife will end her life,

Before she spin her tow.



I bought my wife a stane o' lint,

As gude as e'er did grow,

And a' that she has made o' that

Is ae puir pund o' tow.

The weary pund, &c.



There sat a bottle in a bole,

Beyont the ingle low;

And aye she took the tither souk,

To drouk the stourie tow.

The weary pund, &c.



Quoth I, For shame, ye dirty dame,

Gae spin your tap o' tow!

She took the rock, and wi' a knock,

She brak it o'er my pow.

The weary pund, &c.



At last her feet-I sang to see't!

Gaed foremost o'er the knowe,

And or I wad anither jad,

I'll wallop in a tow.

The weary pund, &c.

The cat has twa the very colour;

Five rusty teeth, forbye a stump,

A clapper tongue wad deave a miller:

Her nose and chin they threaten ither;

She's bow-hough'd, she's hein-shin'd,

Ae limpin leg a hand-breed shorter;

She's twisted right, she's twisted left,

To balance fair in ilka quarter:

She has a lump upon her breast,

The twin o' that upon her shouther;

My bonie laddie's young, but he's growin' yet.



O father, O father, an ye think it fit,

We'll send him a year to the college yet,

We'll sew a green ribbon round about his hat,

And that will let them ken he's to marry yet.



Lady Mary Ann was a flower in the dew,

Sweet was its smell and bonie was its hue,

And the longer it blossom'd the sweeter it grew,

For the lily in the bud will be bonier yet.



Young Charlie Cochran was the sprout of an aik,

Bonie and bloomin' and straught was its make,

The sun took delight to shine for its sake,

And it will be the brag o' the forest yet.



The simmer is gane when the leaves they were green,

And the days are awa' that we hae seen,

But far better days I trust will come again;

For my bonie laddie's young, but he's growin' yet.



Kellyburn Braes



There lived a carl in Kellyburn Braes,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

And he had a wife was the plague of his days,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



Ae day as the carl gaed up the lang glen,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

He met with the Devil, says, "How do you fen?"

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



I've got a bad wife, sir, that's a' my complaint,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

"For, savin your presence, to her ye're a saint,"

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



It's neither your stot nor your staig I shall crave,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

"But gie me your wife, man, for her I must have,"

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



"O welcome most kindly!" the blythe carl said,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

"But if ye can match her ye're waur than ye're ca'd,"

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



The Devil has got the auld wife on his back,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

And, like a poor pedlar, he's carried his pack,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



He's carried her hame to his ain hallan door,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

Syne bade her gae in, for a bitch, and a whore,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



Then straight he makes fifty, the pick o' his band,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme:

Turn out on her guard in the clap o' a hand,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



The carlin gaed thro' them like ony wud bear,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

Whae'er she gat hands on cam near her nae mair,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



A reekit wee deevil looks over the wa',

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

"O help, maister, help, or she'll ruin us a'!"

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



The Devil he swore by the edge o' his knife,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

He pitied the man that was tied to a wife,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



The Devil he swore by the kirk and the bell,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

He was not in wedlock, thank Heav'n, but in hell,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



Then Satan has travell'd again wi' his pack,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

And to her auld husband he's carried her back,

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.



I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life,

Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;

"But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,"

And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

Across the pool their arms unite,

Alike to screen the birdie's nest,

There the luver's treasure lies.

Adown the burn to steer, my jo:

Gie me the hour o' gloamin' grey,

It maks my heart sae cheery O,

To meet thee on the lea-rig,

Highland Mary



tune-"Katherine Ogie."



Ye banks, and braes, and streams around

The castle o' Montgomery!

Green be your woods, and fair your flowers,

Your waters never drumlie:

There Simmer first unfauld her robes,

And there the langest tarry;

For there I took the last Farewell

O' my sweet Highland Mary.



How sweetly bloom'd the gay, green birk,

How rich the hawthorn's blossom,

As underneath their fragrant shade,

I clasp'd her to my bosom!

The golden Hours on angel wings,

Flew o'er me and my Dearie;

For dear to me, as light and life,

Was my sweet Highland Mary.



Wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace,

Our parting was fu' tender;

And, pledging aft to meet again,

We tore oursels asunder;

But oh! fell Death's untimely frost,

That nipt my Flower sae early!

Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay

That wraps my Highland Mary!



O pale, pale now, those rosy lips,

I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly!

And clos'd for aye, the sparkling glance

That dwalt on me sae kindly!

And mouldering now in silent dust,

That heart that lo'ed me dearly!

But still within my bosom's core

Shall live my Highland Mary.



Auld Rob Morris



There's Auld Rob Morris that wons in yon glen,

He's the King o' gude fellows, and wale o' auld men;

He has gowd in his coffers, he has owsen and kine,

And ae bonie lass, his dautie and mine.



She's fresh as the morning, the fairest in May;

She's sweet as the ev'ning amang the new hay;

As blythe and as artless as the lambs on the lea,

And dear to my heart as the light to my e'e.



But oh! she's an Heiress, auld Robin's a laird,

And my daddie has nought but a cot-house and yard;

A wooer like me maunna hope to come speed,

The wounds I must hide that will soon be my dead.



The day comes to me, but delight brings me nane;

The night comes to me, but my rest it is gane;

I wander my lane like a night-troubled ghaist,

And I sigh as my heart it wad burst in my breast.



O had she but been of a lower degree,

I then might hae hop'd she wad smil'd upon me!

O how past descriving had then been my bliss,

As now my distraction nae words can express.



The Rights Of Woman



An Occasional Address.



Spoken by Miss Fontenelle on her benefit night, November 26, 1792.



While Europe's eye is fix'd on mighty things,

The fate of Empires and the fall of Kings;

While quacks of State must each produce his plan,

And even children lisp the Rights of Man;

Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention,

The Rights of Woman merit some attention.



First, in the Sexes' intermix'd connection,

One sacred Right of Woman is, protection. -

The tender flower that lifts its head, elate,

Helpless, must fall before the blasts of Fate,

Sunk on the earth, defac'd its lovely form,

Unless your shelter ward th' impending storm.



Our second Right-but needless here is caution,

To keep that right inviolate's the fashion;

Each man of sense has it so full before him,

He'd die before he'd wrong it-'tis decorum. -

There was, indeed, in far less polish'd days,

A time, when rough rude man had naughty ways,

Would swagger, swear, get drunk, kick up a riot,

Nay even thus invade a Lady's quiet.



Now, thank our stars! those Gothic times are fled;

Now, well-bred men-and you are all well-bred-

Most justly think (and we are much the gainers)

Such conduct neither spirit, wit, nor manners.



For Right the third, our last, our best, our dearest,

That right to fluttering female hearts the nearest;

Which even the Rights of Kings, in low prostration,

Most humbly own-'tis dear, dear admiration!

In that blest sphere alone we live and move;

There taste that life of life-immortal love.

Smiles, glances, sighs, tears, fits, flirtations, airs;

'Gainst such an host what flinty savage dares,

When awful Beauty joins with all her charms-

Who is so rash as rise in rebel arms?



But truce with kings, and truce with constitutions,

With bloody armaments and revolutions;

Let Majesty your first attention summon,

Ah! ca ira! The Majesty Of Woman!



Epigram On Seeing Miss Fontenelle In A Favourite Character



Sweet naivete of feature,

Simple, wild, enchanting elf,

Not to thee, but thanks to Nature,

Thou art acting but thyself.



Wert thou awkward, stiff, affected,

Spurning Nature, torturing art;

Loves and Graces all rejected,

Then indeed thou'd'st act a part.



Extempore On Some Commemorations Of Thomson



Dost thou not rise, indignant shade,

And smile wi' spurning scorn,

When they wha wad hae starved thy life,

Thy senseless turf adorn?



Helpless, alane, thou clamb the brae,

Wi' meikle honest toil,

And claught th' unfading garland there-

Thy sair-worn, rightful spoil.



And wear it thou! and call aloud

This axiom undoubted-

Would thou hae Nobles' patronage?

First learn to live without it!



To whom hae much, more shall be given,

Is every Great man's faith;

But he, the helpless, needful wretch,

Shall lose the mite he hath.
