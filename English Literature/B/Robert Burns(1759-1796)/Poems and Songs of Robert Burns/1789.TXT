Chorus.-Robin shure in hairst,

I shure wi' him.

Fient a heuk had I,

Yet I stack by him.



I gaed up to Dunse,

To warp a wab o' plaiden,

At his daddie's yett,

Wha met me but Robin:

Robin shure, &c.



Was na Robin bauld,

Tho' I was a cotter,

Play'd me sic a trick,

An' me the El'er's dochter!

Robin shure, &c.



Robin promis'd me

A' my winter vittle;

Fient haet he had but three

Guse-feathers and a whittle!

Robin shure, &c.



Ode, Sacred To The Memory Of Mrs. Oswald Of Auchencruive



Dweller in yon dungeon dark,

Hangman of creation! mark,

Who in widow-weeds appears,

Laden with unhonour'd years,

Noosing with care a bursting purse,

Baited with many a deadly curse?



Strophe



View the wither'd Beldam's face;

Can thy keen inspection trace

Aught of Humanity's sweet, melting grace?

Note that eye, 'tis rheum o'erflows;

Pity's flood there never rose,

See these hands ne'er stretched to save,

Hands that took, but never gave:

Keeper of Mammon's iron chest,

Lo, there she goes, unpitied and unblest,

She goes, but not to realms of everlasting rest!



Antistrophe



Plunderer of Armies! lift thine eyes,

(A while forbear, ye torturing fiends;)

Seest thou whose step, unwilling, hither bends?

No fallen angel, hurl'd from upper skies;

'Tis thy trusty quondam Mate,

Doom'd to share thy fiery fate;

She, tardy, hell-ward plies.



Epode



And are they of no more avail,

Ten thousand glittering pounds a-year?

In other worlds can Mammon fail,

Omnipotent as he is here!



O, bitter mockery of the pompous bier,

While down the wretched Vital Part is driven!

The cave-lodged Beggar,with a conscience clear,

Expires in rags, unknown, and goes to Heaven.



Pegasus At Wanlockhead



With Pegasus upon a day,

Apollo, weary flying,

Through frosty hills the journey lay,

On foot the way was plying.



Poor slipshod giddy Pegasus

Was but a sorry walker;

To Vulcan then Apollo goes,

To get a frosty caulker.



Obliging Vulcan fell to work,

Threw by his coat and bonnet,

And did Sol's business in a crack;

Sol paid him with a sonnet.



Ye Vulcan's sons of Wanlockhead,

Pity my sad disaster;

My Pegasus is poorly shod,

I'll pay you like my master.



Sappho Redivivus-A Fragment



By all I lov'd, neglected and forgot,

No friendly face e'er lights my squalid cot;

Shunn'd, hated, wrong'd, unpitied, unredrest,

The mock'd quotation of the scorner's jest!

Ev'n the poor support of my wretched life,

Snatched by the violence of legal strife.

Oft grateful for my very daily bread

To those my family's once large bounty fed;

A welcome inmate at their homely fare,

My griefs, my woes, my sighs, my tears they share:

(Their vulgar souls unlike the souls refin'd,

The fashioned marble of the polished mind).



In vain would Prudence, with decorous sneer,

Point out a censuring world, and bid me fear;

Above the world, on wings of Love, I rise-

I know its worst, and can that worst despise;

Let Prudence' direst bodements on me fall,

M[ontgomer]y, rich reward, o'erpays them all!



Mild zephyrs waft thee to life's farthest shore,

Nor think of me and my distress more, -

Falsehood accurst! No! still I beg a place,

Still near thy heart some little, little trace:

For that dear trace the world I would resign:

O let me live, and die, and think it mine!



"I burn, I burn, as when thro' ripen'd corn

By driving winds the crackling flames are borne;"

Now raving-wild, I curse that fatal night,

Then bless the hour that charm'd my guilty sight:

In vain the laws their feeble force oppose,

Chain'd at Love's feet, they groan, his vanquish'd foes.

In vain Religion meets my shrinking eye,

I dare not combat, but I turn and fly:

Conscience in vain upbraids th' unhallow'd fire,

Love grasps her scorpions-stifled they expire!

Reason drops headlong from his sacred throne,



Your dear idea reigns, and reigns alone;

Each thought intoxicated homage yields,

And riots wanton in forbidden fields.

By all on high adoring mortals know!

By all the conscious villain fears below!

By your dear self!-the last great oath I swear,

Not life, nor soul, were ever half so dear!



song-She's Fair And Fause



She's fair and fause that causes my smart,

I lo'ed her meikle and lang;

She's broken her vow, she's broken my heart,

And I may e'en gae hang.

A coof cam in wi' routh o' gear,

And I hae tint my dearest dear;

But Woman is but warld's gear,

Sae let the bonie lass gang.



Whae'er ye be that woman love,

To this be never blind;

Nae ferlie 'tis tho' fickle she prove,

A woman has't by kind.

O Woman lovely, Woman fair!

An angel form's faun to thy share,

'Twad been o'er meikle to gi'en thee mair-

I mean an angel mind.



Impromptu Lines To Captain Riddell



On Returning a Newspaper.



Your News and Review, sir.

I've read through and through, sir,

With little admiring or blaming;

The Papers are barren

Of home-news or foreign,

No murders or rapes worth the naming.



Our friends, the Reviewers,

Those chippers and hewers,

Are judges of mortar and stone, sir;

But of meet or unmeet,

In a fabric complete,

I'll boldly pronounce they are none, sir;



My goose-quill too rude is

To tell all your goodness

Bestow'd on your servant, the Poet;

Would to God I had one

Like a beam of the sun,

And then all the world, sir, should know it!



Lines To John M'Murdo, Esq. Of Drumlanrig



Sent with some of the Author's Poems.



O could I give thee India's wealth,

As I this trifle send;

Because thy joy in both would be

To share them with a friend.



But golden sands did never grace

The Heliconian stream;

Then take what gold could never buy-

An honest bard's esteem.



Rhyming Reply To A Note From Captain Riddell

Caledonia-A Ballad



tune-"Caledonian Hunts' Delight" of Mr. Gow.



There was once a day, but old Time wasythen young,

That brave Caledonia, the chief of her line,

From some of your northern deities sprung,

(Who knows not that brave Caledonia's divine?)

From Tweed to the Orcades was her domain,

To hunt, or to pasture, or do what she would:

Her heav'nly relations there fixed her reign,

And pledg'd her their godheads to warrant it good.



A lambkin in peace, but a lion in war,

The pride of her kindred, the heroine grew:

Her grandsire, old Odin, triumphantly swore, -

"Whoe'er shall provoke thee, th' encounter shall rue!"

With tillage or pasture at times she would sport,

To feed her fair flocks by her green rustling corn;

But chiefly the woods were her fav'rite resort,

Her darling amusement, the hounds and the horn.



Long quiet she reigned; till thitherward steers

A flight of bold eagles from Adria's strand:

Repeated, successive, for many long years,

They darken'd the air, and they plunder'd the land:

Their pounces were murder, and terror their cry,

They'd conquer'd and ruin'd a world beside;

She took to her hills, and her arrows let fly,

The daring invaders they fled or they died.



The Cameleon-Savage disturb'd her repose,

With tumult, disquiet, rebellion, and strife;

Provok'd beyond bearing, at last she arose,

And robb'd him at once of his hopes and his life:

The Anglian lion, the terror of France,

Oft prowling, ensanguin'd the Tweed's silver flood;

But, taught by the bright Caledonian lance,

He learned to fear in his own native wood.



The fell Harpy-raven took wing from the north,

The scourge of the seas, and the dread of the shore;

The wild Scandinavian boar issued forth

To wanton in carnage and wallow in gore:

O'er countries and kingdoms their fury prevail'd,

No arts could appease them, no arms could repel;

But brave Caledonia in vain they assail'd,

As Largs well can witness, and Loncartie tell.



Thus bold, independent, unconquer'd, and free,

Her bright course of glory for ever shall run:

For brave Caledonia immortal must be;

I'll prove it from Euclid as clear as the sun:

Rectangle-triangle, the figure we'll chuse:

The upright is Chance, and old Time is the base;

But brave Caledonia's the hypothenuse;

Then, ergo, she'll match them, and match them always.



To Miss Cruickshank



A very Young Lady



     Written on the Blank Leaf of a Book, presented to her by the Author.



Beauteous Rosebud, young and gay,

Blooming in thy early May,

Never may'st thou, lovely flower,

Chilly shrink in sleety shower!

Never Boreas' hoary path,

Never Eurus' pois'nous breath,

Never baleful stellar lights,

Taint thee with untimely blights!

Never, never reptile thief

Riot on thy virgin leaf!

Nor even Sol too fiercely view

Thy bosom blushing still with dew!



May'st thou long, sweet crimson gem,

Richly deck thy native stem;

Till some ev'ning, sober, calm,

Dropping dews, and breathing balm,

While all around the woodland rings,

And ev'ry bird thy requiem sings;

Thou, amid the dirgeful sound,

Shed thy dying honours round,

And resign to parent Earth

The loveliest form she e'er gave birth.



Beware O' Bonie Ann



Ye gallants bright, I rede you right,

Beware o' bonie Ann;

Her comely face sae fu' o' grace,

Your heart she will trepan:

Her een sae bright, like stars by night,

Her skin sae like the swan;

Sae jimply lac'd her genty waist,

That sweetly ye might span.



Youth, Grace, and Love attendant move,

And pleasure leads the van:

In a' their charms, and conquering arms,

They wait on bonie Ann.

The captive bands may chain the hands,

But love enslaves the man:

Ye gallants braw, I rede you a',

Beware o' bonie Ann!



Ode On The Departed Regency Bill



(March, 1789)



Daughter of Chaos' doting years,

Nurse of ten thousand hopes and fears,

Whether thy airy, insubstantial shade

(The rights of sepulture now duly paid)

Spread abroad its hideous form

On the roaring civil storm,

Deafening din and warring rage

Factions wild with factions wage;

Or under-ground, deep-sunk, profound,

Among the demons of the earth,

With groans that make the mountains shake,

Thou mourn thy ill-starr'd, blighted birth;

Or in the uncreated Void,

Where seeds of future being fight,

With lessen'd step thou wander wide,

To greet thy Mother-Ancient Night.

And as each jarring, monster-mass is past,

Fond recollect what once thou wast:

In manner due, beneath this sacred oak,

Hear, Spirit, hear! thy presence I invoke!

By a Monarch's heaven-struck fate,

By a disunited State,

By a generous Prince's wrongs.

By a Senate's strife of tongues,

By a Premier's sullen pride,

Louring on the changing tide;

By dread Thurlow's powers to awe

Rhetoric, blasphemy and law;

By the turbulent ocean-

A Nation's commotion,

By the harlot-caresses

Of borough addresses,

By days few and evil,

(Thy portion, poor devil!)

By Power, Wealth, and Show,

(The Gods by men adored,)

By nameless Poverty,

(Their hell abhorred,)

By all they hope, by all they fear,

Hear! and appear!



Stare not on me, thou ghastly Power!

Nor, grim with chained defiance, lour:

No Babel-structure would I build

Where, order exil'd from his native sway,

Confusion may the regent-sceptre wield,

While all would rule and none obey:

Go, to the world of man relate

The story of thy sad, eventful fate;

And call presumptuous Hope to hear

And bid him check his blind career;

And tell the sore-prest sons of Care,

Never, never to despair!

Paint Charles' speed on wings of fire,

The object of his fond desire,

Beyond his boldest hopes, at hand:

Paint all the triumph of the Portland Band;

Hark how they lift the joy-elated voice!

And who are these that equally rejoice?

Jews, Gentiles, what a motley crew!

The iron tears their flinty cheeks bedew;

See how unfurled the parchment ensigns fly,

And Principal and Interest all the cry!

And how their num'rous creditors rejoice;

But just as hopes to warm enjoyment rise,

Cry Convalescence! and the vision flies.

Then next pourtray a dark'ning twilight gloom,

Eclipsing sad a gay, rejoicing morn,

While proud Ambition to th' untimely tomb

By gnashing, grim, despairing fiends is borne:

Paint ruin, in the shape of high D[undas]

Gaping with giddy terror o'er the brow;

In vain he struggles, the fates behind him press,

And clam'rous hell yawns for her prey below:

How fallen That, whose pride late scaled the skies!

And This, like Lucifer, no more to rise!

Again pronounce the powerful word;

See Day, triumphant from the night, restored.



Then know this truth, ye Sons of Men!

(Thus ends thy moral tale,)

Your darkest terrors may be vain,

Your brightest hopes may fail.



Epistle To James Tennant Of Glenconner



Auld comrade dear, and brither sinner,

How's a' the folk about Glenconner?

How do you this blae eastlin wind,

That's like to blaw a body blind?

For me, my faculties are frozen,

My dearest member nearly dozen'd.

I've sent you here, by Johnie Simson,

Twa sage philosophers to glimpse on;

Smith, wi' his sympathetic feeling,

An' Reid, to common sense appealing.

Philosophers have fought and wrangled,

An' meikle Greek an' Latin mangled,

Till wi' their logic-jargon tir'd,

And in the depth of science mir'd,

To common sense they now appeal,

What wives and wabsters see and feel.

But, hark ye, friend! I charge you strictly,

Peruse them, an' return them quickly:

For now I'm grown sae cursed douce

I pray and ponder butt the house;

My shins, my lane, I there sit roastin',

Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an' Boston,

Till by an' by, if I haud on,

I'll grunt a real gospel-groan:

Already I begin to try it,

To cast my e'en up like a pyet,

When by the gun she tumbles o'er

Flutt'ring an' gasping in her gore:

Sae shortly you shall see me bright,

A burning an' a shining light.



My heart-warm love to guid auld Glen,

The ace an' wale of honest men:

When bending down wi' auld grey hairs

Beneath the load of years and cares,

May He who made him still support him,

An' views beyond the grave comfort him;

His worthy fam'ly far and near,

God bless them a' wi' grace and gear!



My auld schoolfellow, Preacher Willie,

The manly tar, my mason-billie,

And Auchenbay, I wish him joy,

If he's a parent, lass or boy,

May he be dad, and Meg the mither,

Just five-and-forty years thegither!

And no forgetting wabster Charlie,

I'm tauld he offers very fairly.

An' Lord, remember singing Sannock,

Wi' hale breeks, saxpence, an' a bannock!

And next, my auld acquaintance, Nancy,

Since she is fitted to her fancy,

An' her kind stars hae airted till her

gA guid chiel wi' a pickle siller.

My kindest, best respects, I sen' it,

To cousin Kate, an' sister Janet:

Tell them, frae me, wi' chiels be cautious,

For, faith, they'll aiblins fin' them fashious;

To grant a heart is fairly civil,

But to grant a maidenhead's the devil.

An' lastly, Jamie, for yoursel,

May guardian angels tak a spell,

An' steer you seven miles south o' hell:

But first, before you see heaven's glory,

May ye get mony a merry story,

Mony a laugh, and mony a drink,

And aye eneugh o' needfu' clink.



Now fare ye weel, an' joy be wi' you:

For my sake, this I beg it o' you,

Assist poor Simson a' ye can,

Ye'll fin; him just an honest man;

Sae I conclude, and quat my chanter,

Your's, saint or sinner,

A New Psalm For The Chapel Of Kilmarnock



     On the Thanksgiving-Day for His Majesty's Recovery.



O sing a new song to the Lord,

Make, all and every one,

A joyful noise, even for the King

His restoration.



The sons of Belial in the land

Did set their heads together;

Come, let us sweep them off, said they,

Like an o'erflowing river.



They set their heads together, I say,

They set their heads together;

On right, on left, on every hand,

We saw none to deliver.



Thou madest strong two chosen ones

To quell the Wicked's pride;

That Young Man, great in Issachar,

The burden-bearing tribe.



And him, among the Princes chief

In our Jerusalem,

The judge that's mighty in thy law,

The man that fears thy name.



Yet they, even they, with all their strength,

Began to faint and fail:

Even as two howling, ravenous wolves

To dogs do turn their tail.



Th' ungodly o'er the just prevail'd,

For so thou hadst appointed;

That thou might'st greater glory give

Unto thine own anointed.



And now thou hast restored our State,

Pity our Kirk also;

For she by tribulations

Is now brought very low.



Consume that high-place, Patronage,

From off thy holy hill;

And in thy fury burn the book-

Even of that man M'Gill.^1



Now hear our prayer, accept our song,

And fight thy chosen's battle:

We seek but little, Lord, from thee,

Thou kens we get as little.

Sketch In Verse



     Inscribed to the Right Hon. C. J. Fox.



How wisdom and Folly meet, mix, and unite,

How Virtue and Vice blend their black and their white,

How Genius, th' illustrious father of fiction,

Confounds rule and law, reconciles contradiction,

I sing: If these mortals, the critics, should bustle,

I care not, not I-let the Critics go whistle!



But now for a Patron whose name and whose glory,

At once may illustrate and honour my story.



Thou first of our orators, first of our wits;

Yet whose parts and acquirements seem just lucky hits;

With knowledge so vast, and with judgment so strong,

No man with the half of 'em e'er could go wrong;

With passions so potent, and fancies so bright,

No man with the half of 'em e'er could go right;

A sorry, poor, misbegot son of the Muses,

For using thy name, offers fifty excuses.

Good Lord, what is Man! for as simple he looks,

Do but try to develop his hooks and his crooks;

With his depths and his shallows, his good and his evil,

All in all he's a problem must puzzle the devil.



On his one ruling passion Sir Pope hugely labours,

That, like th' old Hebrew walking-switch, eats up its neighbours:

Mankind are his show-box-a friend, would you know him?

Pull the string, Ruling Passion the picture will show him,

What pity, in rearing so beauteous a system,

One trifling particular, Truth, should have miss'd him;

For, spite of his fine theoretic positions,

Mankind is a science defies definitions.



Some sort all our qualities each to its tribe,

And think human nature they truly describe;

Have you found this, or t'other? There's more in the wind;

As by one drunken fellow his comrades you'll find.

But such is the flaw, or the depth of the plan,

In the make of that wonderful creature called Man,

No two virtues, whatever relation they claim.

Nor even two different shades of the same,

Though like as was ever twin brother to brother,

Possessing the one shall imply you've the other.



But truce with abstraction, and truce with a Muse

Whose rhymes you'll perhaps, Sir, ne'er deign to peruse:

Will you leave your justings, your jars, and your quarrels,

Contending with Billy for proud-nodding laurels?

My much-honour'd Patron, believe your poor poet,

Your courage, much more than your prudence, you show it:

In vain with Squire Billy for laurels you struggle:

He'll have them by fair trade, if not, he will smuggle:

Not cabinets even of kings would conceal 'em,

He'd up the back stairs, and by God, he would steal 'em,

Then feats like Squire Billy's you ne'er can achieve 'em;

It is not, out-do him-the task is, out-thieve him!



The Wounded Hare



Inhuman man! curse on thy barb'rous art,

And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye;

May never pity soothe thee with a sigh,

Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart!



Go live, poor wand'rer of the wood and field!

The bitter little that of life remains:

No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains

To thee a home, or food, or pastime yield.



Seek, mangled wretch, some place of wonted rest,

No more of rest, but now thy dying bed!

The sheltering rushes whistling o'er thy head,

The cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest.



Perhaps a mother's anguish adds its woe;

The playful pair crowd fondly by thy side;

Ah! helpless nurslings, who will now provide

That life a mother only can bestow!



Oft as by winding Nith I, musing, wait

The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn,

I'll miss thee sporting o'er the dewy lawn,

And curse the ruffian's aim, and mourn thy hapless fate.



Delia, An Ode



     "To the Editor of The Star.-Mr. Printer-If the productions of a simple

ploughman can merit a place in the same paper with Sylvester Otway, and the

Fair the face of orient day,

Fair the tints of op'ning rose;

More lovely far her beauty shows.



Sweet the lark's wild warbled lay,

Sweet the tinkling rill to hear;

The rosy banquet loves to sip;

Sweet the streamlet's limpid lapse

To the sun-brown'd Arab's lip.



But, Delia, on thy balmy lips

Let me, no vagrant insect, rove;

O let me steal one liquid kiss,

For Oh! my soul is parch'd with love.



The Gard'ner Wi' His Paidle



tune-"The Gardener's March."



When rosy May comes in wi' flowers,

To deck her gay, green-spreading bowers,

Then busy, busy are his hours,

The Gard'ner wi' his paidle.



The crystal waters gently fa',

The merry bards are lovers a',

The scented breezes round him blaw-

The Gard'ner wi' his paidle.



When purple morning starts the hare

To steal upon her early fare;

Then thro' the dews he maun repair-

The Gard'ner wi' his paidle.



When day, expiring in the west,

The curtain draws o' Nature's rest,

He flies to her arms he lo'es the best,

The Gard'ner wi' his paidle.



On A Bank Of Flowers



On a bank of flowers, in a summer day,

For summer lightly drest,

The youthful, blooming Nelly lay,

With love and sleep opprest;

When Willie, wand'ring thro' the wood,

Who for her favour oft had sued;

He gaz'd, he wish'd

He fear'd, he blush'd,

And trembled where he stood.



Her closed eyes, like weapons sheath'd,

Were seal'd in soft repose;

Her lip, still as she fragrant breath'd,

It richer dyed the rose;

The springing lilies, sweetly prest,

Wild-wanton kissed her rival breast;

He gaz'd, he wish'd,

He mear'd, he blush'd,

His bosom ill at rest.



Her robes, light-waving in the breeze,

Her tender limbs embrace;

Her lovely form, her native ease,

All harmony and grace;

Tumultuous tides his pulses roll,

A faltering, ardent kiss he stole;

He gaz'd, he wish'd,

He fear'd, he blush'd,

And sigh'd his very soul.



As flies the partridge from the brake,

On fear-inspired wings,

So Nelly, starting, half-awake,

Away affrighted springs;

But Willie follow'd-as he should,

He overtook her in the wood;

He vow'd, he pray'd,

He found the maid

Forgiving all, and good.

The Banks Of Nith



The Thames flows proudly to the sea,

Must wayward Fortune's adverse hand

For ever, ever keep me here!

Far from thy bonie banks and braes,

May there my latest hours consume,

Amang the friends of early days!

Wha first beside his chair shall fa',

He is the King amang us three.

We are na fou, &c.

Ca' them where the heather grows,

Ca' them where the burnie rowes,

My bonie dearie

There I met my shepherd lad:

He row'd me sweetly in his plaid,

Ye sall be my dearie.

I Gaed A Waefu' Gate Yestreen



I gaed a waefu' gate yestreen,

A gate, I fear, I'll dearly rue;

I gat my death frae twa sweet een,

Twa lovely een o'bonie blue.



'Twas not her golden ringlets bright,

Her lips like roses wat wi' dew,

Her heaving bosom, lily-white-

It was her een sae bonie blue.



She talk'd, she smil'd, my heart she wyl'd;

She charm'd my soul I wist na how;

And aye the stound, the deadly wound,

Cam frae her een so bonie blue.

But "spare to speak, and spare to speed;"

She'll aiblins listen to my vow:

Should she refuse, I'll lay my dead

To her twa een sae bonie blue.



Highland Harry Back Again



My Harry was a gallant gay,

Fu' stately strade he on the plain;

But now he's banish'd far away,

I'll never see him back again.



Chorus.-O for him back again!

O for him back again!

I wad gie a' Knockhaspie's land

For Highland Harry back again.



When a' the lave gae to their bed,

I wander dowie up the glen;

I set me down and greet my fill,

And aye I wish him back again.

O for him, &c.



O were some villains hangit high,

And ilka body had their ain!

Then I might see the joyfu' sight,

My Highland Harry back again.

O for him, &c.

"O cam ye here the fight to shun,

Or herd the sheep wi' me, man?

Or were ye at the Sherra-moor,

Or did the battle see, man?"

I saw the battle, sair and teugh,

And reekin-red ran mony a sheugh;

My heart, for fear, gaed sough for sough,

To hear the thuds, and see the cluds

O' clans frae woods, in tartan duds,

Wha glaum'd at kingdoms three, man.

La, la, la, la, &c.



The red-coat lads, wi' black cockauds,

To meet them were na slaw, man;

They rush'd and push'd, and blude outgush'd

And mony a bouk did fa', man:

The great Argyle led on his files,

I wat they glanced twenty miles;

They hough'd the clans like nine-pin kyles,

They hack'd and hash'd, while braid-swords, clash'd,

And thro' they dash'd, and hew'd and smash'd,

Till fey men died awa, man.

La, la, la, la, &c.



But had ye seen the philibegs,

And skyrin tartan trews, man;

When in the teeth they dar'd our Whigs,

And covenant True-blues, man:

In lines extended lang and large,

When baiginets o'erpower'd the targe,

And thousands hasten'd to the charge;

Wi' Highland wrath they frae the sheath

Drew blades o' death, till, out o' breath,

They fled like frighted dows, man!

La, la, la, la, &c.



"O how deil, Tam, can that be true?

The chase gaed frae the north, man;

I saw mysel, they did pursue,

The horsemen back to Forth, man;

And at Dunblane, in my ain sight,

They took the brig wi' a' their might,

And straught to Stirling wing'd their flight;

But, cursed lot! the gates were shut;

And mony a huntit poor red-coat,

For fear amaist did swarf, man!"

La, la, la, la, &c.



My sister Kate cam up the gate

Wi' crowdie unto me, man;

She swoor she saw some rebels run

To Perth unto Dundee, man;

Their left-hand general had nae skill;

The Angus lads had nae gude will

That day their neibors' blude to spill;

For fear, for foes, that they should lose

Their cogs o' brose; they scar'd at blows,

And hameward fast did flee, man.

La, la, la, la, &c.



They've lost some gallant gentlemen,

Amang the Highland clans, man!

I fear my Lord Panmure is slain,

Or fallen in Whiggish hands, man,

Now wad ye sing this double fight,

Some fell for wrang, and some for right;

But mony bade the world gude-night;

Then ye may tell, how pell and mell,

By red claymores, and muskets knell,

Wi' dying yell, the Tories fell,

And Whigs to hell did flee, man.

La, la, la, la, &c.

Whare hae ye been sae brankie, O?

Whare hae ye been sae braw, lad?

At hame I faught my Auntie, O;

But I met the devil an' Dundee,

On the Braes o' Killiecrankie, O.

An ye had been, &c.



The bauld Pitcur fell in a furr,

An' Clavers gat a clankie, O;

Awa' Whigs, awa'!

Ye're but a pack o' traitor louns,

Ye'll do nae gude at a'.



Our thrissles flourish'd fresh and fair,

And bonie bloom'd our roses;

But Whigs cam' like a frost in June,

An' wither'd a' our posies.

Awa' Whigs, &c.



Our ancient crown's fa'en in the dust-

Deil blin' them wi' the stoure o't!

An' write their names in his black beuk,

Wha gae the Whigs the power o't.

Awa' Whigs, &c.



Our sad decay in church and state

Surpasses my descriving:

The Whigs cam' o'er us for a curse,

An' we hae done wi' thriving.

Awa' Whigs, &c.



Grim vengeance lang has taen a nap,

But we may see him wauken:

Gude help the day when royal heads

Are hunted like a maukin!

Awa' Whigs, &c.



A Waukrife Minnie



Whare are you gaun, my bonie lass,

Whare are you gaun, my hinnie?

She answered me right saucilie,

"An errand for my minnie."



O whare live ye, my bonie lass,

O whare live ye, my hinnie?

"By yon burnside, gin ye maun ken,

In a wee house wi' my minnie."



But I foor up the glen at e'en.

To see my bonie lassie;

And lang before the grey morn cam,

She was na hauf sae saucie.



O weary fa' the waukrife cock,

And the foumart lay his crawin!

He wauken'd the auld wife frae her sleep,

A wee blink or the dawin.



An angry wife I wat she raise,

And o'er the bed she brocht her;

And wi' a meikle hazel rung

She made her a weel-pay'd dochter.



O fare thee weel, my bonie lass,

O fare thee well, my hinnie!

Thou art a gay an' a bonnie lass,

But thou has a waukrife minnie.



The Captive Ribband



tune-"Robaidh dona gorach."



Dear Myra, the captive ribband's mine,

'Twas all my faithful love could gain;

And would you ask me to resign

The sole reward that crowns my pain?



Go, bid the hero who has run

Thro' fields of death to gather fame,

Go, bid him lay his laurels down,

And all his well-earn'd praise disclaim.



The ribband shall its freedom lose-

Lose all the bliss it had with you,

And share the fate I would impose

On thee, wert thou my captive too.



It shall upon my bosom live,

Or clasp me in a close embrace;

And at its fortune if you grieve,

Retrieve its doom, and take its place.



My Heart's In The Highlands



tune-"Failte na Miosg."



Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,

The birth-place of Valour, the country of Worth;

Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,

The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.



Chorus.-My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here,

My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;

Chasing the wild-deer, and following the roe,

My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go.



Farewell to the mountains, high-cover'd with snow,

Farewell to the straths and green vallies below;

Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods,

Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.

My heart's in the Highlands, &c.



The Whistle-A Ballad



I sing of a Whistle, a Whistle of worth,

I sing of a Whistle, the pride of the North.

Was brought to the court of our good Scottish King,

And long with this Whistle all Scotland shall ring.



Old Loda, still rueing the arm of Fingal,

The god of the bottle sends down from his hall-

"The Whistle's your challenge, to Scotland get o'er,

And drink them to hell, Sir! or ne'er see me more!"



Old poets have sung, and old chronicles tell,

What champions ventur'd, what champions fell:

The son of great Loda was conqueror still,

And blew on the Whistle their requiem shrill.



Till Robert, the lord of the Cairn and the Scaur,

Unmatch'd at the bottle, unconquer'd in war,

He drank his poor god-ship as deep as the sea;

No tide of the Baltic e'er drunker than he.



Thus Robert, victorious, the trophy has gain'd;

Which now in his house has for ages remain'd;

Till three noble chieftains, and all of his blood,

The jovial contest again have renew'd.



Three joyous good fellows, with hearts clear of flaw

Craigdarroch, so famous for with, worth, and law;

And trusty Glenriddel, so skill'd in old coins;

And gallant Sir Robert, deep-read in old wines.



Craigdarroch began, with a tongue smooth as oil,

Desiring Downrightly to yield up the spoil;

Or else he would muster the heads of the clan,

And once more, in claret, try which was the man.



"By the gods of the ancients!" Downrightly replies,

"Before I surrender so glorious a prize,

I'll conjure the ghost of the great Rorie More,

And bumper his horn with him twenty times o'er."



Sir Robert, a soldier, no speech would pretend,

But he ne'er turn'd his back on his foe, or his friend;

Said, "Toss down the Whistle, the prize of the field,"

And, knee-deep in claret, he'd die ere he'd yield.



To the board of Glenriddel our heroes repair,

So noted for drowning of sorrow and care;

But, for wine and for welcome, not more known to fame,

Than the sense, wit, and taste, of a sweet lovely dame.



A bard was selected to witness the fray,

And tell future ages the feats of the day;

A Bard who detested all sadness and spleen,

And wish'd that Parnassus a vineyard had been.



The dinner being over, the claret they ply,

And ev'ry new cork is a new spring of joy;

In the bands of old friendship and kindred so set,

And the bands grew the tighter the more they were wet.



Gay Pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran o'er:

Bright Phoebus ne'er witness'd so joyous a core,

And vow'd that to leave them he was quite forlorn,

Till Cynthia hinted he'd see them next morn.



Six bottles a-piece had well wore out the night,

When gallant Sir Robert, to finish the fight,

Turn'd o'er in one bumper a bottle of red,

And swore 'twas the way that their ancestor did.



Then worthy Glenriddel, so cautious and sage,

No longer the warfare ungodly would wage;

A high Ruling Elder to wallow in wine;

He left the foul business to folks less divine.



The gallant Sir Robert fought hard to the end;

But who can with Fate and quart bumpers contend!

Though Fate said, a hero should perish in light;

So uprose bright Phoebus-and down fell the knight.



Next uprose our Bard, like a prophet in drink:-

"Craigdarroch, thou'lt soar when creation shall sink!

But if thou would flourish immortal in rhyme,

Come-one bottle more-and have at the sublime!



"Thy line, that have struggled for freedom with Bruce,

Shall heroes and patriots ever produce:

So thine be the laurel, and mine be the bay;

The field thou hast won, by yon bright god of day!"



To Mary In Heaven



Thou ling'ring star, with lessening ray,

That lov'st to greet the early morn,

Again thou usher'st in the day

My Mary from my soul was torn.

O Mary! dear departed shade!

Where is thy place of blissful rest?

See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?

Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?



That sacred hour can I forget,

Can I forget the hallow'd grove,

Where, by the winding Ayr, we met,

To live one day of parting love!

Eternity will not efface

Those records dear of transports past,

Thy image at our last embrace,

Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!



Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore,

O'erhung with wild-woods, thickening green;

The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar,

'Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene:

The flowers sprang wanton to be prest,

The birds sang love on every spray;

Till too, too soon, the glowing west,

Proclaim'd the speed of winged day.



Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes,

And fondly broods with miser-care;

Time but th' impression stronger makes,

As streams their channels deeper wear,

My Mary! dear departed shade!

Where is thy blissful place of rest?

See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?

Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?



Epistle To Dr. Blacklock



Ellisland, 21st Oct., 1789.



Wow, but your letter made me vauntie!

And are ye hale, and weel and cantie?

I ken'd it still, your wee bit jauntie

Wad bring ye to:

Lord send you aye as weel's I want ye!

And then ye'll do.



The ill-thief blaw the Heron south!

And never drink be near his drouth!

He tauld myself by word o' mouth,

He'd tak my letter;

I lippen'd to the chiel in trouth,

And bade nae better.



But aiblins, honest Master Heron

Had, at the time, some dainty fair one

To ware this theologic care on,

And holy study;

And tired o' sauls to waste his lear on,

E'en tried the body.



But what d'ye think, my trusty fere,

I'm turned a gauger-Peace be here!

Parnassian queans, I fear, I fear,

Ye'll now disdain me!

And then my fifty pounds a year

Will little gain me.



Ye glaikit, gleesome, dainty damies,

Wha, by Castalia's wimplin streamies,

Lowp, sing, and lave your pretty limbies,

Ye ken, ye ken,

That strang necessity supreme is

'Mang sons o' men.



I hae a wife and twa wee laddies;

They maun hae brose and brats o' duddies;

Ye ken yoursels my heart right proud is-

I need na vaunt

But I'll sned besoms, thraw saugh woodies,

Before they want.



Lord help me thro' this warld o' care!

I'm weary sick o't late and air!

Not but I hae a richer share

Than mony ithers;

But why should ae man better fare,

And a' men brithers?



Come, Firm Resolve, take thou the van,

Thou stalk o' carl-hemp in man!

And let us mind, faint heart ne'er wan

A lady fair:

Wha does the utmost that he can,

Will whiles do mair.



But to conclude my silly rhyme

(I'm scant o' verse and scant o' time),

To make a happy fireside clime

To weans and wife,

That's the true pathos and sublime

Of human life.



My compliments to sister Beckie,

And eke the same to honest Lucky;

I wat she is a daintie chuckie,

As e'er tread clay;

And gratefully, my gude auld cockie,

I'm yours for aye.

The Five Carlins



An Election Ballad.



tune-"Chevy Chase."



There was five Carlins in the South,

They fell upon a scheme,

To send a lad to London town,

To bring them tidings hame.



Nor only bring them tidings hame,

But do their errands there,

And aiblins gowd and honor baith

Might be that laddie's share.



There was Maggy by the banks o' Nith,

A dame wi' pride eneugh;

And Marjory o' the mony Lochs,

A Carlin auld and teugh.



And blinkin Bess of Annandale,

That dwelt near Solway-side;

And whisky Jean, that took her gill,

In Galloway sae wide.



And auld black Joan frae Crichton Peel,^1

O' gipsy kith an' kin;

Five wighter Carlins were na found

The South countrie within.



To send a lad to London town,

They met upon a day;

And mony a knight, and mony a laird,

This errand fain wad gae.



O mony a knight, and mony a laird,

This errand fain wad gae;

But nae ane could their fancy please,

O ne'er a ane but twae.



The first ane was a belted Knight,

Bred of a Border band;^2

And he wad gae to London town,

Might nae man him withstand.



And he wad do their errands weel,

And meikle he wad say;

And ilka ane about the court

Wad bid to him gude -day.



[Footnote 1: Sanquhar.]



[Footnote 2: Sir James Johnston of Westerhall.]



The neist cam in a Soger youth,^3

Who spak wi' modest grace,

And he wad gae to London town,

If sae their pleasure was.



He wad na hecht them courtly gifts,

Nor meikle speech pretend;

But he wad hecht an honest heart,

Wad ne'er desert his friend.



Now, wham to chuse, and wham refuse,

At strife thir Carlins fell;

For some had Gentlefolks to please,

And some wad please themsel'.



Then out spak mim-mou'd Meg o' Nith,

And she spak up wi' pride,

And she wad send the Soger youth,

Whatever might betide.



For the auld Gudeman o' London court^4

She didna care a pin;

But she wad send the Soger youth,

To greet his eldest son.^5



Then up sprang Bess o' Annandale,

And a deadly aith she's ta'en,

That she wad vote the Border Knight,

Though she should vote her lane.



"For far-off fowls hae feathers fair,

And fools o' change are fain;

But I hae tried the Border Knight,

And I'll try him yet again."



Says black Joan frae Crichton Peel,

A Carlin stoor and grim.

"The auld Gudeman or young Gudeman,

For me may sink or swim;



[Footnote 3: Captain Patrick Millar of Dalswinton.]



[Footnote 4: The King.]



[Footnote 5: The Prince of Wales.]



For fools will prate o' right or wrang,

While knaves laugh them to scorn;

But the Soger's friends hae blawn the best,

So he shall bear the horn."



Then whisky Jean spak owre her drink,

"Ye weel ken, kimmers a',

The auld gudeman o' London court,

His back's been at the wa';



"And mony a friend that kiss'd his caup

Is now a fremit wight;

But it's ne'er be said o' whisky Jean-

We'll send the Border Knight."



Then slow raise Marjory o' the Lochs,

And wrinkled was her brow,

Her ancient weed was russet gray,

Her auld Scots bluid was true;



"There's some great folk set light by me,

I set as light by them;

But I will send to London town

Wham I like best at hame."



Sae how this mighty plea may end,

Nae mortal wight can tell;

God grant the King and ilka man

Prologue Spoken At The Theatre Of Dumfries



     On New Year's Day Evening, 1790.



No song nor dance I bring from yon great city,

That queens it o'er our taste-the more's the pity:

Tho' by the bye, abroad why will you roam?

Good sense and taste are natives here at home:

But not for panegyric I appear,

I come to wish you all a good New Year!

Old Father Time deputes me here before ye,

Not for to preach, but tell his simple story:

The sage, grave Ancient cough'd, and bade me say,

"You're one year older this important day,"

If wiser too-he hinted some suggestion,

But 'twould be rude, you know, to ask the question;

And with a would-be roguish leer and wink,

Said-"Sutherland, in one word, bid them Think!"



Ye sprightly youths, quite flush with hope and spirit,

Who think to storm the world by dint of merit,

To you the dotard has a deal to say,

In his sly, dry, sententious, proverb way!

He bids you mind, amid your thoughtless rattle,

That the first blow is ever half the battle;

That tho' some by the skirt may try to snatch him,

Yet by the foreclock is the hold to catch him;

That whether doing, suffering, or forbearing,

You may do miracles by persevering.



Last, tho' not least in love, ye youthful fair,

Angelic forms, high Heaven's peculiar care!

To you old Bald-pate smoothes his wrinkled brow,

And humbly begs you'll mind the important-Now!

To crown your happiness he asks your leave,

And offers, bliss to give and to receive.



For our sincere, tho' haply weak endeavours,

With grateful pride we own your many favours;

And howsoe'er our tongues may ill reveal it,

Believe our glowing bosoms truly feel it.
