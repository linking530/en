<P>Then said Diabolus, 'O ye stout Diabolonians, be it known

<P>unto you, that there is treachery hatched against us in the

<P>rebellious town of Mansoul; for albeit the town is in our

<P>possession, as you see, yet these miserable Mansoulians have

<P>attempted to dare, and have been so hardy as yet to send to

<P>the court to Emmanuel for help.&nbsp; This I give you to

<P>understand, that ye may yet know how to carry it to the

<P>wretched town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore, O my trusty

<P>Diabolonians, I command that yet more and more ye distress

<P>this town of Mansoul, and vex it with your wiles, ravish

<P>their women, deflower their virgins, slay their children,

<P>brain their ancients, fire their town, and what other

<P>mischief you can; and let this be the reward of the

<P>Mansoulians from me, for their desperate rebellions against

<P>me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This, you see, was the charge; but something stepped in

<P>betwixt that and execution, for as yet there was but little

<P>more done than to rage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Moreover, when Diabolus had done thus, he went the next way

<P>up to the castle gates, and demanded that, upon pain of

<P>death, the gates should be opened to him, and that entrance

<P>should be given him and his men that followed after.&nbsp; To whom

<P>Mr. Godly-Fear replied, (for he it was that had the charge of

<P>that gate,) that the gate should not be opened unto him, nor

<P>to the men that followed after him.&nbsp; He said, moreover, that

<P>Mansoul, when she had suffered awhile, should be made

<P>perfect, strengthened, settled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Diabolus, 'Deliver me, then, the men that have

<P>petitioned against me, especially Captain Credence, that

<P>carried it to your Prince; deliver that varlet into my hands,

<P>and I will depart from the town.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then up starts a Diabolonian, whose name was Mr. Fooling, and

<P>said, 'My lord offereth you fair: it is better for you that

<P>one man perish, than that your whole Mansoul should be

<P>undone.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mr. Godly-Fear made him this replication, 'How long will

<P>Mansoul be kept out of the dungeon, when she hath given up

<P>her faith to Diabolus!&nbsp; As good lose the town, as lose

<P>Captain Credence; for if one be gone the other must follow.'

<P>But to that Mr. Fooling said nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then did my Lord Mayor reply, and said, 'O thou devouring

<P>tyrant, be it known unto thee, we shall hearken to none of

<P>thy words; we are resolved to resist thee as long as a

<P>captain, a man, a sling, and a stone to throw at thee shall

<P>be found in the town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; But Diabolus answered, 'Do

<P>you hope, do you wait, do you look for help and deliverance?

<P>You have sent to Emmanuel, but your wickedness sticks too

<P>close in your skirts, to let innocent prayers come out of

<P>your lips.&nbsp; Think you that you shall be prevailers and

<P>prosper in this design?&nbsp; You will fail in your wish, you will

<P>fail in your attempts; for it is not only I, but your

<P>Emmanuel is against you: yea, it is he that hath sent me

<P>against you to subdue you.&nbsp; For what, then, do you hope? or

<P>by what means will you escape?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Lord Mayor, 'We have sinned indeed; but that

<P>shall be no help to thee, for our Emmanuel hath said it, and

<P>that in great faithfulness, "and him that cometh to me I will

<P>in no wise cast out."&nbsp; He hath also told us, O our enemy,

<P>that "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven" to

<P>the sons of men.&nbsp; Therefore we dare not despair, but will

<P>look for, wait for, and hope for deliverance still.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, by this time, Captain Credence was returned and come

<P>from the court from Emmanuel to the castle of Mansoul, and he

<P>returned to them with a packet.&nbsp; So my Lord Mayor, hearing

<P>that Captain Credence was come, withdrew himself from the

<P>noise of the roaring of the tyrant, and left him to yell at

<P>the wall of the town, or against the gates of the castle.&nbsp; So

<P>he came up to the captain's lodgings, and saluting him, he

<P>asked him of his welfare, and what was the best news at

<P>court.&nbsp; But when he asked Captain Credence that, the water

<P>stood in his eyes.&nbsp; Then said the captain, 'Cheer up, my

<P>lord, for all will be well in time.'&nbsp; And with that he first

<P>produced his packet, and laid it by; but that the Lord Mayor,

<P>and the rest of the captains, took for sign of good tidings.

<P>Now a season of grace being come, he sent for all the

<P>captains and elders of the town, that were here and there in

<P>their lodgings in the castle and upon their guard, to let

<P>them know that Captain Credence was returned from the court,

<P>and that he had something in general, and something in

<P>special, to communicate to them.&nbsp; So they all came up to him,

<P>and saluted him, and asked him concerning his journey, and

<P>what was the best news at the court.&nbsp; And he answered them as

<P>he had done the Lord Mayor before, that all would be well at

<P>last.&nbsp; Now, when the captain had thus saluted them, he opened

<P>his packet, and thence did draw out his several notes for

<P>those that he had sent for.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And the first note was for my Lord Mayor, wherein was

<P>signified:- That the Prince Emmanuel had taken it well that

<P>my Lord Mayor had been so true and trusty in his office, and

<P>the great concerns that lay upon him for the town and people

<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; Also, he bid him to know, that he took it well

<P>that he had been so bold for his Prince Emmanuel, and had

<P>engaged so faithfully in his cause against Diabolus.&nbsp; He also

<P>signified, at the close of his letter, that he should shortly

<P>receive his reward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The second note that came out, was for the noble Lord

<P>Willbewill, wherein there was signified:- That his Prince

<P>Emmanuel did well understand how valiant and courageous he

<P>had been for the honour of his Lord, now in his absence, and

<P>when his name was under contempt by Diabolus.&nbsp; There was

<P>signified also, that his Prince had taken it well that he had

<P>been so faithful to the town of Mansoul, in his keeping of so

<P>strict a hand and eye over and so strict a rein upon the neck

<P>of the Diabolonians, that did still lie lurking in their

<P>several holes in the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He signified,

<P>moreover, how that he understood that my Lord had, with his

<P>own hand, done great execution upon some of the chief of the

<P>rebels there, to the great discouragement of the adverse

<P>party and to the good example of the whole town of Mansoul;

<P>and that shortly his lordship should have his reward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The third note came out for the subordinate preacher, wherein

<P>was signified:- That his Prince took it well from him, that

<P>he had so honestly and so faithfully performed his office,

<P>and executed the trust committed to him by his Lord, while he

<P>exhorted, rebuked, and forewarned Mansoul according to the

<P>laws of the town.&nbsp; He signified, moreover, that he took it

<P>well at his hand that he called to fasting, to sackcloth, and

<P>ashes, when Mansoul was under her revolt.&nbsp; Also, that he

<P>called for the aid of the Captain Boanerges to help in so

<P>weighty a work; and that shortly he also should receive his

<P>reward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fourth note came out for Mr. Godly-Fear, wherein his Lord

<P>thus signified:- That his Lordship observed, that he was the

<P>first of all the men in Mansoul that detected Mr. Carnal-

<P>Security as the only one that, through his subtlety and

<P>cunning, had obtained for Diabolus a defection and decay of

<P>goodness in the blessed town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Moreover, his Lord

<P>gave him to understand, that he still remembered his tears

<P>and mourning for the state of Mansoul.&nbsp; It was also observed,

<P>by the same note, that his Lord took notice of his detecting

<P>of this Mr. Carnal-Security, at his own table among his

<P>guests, in his own house, and that in the midst of his

<P>jolliness, even while he was seeking to perfect his villanies

<P>against the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Emmanuel also took notice that

<P>this reverend person, Mr. Godly-Fear, stood stoutly to it, at

<P>the gates of the castle, against all the threats and attempts

<P>of the tyrant; and that he had put the townsmen in a way to

<P>make their petition to their Prince, so as that he might

<P>accept thereof, and as they might obtain an answer of peace;

<P>and that therefore shortly he should receive his reward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After all this, there was yet produced a note which was

<P>written to the whole town of Mansoul, whereby they perceived

<P>- That their Lord took notice of their so often repeating of

<P>petitions to him; and that they should see more of the fruits

<P>of such their doings in time to come.&nbsp; Their Prince did also

<P>therein tell them, that he took it well, that their heart and

<P>mind, now at last, abode fixed upon him and his ways, though

<P>Diabolus had made such inroads upon them; and that neither

<P>flatteries on the one hand, nor hardships on the other, could

<P>make them yield to serve his cruel designs.&nbsp; There was also

<P>inserted at the bottom of this note - That his Lordship had

<P>left the town of Mansoul in the hands of the Lord Secretary,

<P>and under the conduct of Captain Credence, saying, 'Beware

<P>that you yet yield yourselves unto their governance; and in

<P>due time you shall receive your reward.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, after the brave Captain Credence had delivered his notes

<P>to those to whom they belonged, he retired himself to my Lord

<P>Secretary's lodgings, and there spends time in conversing

<P>with him; for they too were very great one with another, and

<P>did indeed know more how things would go with Mansoul than

<P>did all the townsmen besides.&nbsp; The Lord Secretary also loved

<P>the Captain Credence dearly; yea, many a good bit was sent

<P>him from my Lord's table; also, he might have a show of

<P>countenance, when the rest of Mansoul lay under the clouds:

<P>so, after some time for converse was spent, the captain

<P>betook himself to his chambers to rest.&nbsp; But it was not long

<P>after when my Lord did send for the captain again; so the

<P>captain came to him, and they greeted one another with usual

<P>salutations.&nbsp; Then said the captain to the Lord Secretary,

<P>'What hath my Lord to say to his servant?'&nbsp; So the Lord

<P>Secretary took him and had him aside, and after a sign or two

<P>of more favour, he said, 'I have made thee the Lord's

<P>lieutenant over all the forces in Mansoul; so that, from this

<P>day forward, all men in Mansoul shall be at thy word; and

<P>thou shalt be he that shall lead in, and that shall lead out

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou shalt therefore manage, according to thy

<P>place, the war for thy Prince, and for the town of Mansoul,

<P>against the force and power of Diabolus; and at thy command

<P>shall the rest of the captains be.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now the townsmen began to perceive what interest the captain

<P>had, both with the court, and also with the Lord Secretary in

<P>Mansoul; for no man before could speed when sent, nor bring

<P>such good news from Emmanuel as he.&nbsp; Wherefore what do they,

<P>after some lamentation that they made no more use of him in

<P>their distresses, but send by their subordinate preacher to

<P>the Lord Secretary, to desire him that all that ever they

<P>were and had might be put under the government, care,

<P>custody, and conduct of Captain Credence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So their preacher went and did his errand, and received this

<P>answer from the mouth of his Lord: that Captain Credence

<P>should be the great doer in all the King's army, against the

<P>King's enemies, and also for the welfare of Mansoul.&nbsp; So he

<P>bowed to the ground, and thanked his Lordship, and returned

<P>and told his news to the townsfolk.&nbsp; But all this was done

<P>with all imaginable secrecy, because the foes had yet great

<P>strength in the town.&nbsp; But to return to our story again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus saw himself thus boldly confronted by the Lord

<P>Mayor, and perceived the stoutness of Mr. Godly-Fear, he fell

<P>into a rage, and forthwith called a council of war, that he

<P>might be revenged on Mansoul.&nbsp; So all the princes of the pit

<P>came together, and old Incredulity at the head of them, with

<P>all the captains of his army.&nbsp; So they consult what to do.

<P>Now the effect and conclusion of the council that day was how

<P>they might take the castle, because they could not conclude

<P>themselves masters of the town so long as that was in the

<P>possession of their enemies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So one advised this way, and another advised that; but when

<P>they could not agree in their verdict, Apollyon, that

<P>president of the council, stood up, and thus he began: 'My

<P>brotherhood,' quoth he, 'I have two things to propound unto

<P>you; and my first is this.&nbsp; Let us withdraw ourselves from

<P>the town into the plain again, for our presence here will do

<P>us no good, because the castle is yet in our enemies' hands;

<P>nor is it possible that we should take that, so long as so

<P>many brave captains are in it, and that this bold fellow,

<P>Godly-Fear, is made the keeper of the gates of it.&nbsp; Now, when

<P>we have withdrawn ourselves into the plain, they, of their

<P>own accord, will be glad of some little ease; and it may be,

<P>of their own accord, they again may begin to be remiss, and

<P>even their so being will give them a bigger blow than we can

<P>possibly give them ourselves.&nbsp; But if that should fail, our

<P>going forth of the town may draw the captains out after us;

<P>and you know what it cost them when we fought them in the

<P>field before.&nbsp; Besides, can we but draw them out into the

<P>field, we may lay an ambush behind the town, which shall,

<P>when they are come forth abroad, rush in and take possession

<P>of the castle.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Beelzebub stood up, and replied, saying: 'It is

<P>impossible to draw them all off from the castle; some, you

<P>may be sure, will lie there to keep that; wherefore it will

<P>be but in vain thus to attempt, unless we were sure that they

<P>will all come out.'&nbsp; He therefore concluded that what was

<P>done must be done by some other means.&nbsp; And the most likely

<P>means that the greatest of their heads could invent, was that

<P>which Apollyon had advised to before, namely, to get the

<P>townsmen again to sin.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'it is not our being

<P>in the town, nor in the field, nor our fighting, nor our

<P>killing of their men, that can make us the masters of

<P>Mansoul; for so long as one in the town is able to lift up

<P>his finger against us, Emmanuel will take their parts; and if

<P>he shall take their parts, we know what time of day it will

<P>be with us.&nbsp; Wherefore, for my part,' quoth he, 'there is, in

<P>my judgment, no way to bring them into bondage to us, like

<P>inventing a way to make them sin.&nbsp; Had we,' said he, 'left

<P>all our doubters at home, we had done as well as we have done

<P>now, unless we could have made them the masters and governors

<P>of the castle; for doubters at a distance are but like

<P>objections refelled with arguments.&nbsp; Indeed, can we but get

<P>them into the hold, and make them possessors of that, the day

<P>will be our own.&nbsp; Let us, therefore, withdraw ourselves into

<P>the plain, (not expecting that the captains in Mansoul should

<P>follow us,) but yet, I say, let us do this, and before we so

<P>do, let us advise again with our trusty Diabolonians that are

<P>yet in their holds of Mansoul, and set them to work to betray

<P>the town to us; for they indeed must do it, or it will be

<P>left undone for ever.'&nbsp; By these sayings of Beelzebub, (for I

<P>think it was he that gave this counsel,) the whole conclave

<P>was forced to be of his opinion, namely, that the way to get

<P>the castle was to get the town to sin.&nbsp; Then they fell to

<P>inventing by what means they might do this thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Lucifer stood up, and said: 'The counsel of Beelzebub is

<P>pertinent.&nbsp; Now, the way to bring this to pass, in mine

<P>opinion, is this: let us withdraw our force from the town of

<P>Mansoul; let us do this, and let us terrify them no more,

<P>either with summons, or threats, or with the noise of our

<P>drum, or any other awakening means.&nbsp; Only let us lie in the

<P>field at a distance, and be as if we regarded them not; for

<P>frights, I see, do but awaken them, and make them more stand

<P>to their arms.&nbsp; I have also another stratagem in my head: you

<P>know Mansoul is a market-town, and a town that delights in

<P>commerce; what, therefore, if some of our Diabolonians shall

<P>feign themselves far-country men, and shall go out and bring

<P>to the market of Mansoul some of our wares to sell; and what

<P>matter at what rates they sell their wares, though it be but

<P>for half the worth?&nbsp; Now, let those that thus shall trade in

<P>their market be those that are witty and true to us, and I

<P>will lay my crown to pawn it will do.&nbsp; There are two that are

<P>come to my thoughts already, that I think will be arch at

<P>this work, and they are Mr. Penny-wise-pound-foolish, and Mr.

<P>Get-i'the-hundred-and-lose-i'the-shire; nor is this man with

<P>the long name at all inferior to the other.&nbsp; What, also, if

<P>you join with them Mr. Sweet-world and Mr. Present-good; they

<P>are men that are civil and cunning, but our true friends and

<P>helpers.&nbsp; Let these, with as many more, engage in this

<P>business for us, and let Mansoul be taken up in much

<P>business, and let them grow full and rich, and this is the

<P>way to get ground of them.&nbsp; Remember ye not that thus we

<P>prevailed upon Laodicea, and how many at present do we hold

<P>in this snare?&nbsp; Now, when they begin to grow full, they will

<P>forget their misery; and if we shall not affright them, they

<P>may happen to fall asleep, and so be got to neglect their

<P>town watch, their castle watch, as well as their watch at the

<P>gates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yea, may we not, by this means, so cumber Mansoul with

<P>abundance, that they shall be forced to make of their castle

<P>a warehouse, instead of a garrison fortified against us, and

<P>a receptacle for men of war.&nbsp; Thus, if we get our goods and

<P>commodities thither, I reckon that the castle is more than

<P>half ours.&nbsp; Besides, could we so order it that it shall be

<P>filled with such kind of wares, then if we made a sudden

<P>assault upon them, it would be hard for the captains to take

<P>shelter there.&nbsp; Do you not know that of the parable, "The

<P>deceitfulness of riches choke the word"? and again, "When the

<P>heart is over-charged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and

<P>the cares of this life," all mischief comes upon them at

<P>unawares?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Furthermore, my lords,' quoth he, 'you very well know that

<P>it is not easy for a people to be filled with our things, and

<P>not to have some of our Diabolonians as retainers to their

<P>houses and services.&nbsp; Where is a Mansoulian that is full of

<P>this world, that has not for his servants and waiting-men,

<P>Mr. Profuse, or Mr. Prodigality, or some other of our

<P>Diabolonian gang, as Mr. Voluptuous, Mr. Pragmatical, Mr.

<P>Ostentation, or the like?&nbsp; Now these can take the castle of

<P>Mansoul, or blow it up, or make it unfit for a garrison for

<P>Emmanuel, and any of these will do.&nbsp; Yea, these, for aught I

<P>know, may do it for us sooner than an army of twenty thousand

<P>men.&nbsp; Wherefore, to end as I began, my advice is, that we

<P>quietly withdraw ourselves, not offering any further force,

<P>or forcible attempts, upon the castle, at least at this time;

<P>and let us set on foot our new project, and let us see if

<P>that will not make them destroy themselves.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This advice was highly applauded by them all, and was

<P>accounted the very masterpiece of hell, namely, to choke

<P>Mansoul with a fulness of this world, and to surfeit her

<P>heart with the good things thereof.&nbsp; But see how things meet

<P>together!&nbsp; Just as this Diabolonian council was broken up,

<P>Captain Credence received a letter from Emmanuel, the

<P>contents of which were these: That upon the third day he

<P>would meet him in the field in the plains about Mansoul.

<P>'Meet me in the field!' quoth the Captain; 'what meaneth my

<P>lord by this?&nbsp; I know not what he meaneth by meeting me in

<P>the field.'&nbsp; So he took the note in his hand, and did carry

<P>it to my Lord Secretary, to ask his thoughts thereupon; for

<P>my Lord was a seer in all matters concerning the King, and

<P>also for the good and comfort of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; So he

<P>showed my Lord the note, and desired his opinion thereof.

<P>'For my part,' quoth Captain Credence, 'I know not the

<P>meaning thereof.'&nbsp; So my lord did take and read it and, after

<P>a little pause, he said, 'The Diabolonians have had against

<P>Mansoul a great consultation to-day; they have, I say, this

<P>day been contriving the utter ruin of the town; and the

<P>result of their council is, to set Mansoul into such a way

<P>which, if taken, will surely make her destroy herself.&nbsp; And,

<P>to this end, they are making ready for their own departure

<P>out of the town, intending to betake themselves to the field

<P>again,' and there to lie till they shall see whether this

<P>their project will take or no.&nbsp; But be thou ready with the

<P>men of thy Lord, (for on the third day they will be in the

<P>plain,) there to fall upon the Diabolonians; for the Prince

<P>will by that time be in the field; yea, by that it is break

<P>of day, sun-rising, or before, and that with a mighty force

<P>against them.&nbsp; So he shall be before them, and thou shalt be

<P>behind them, and betwixt you both their army shall be

<P>destroyed.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Captain Credence heard this, away goes he to the rest of

<P>the captains, and tells them what a note he had a while since

<P>received from the hand of Emmanuel.&nbsp; 'And,' said he, 'that

<P>which was dark therein hath my lord the Lord Secretary

<P>expounded unto me.'&nbsp; He told them, moreover, what by himself

<P>and by them must be done to answer the mind of their Lord.

<P>Then were the captains glad; and Captain Credence commanded

<P>that all the King's trumpeters should ascend to the

<P>battlements of the castle, and there, in the audience of

<P>Diabolus and of the whole town of Mansoul, make the best

<P>music that heart could invent.&nbsp; The trumpeters then did as

<P>they were commanded.&nbsp; They got themselves up to the top of

<P>the castle, and thus they began to sound.&nbsp; Then did Diabolus

<P>start, and said, 'What can be the meaning of this? they

<P>neither sound Boot-and-saddle, nor Horse-and-away, nor a

<P>charge.&nbsp; What do these madmen mean that yet they should be so

<P>merry and glad?'&nbsp; Then answered one of themselves and said,

<P>'This is for joy that their Prince Emmanuel is coming to

<P>relieve the town of Mansoul; and to this end he is at the

<P>head of an army, and that this relief is near.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men of Mansoul also were greatly concerned at this

<P>melodious charm of the trumpets; they said, yea, they

<P>answered one another, saying, 'This can be no harm to us;

<P>surely this can be no harm to us.'&nbsp; Then said the

<P>Diabolonians, 'What had we best to do?' and it was answered,

<P>'It was best to quit the town;' and 'that,' said one, 'ye may

<P>do in pursuance of your last counsel, and by so doing also be

<P>better able to give the enemy battle, should an army from

<P>without come upon us.&nbsp; So, on the second day, they withdrew

<P>themselves from Mansoul, and abode in the plains without; but

<P>they encamped themselves before Eye-gate, in what terrene and

<P>terrible manner they could.&nbsp; The reason why they would not

<P>abide in the town (besides the reasons that were debated in

<P>their late conclave) was, for that they were not possessed of

<P>the stronghold, and 'because,' said they, 'we shall have more

<P>convenience to fight, and also to fly, if need be, when we

<P>are encamped in the open plains.'&nbsp; Besides, the town would

<P>have been a pit for them rather than a place of defence, had

<P>the Prince come up and inclosed them fast therein.&nbsp; Therefore

<P>they betook themselves to the field, that they might also be

<P>out of the reach of the slings, by which they were much

<P>annoyed all the while that they were in the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, the time that the captains were to fall upon the

<P>Diabolonians being come, they eagerly prepared themselves for

<P>action; for Captain Credence had told the captains over

<P>night, that they should meet their Prince in the field to-

<P>morrow.&nbsp; This, therefore, made them yet far more desirous to

<P>be engaging the enemy; for 'You shall see the Prince in the

<P>field to-morrow' was like oil to a flaming fire, for of a

<P>long time they had been at a distance: they therefore were

<P>for this the more earnest and desirous of the work.&nbsp; So, as I

<P>said, the hour being come, Captain Credence, with the rest of

<P>the men of war, drew out their forces before it was day by

<P>the sally-port of the town.&nbsp; And, being all ready, Captain

<P>Credence went up to the head of the army, and gave to the

<P>rest of the captains the word, and so they to their under-

<P>officers and soldiers: the word was 'The sword of the Prince

<P>Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence;' which is, in

<P>the Mansoulian tongue, 'The word of God and faith.'&nbsp; Then the

<P>captains fell on, and began roundly to front, and flank, and

<P>rear Diabolus's camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, they left Captain Experience in the town, because he was

<P>yet ill of his wounds, which the Diabolonians had given him

<P>in the last fight.&nbsp; But when he perceived that the captains

<P>were at it, what does he but, calling for his crutches with

<P>haste, gets up, and away he goes to the battle, saying,

<P>'Shall I lie here, when my brethren are in the fight, and

<P>when Emmanuel, the Prince, will show himself in the field to

<P>his servants?'&nbsp; But when the enemy saw the man come with his

<P>crutches, they were daunted yet the more; 'for,' thought

<P>they, 'what spirit has possessed these Mansoulians, that they

<P>fight us upon their crutches?'&nbsp; Well, the captains, as I

<P>said, fell on, and did bravely handle their weapons, still

<P>crying out and shouting, as they laid on blows, 'The sword of

<P>the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when Diabolus saw that the captains were come out, and

<P>that so valiantly they surrounded his men, he concluded that,

<P>for the present, nothing from them was to be looked for but

<P>blows, and the dints of their 'two-edged sword.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore he also falls on upon the Prince's army with all

<P>his deadly force: so the battle was joined.&nbsp; Now who was it

<P>that at first Diabolus met with in the fight, but Captain

<P>Credence on the one hand, and the Lord Willbewill on the

<P>other: now Willbewill's blows were like the blows of a giant,

<P>for that man had a strong arm, and he fell in upon the

<P>election doubters, for they were the life-guard of Diabolus,

<P>and he kept them in play a good while, cutting and battering

<P>shrewdly.&nbsp; Now when Captain Credence saw my lord engaged, he

<P>did stoutly fall on, on the other hand, upon the same company

<P>also; so they put them to great disorder.&nbsp; Now Captain Good-

<P>Hope had engaged the vocation doubters, and they were sturdy

<P>men; but the captain was a valiant man: Captain Experience

<P>did also send him some aid; so he made the vocation doubters

<P>to retreat.&nbsp; The rest of the armies were hotly engaged, and

<P>that on every side, and the Diabolonians did fight stoutly.

<P>Then did my Lord Secretary command that the slings from the

<P>castle should be played; and his men could throw stones at an

<P>hair's breadth.&nbsp; But, after a while, those that were made to

<P>fly before the captains of the Prince, did begin to rally

<P>again, and they came up stoutly upon the rear of the Prince's

<P>army: wherefore the Prince's army began to faint; but,

<P>remembering that they should see the face of their Prince by-

<P>and-by, they took courage, and a very fierce battle was

<P>fought.&nbsp; Then shouted the captains, saying, 'The sword of the

<P>Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!' and

<P>with that Diabolus gave back, thinking that more aid had been

<P>come.&nbsp; But no Emmanuel as yet appeared.&nbsp; Moreover, the battle

<P>did hang in doubt; and they made a little retreat on both

<P>sides.&nbsp; Now, in the time of respite, Captain Credence bravely

<P>encouraged his men to stand to it; and Diabolus did the like,

<P>as well as he could.&nbsp; But Captain Credence made a brave

<P>speech to his soldiers, the contents whereof here follow:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen soldiers, and my brethren in this design, it

<P>rejoiceth me much to see in the field for our Prince, this

<P>day, so stout and so valiant an army, and such faithful

<P>lovers of Mansoul.&nbsp; You have hitherto, as hath become you,

<P>shown yourselves men of truth and courage against the

<P>Diabolonian forces; so that, for all their boast, they have

<P>not yet much cause to boast of their gettings.&nbsp; Now take to

<P>yourselves your wonted courage, and show yourselves men even

<P>this once only; for in a few minutes after the next

<P>engagement, this time, you shall see your Prince show himself

<P>in the field; for we must make this second assault upon this

<P>tyrant Diabolus, and then Emmanuel comes.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No sooner had the captain made this speech to his soldiers,

<P>but one Mr. Speedy came post to the captain from the Prince,

<P>to tell him that Emmanuel was at hand.&nbsp; This news when the

<P>captain had received, he communicated to the other field-

<P>officers, and they again to their soldiers and men of war.

<P>Wherefore, like men raised from the dead, so the captains and

<P>their men arose, made up to the enemy, and cried as before,

<P>'The sword of the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain

<P>Credence!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Diabolonians also bestirred themselves, and made

<P>resistance as well as they could; but in this last engagement

<P>the Diabolonians lost their courage, and many of the doubters

<P>fell down dead to the ground.&nbsp; Now, when they had been in

<P>heat of battle about an hour or more, Captain Credence lift

<P>up his eyes and saw, and, behold, Emmanuel came; and he came

<P>with colours flying, trumpets sounding, and the feet of his

<P>men scarce touched the ground, they hasted with that celerity

<P>towards the captains that were engaged.&nbsp; Then did Credence

<P>wind with his men to the townward, and gave to Diabolus the

<P>field: so Emmanuel came upon him on the one side, and the

<P>enemies' place was betwixt them both.&nbsp; Then again they fell

<P>to it afresh; and now it was but a little while more but

<P>Emmanuel and Captain Credence met, still trampling down the

<P>slain as they came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when the captains saw that the Prince was come, and that

<P>he fell upon the Diabolonians on the other side, and that

<P>Captain Credence and his Highness had got them up betwixt

<P>them, they shouted, (they so shouted that the ground rent

<P>again,) saying, 'The sword of Emmanuel, and the shield of

<P>Captain Credence!'&nbsp; Now, when Diabolus saw that he and his

<P>forces were so hard beset by the Prince and his princely

<P>army, what does he, and the lords of the pit that were with

<P>him, but make their escape, and forsake their army, and leave

<P>them to fall by the hand of Emmanuel, and of his noble

<P>Captain Credence: so they fell all down slain before them,

<P>before the Prince, and before his royal army; there was not

<P>left so much as one doubter alive; they lay spread upon the

<P>ground dead men, as one would spread dung upon the land.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the battle was over, all things came into order in the

<P>camp.&nbsp; Then the captains and elders of Mansoul came together

<P>to salute Emmanuel, while without the corporation: so they

<P>saluted him, and welcomed him, and that with a thousand

<P>welcomes, for that he was come to the borders of Mansoul

<P>again.&nbsp; So he smiled upon them, and said, 'Peace be to you.'

<P>Then they addressed themselves to go to the town; they went

<P>then to go up to Mansoul, they, the Prince, with all the new

<P>forces that now he had brought with him to the war.&nbsp; Also all

<P>the gates of the town were set open for his reception, so

<P>glad were they of his blessed return.&nbsp; And this was the

<P>manner and order of this going of his into Mansoul:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First.&nbsp; As I said, all the gates of the town were set open,

<P>yea, the gates of the castle also; the elders, too, of the

<P>town of Mansoul placed themselves at the gates of the town,

<P>to salute him at his entrance thither: and so they did; for,

<P>as he drew near, and approached towards the gates, they said,

<P>'Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye

<P>everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.'&nbsp; And

<P>they answered again, 'Who is the King of glory?' and they

<P>made return to themselves, 'The Lord, strong and mighty; the

<P>Lord mighty in battle.&nbsp; Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even

<P>lift them up, ye everlasting doors,' etc.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Secondly.&nbsp; It was ordered also, by those of Mansoul, that all

<P>the way from the town gates to those of the castle, his

<P>blessed Majesty should be entertained with the song, by them

<P>that had the best skill in music in all the town of Mansoul:

<P>then did the elders, and the rest of the men of Mansoul,

<P>answer one another as Emmanuel entered the town, till he came

<P>at the castle gates, with songs and sound of trumpets,

<P>saying, 'They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of

<P>my God, my King, in the sanctuary.&nbsp; So the singers went

<P>before, the players on instruments followed after, and among

<P>them were the damsels playing on timbrels.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thirdly.&nbsp; Then the captains, (for I would speak a word of

<P>them,) they in their order waited on the Prince, as he

<P>entered into the gates of Mansoul.&nbsp; Captain Credence went

<P>before, and Captain Good-Hope with him; Captain Charity came

<P>behind with other of his companions, and Captain Patience

<P>followed after all; and the rest of the captains, some on the

<P>right hand, and some on the left, accompanied Emmanuel into

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; And all the while the colours were displayed, the

<P>trumpets sounded, and continual shoutings were among the

<P>soldiers.&nbsp; The Prince himself rode into the town in his

<P>armour, which was all of beaten gold, and in his chariot -

<P>the pillars of it were of silver, the bottom thereof of gold,

<P>the covering of it was of purple, the midst thereof being

<P>paved with love for the daughters of the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fourthly.&nbsp; When the Prince was come to the entrance of

<P>Mansoul, he found all the streets strewed with lilies and

<P>flowers, curiously decked with boughs and branches from the

<P>green trees that stood round about the town.&nbsp; Every door also

<P>was filled with persons, who had adorned every one their

<P>fore-part against their house with something of variety and

<P>singular excellency, to entertain him withal as he passed in

<P>the streets: they also themselves, as Emmanuel passed by, did

<P>welcome him with shouts and acclamations of joy, saying,

<P>'Blessed be the Prince that cometh in the name of his Father

<P>Shaddai.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fifthly.&nbsp; At the castle gates the elders of Mansoul, namely,

<P>the Lord Mayor, the Lord Willbewill, the subordinate

<P>preacher, Mr. Knowledge, and Mr. Mind, with other of the

<P>gentry of the place, saluted Emmanuel again.&nbsp; They bowed

<P>before him, they kissed the dust of his feet, they thanked,

<P>they blessed, and praised his Highness for not taking

<P>advantage against them for their sins, but rather had pity

<P>upon them in their misery, and returned to them with mercies,

<P>and to build up their Mansoul for ever.&nbsp; Thus was he had up

<P>straightway to the castle; for that was the royal palace, and

<P>the place where his honour was to dwell; the which was ready

<P>prepared for his Highness by the presence of the Lord

<P>Secretary, and the work of Captain Credence.&nbsp; So he entered

<P>in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sixthly.&nbsp; Then the people and commonalty of the town of

<P>Mansoul came to him into the castle to mourn, and to weep,

<P>and to lament for their wickedness, by which they had forced

<P>him out of the town.&nbsp; So when they were come, bowed

<P>themselves to the ground seven times; they also wept, they

<P>wept aloud, and asked forgiveness of the Prince, and prayed

<P>that he would again, as of old, confirm his love to Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the which the great Prince replied, 'Weep not, but go your

<P>way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to

<P>them for whom nought is prepared; for the joy of your Lord is

<P>your strength.&nbsp; I am returned to Mansoul with mercies, and my

<P>name shall be set up, exalted, and magnified by it.'&nbsp; He also

<P>took these inhabitants, and kissed them, and laid them in his

<P>bosom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Moreover, he gave to the elders of Mansoul, and to each town

<P>officer, a chain of gold and a signet.&nbsp; He also sent to their

<P>wives earrings and jewels, and bracelets, and other things.

<P>He also bestowed upon the true-born children of Mansoul many

<P>precious things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Emmanuel, the Prince, had done all these things for the

<P>famous town of Mansoul, then he said unto them, first, 'Wash

<P>your garments, then put on your ornaments, and then come to

<P>me into the castle of Mansoul.'&nbsp; So they went to the fountain

<P>that was set open for Judah and Jerusalem to wash in; and

<P>there they washed, and there they made their 'garments

<P>white,' and came again to the Prince into the castle, and

<P>thus they stood before him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now there was music and dancing throughout the whole town

<P>of Mansoul, and that because their Prince had again granted

<P>to them his presence and the light of his countenance; the

<P>bells also did ring, and the sun shone comfortably upon them

<P>for a great while together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The town of Mansoul did also now more thoroughly seek the

<P>destruction and ruin of all remaining Diabolonians that abode

<P>in the walls, and the dens that they had in the town of

<P>Mansoul; for there was of them that had, to this day, escaped

<P>with life and limb from the hand of their suppressors in the

<P>famous town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But my Lord Willbewill was a greater terror to them now than

<P>ever he had been before; forasmuch as his heart was yet more

<P>fully bent to seek, contrive, and pursue them to the death;

<P>he pursued them night and day, and did put them now to sore

<P>distress, as will afterwards appear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After things were thus far put into order in the famous town

<P>of Mansoul, care was taken, and order given by the blessed

<P>Prince Emmanuel, that the townsmen should, without further

<P>delay, appoint some to go forth into the plain to bury the

<P>dead that were there, - the dead that fell by the sword of

<P>Emmanuel, and by the shield of the Captain Credence, - lest

<P>the fumes and ill savours that would arise from them might

<P>infect the air, and so annoy the famous town of Mansoul.

<P>This also was a reason of this order, namely, that, as much

<P>as in Mansoul lay, they might cut off the name, and being,

<P>and remembrance of those enemies from the thought of the

<P>famous town of Mansoul and its inhabitants.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So order was given out by the Lord Mayor, that wise and

<P>trusty friend of the town of Mansoul, that persons should be

<P>employed about this necessary business; and Mr. Godly-Fear,

<P>and one Mr. Upright, were to be overseers about this matter:

<P>so persons were put under them to work in the fields, and to

<P>bury the slain that lay dead in the plains.&nbsp; And these were

<P>their places of employment: some were to make the graves,

<P>some to bury the dead, and some were to go to and fro in the

<P>plains, and also round about the borders of Mansoul, to see

<P>if a skull, or a bone, or a piece of a bone of a doubter, was

<P>yet to be found above ground anywhere near the corporation;

<P>and if any were found, it was ordered, that the searchers

<P>that searched should set up a mark thereby, and a sign, that

<P>those that were appointed to bury them might find it, and

<P>bury it out of sight, that the name and remembrance of a

<P>Diabolonian doubter might be blotted out from under heaven;

<P>and that the children, and they that were to be born in

<P>Mansoul, might not know, if possible, what a skull, what a

<P>bone, or a piece of a bone of a doubter was.&nbsp; So the buriers,

<P>and those that were appointed for that purpose, did as they

<P>were commanded: they buried the doubters, and all the skulls

<P>and bones, and pieces of bones of doubters, wherever they

<P>found them; and so they cleansed the plains.&nbsp; Now also Mr.

<P>God's-Peace took up his commission, and acted again as in

<P>former days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus they buried in the plains about Mansoul the election

<P>doubters, the vocation doubters, the grace doubters, the

<P>perseverance doubters, the resurrection doubters, the

<P>salvation doubters, and the glory doubters; whose captains

<P>were Captain Rage, Captain Cruel, Captain Damnation, Captain

<P>Insatiable, Captain Brimstone, Captain Torment, Captain No-

<P>Ease, Captain Sepulchre, and Captain Past-Hope; and old

<P>Incredulity was, under Diabolus, their general.&nbsp; There were

<P>also the seven heads of their army; and they were the Lord

<P>Beelzebub, the Lord Lucifer, the Lord Legion, the Lord

<P>Apollyon, the Lord Python, the Lord Cerberus, and the Lord

<P>Belial.&nbsp; But the princes and the captains, with old

<P>Incredulity, their general, did all of them make their

<P>escape: so their men fell down slain by the power of the

<P>Prince's forces, and by the hands of the men of the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; They also were buried as is afore related, to the

<P>exceeding great joy of the now famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; They

<P>that buried them buried also with them their arms, which were

<P>cruel instruments of death: (their weapons were arrows,

<P>darts, mauls, firebrands, and the like).&nbsp; They buried also

<P>their armour, their colours, banners, with the standard of

<P>Diabolus, and what else soever they could find that did but

<P>smell of a Diabolonian doubter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when the tyrant had arrived at Hell-Gate Hill, with his

<P>old friend Incredulity, they immediately descended the den,

<P>and having there with their fellows for a while condoled

<P>their misfortune and great loss that they sustained against

<P>the town of Mansoul, they fell at length into a passion, and

<P>revenged they would be for the loss that they sustained

<P>before the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore they presently call a

<P>council to contrive yet further what was to be done against

<P>the famous town of Mansoul; for their yawning paunches could

<P>not wait to see the result of their Lord Lucifer's and their

<P>Lord Apollyon's counsel that they had given before; for their

<P>raging gorge thought every day, even as long as a short for

<P>ever, until they were filled with the body and soul, with the

<P>flesh and bones, and with all the delicates of Mansoul.&nbsp; They

<P>therefore resolve to make another attempt upon the town of

<P>Mansoul, and that by an army mixed and made up partly of

<P>doubters, and partly of blood-men.&nbsp; A more particular account

<P>now take of both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The doubters are such as have their name from their nature,

<P>as well as from the land and kingdom where they are born:

<P>their nature is to put a question upon every one of the

<P>truths of Emmanuel; and their country is called the land of

<P>Doubting, and that land lieth off, and farthest remote to the

<P>north, between the land of Darkness and that called the

<P>'valley of the shadow of death.'&nbsp; For though the land of

<P>Darkness, and that called 'the valley of the shadow of

<P>death,' be sometimes called as if they were one and the self-

<P>same place, yet indeed they are two, lying but a little way

<P>asunder, and the land of Doubting points in, and lieth

<P>between them.&nbsp; This is the land of Doubting; and these that

<P>came with Diabolus to ruin the town of Mansoul are the

<P>natives of that country.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blood-men are a people that have their name derived from

<P>the malignity of their nature, and from the fury that is in

<P>them to execute it upon the town of Mansoul: their land lieth

<P>under the dog-star, and by that they are governed as to their

<P>intellectuals.&nbsp; The name of their country is the province of

<P>Loath-good: the remote parts of it are far distant from the

<P>land of Doubting, yet they do both butt and bound upon the

<P>hill called Hell-Gate Hill.&nbsp; These people are always in

<P>league with the doubters, for they jointly do make question

<P>of the faith and fidelity of the men of the town of Mansoul,

<P>and so are both alike qualified for the service of their

<P>prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now of these two countries did Diabolus, by the beating of

<P>his drum, raise another army against the town of Mansoul, of

<P>five-and-twenty thousand strong.&nbsp; There were ten thousand

<P>doubters, and fifteen thousand blood-men, and they were put

<P>under several captains for the war; and old Incredulity was

<P>again made general of the army.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for the doubters, their captains were five of the seven

<P>that were heads of the last Diabolonian army, and these are

<P>their names: Captain Beelzebub, Captain Lucifer, Captain

<P>Apollyon, Captain Legion, and Captain Cerberus; and the

<P>captains that they had before were some of them made

<P>lieutenants, and some ensigns of the army.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Diabolus did not count that, in this expedition of his,

<P>these doubters would prove his principal men, for their

<P>manhood had been tried before; also the Mansoulians had put

<P>them to the worst: only he did bring them to multiply a

<P>number, and to help, if need was, at a pinch.&nbsp; But his trust

<P>he put in his blood-men, for that they were all rugged

<P>villains, and he knew that they had done feats heretofore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for the blood-men, they also were under command and the

<P>names of their captains were, Captain Cain, Captain Nimrod,

<P>Captain Ishmael, Captain Esau, Captain Saul, Captain Absalom,

<P>Captain Judas, and Captain Pope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. Captain Cain was over two bands, namely, the zealous and

<P>the angry blood-men: his standard-bearer bare the red

<P>colours, and his scutcheon was the murdering club.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. Captain Nimrod was captain over two bands, namely, the

<P>tyrannical and encroaching blood-men: his standard-bearer

<P>bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was the great

<P>bloodhound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. Captain Ishmael was captain over two bands, namely, the

<P>mocking and scorning blood-men: his standard-bearer bare the

<P>red colours, and his scutcheon was one mocking at Abraham's

<P>Isaac.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. Captain Esau was captain over two bands, namely, the

<P>blood-men that grudged that another should have the blessing;

<P>also over the blood-men that are for executing their private

<P>revenge upon others: his standard-bearer bare the red

<P>colours, and his scutcheon was one privately lurking to

<P>murder Jacob.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>5. Captain Saul was captain over two bands, namely, the

<P>groundlessly jealous and the devilishly furious blood-men:

<P>his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and his scutcheon

<P>was three bloody darts cast at harmless David.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>6. Captain Absalom was captain over two bands, namely, over

<P>the blood-men that will kill a father or a friend for the

<P>glory of this world; also over those blood-men that will hold

<P>one fair in hand with words, till they shall have pierced him

<P>with their swords: his standard-bearer did bear the red

<P>colours, and his scutcheon was the son pursuing the father's

<P>blood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>7. Captain Judas was over two bands, namely, the blood-men

<P>that will sell a man's life for money, and those also that

<P>will betray their friend with a kiss: his standard-bearer

<P>bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was thirty pieces of

<P>silver and the halter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>8. Captain Pope was captain over one band, for all these

<P>spirits are joined in one under him: his standard-bearer bare

<P>the red colours, and his scutcheon was the stake, the flame,

<P>and the good man in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the reason why Diabolus did so soon rally another force,

<P>after he had been beaten out of the field, was, for that he

<P>put mighty confidence in this army of blood-men; for he put a

<P>great deal of more trust in them than he did before in his

<P>army of doubters; though they had also often done great

<P>service for him in the strengthening of him in his kingdom.

<P>But these blood-men, he had proved them often, and their

<P>sword did seldom return empty.&nbsp; Besides, he knew that these,

<P>like mastiffs, would fasten upon any; upon father, mother,

<P>brother, sister, prince, or governor, yea upon the Prince of

<P>princes.&nbsp; And that which encouraged him the more was, for

<P>that they once did force Emmanuel out of the kingdom of

<P>Universe; 'And why,' thought he, 'may they not also drive him

<P>from the town of Mansoul?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So this army of five-and-twenty thousand strong was, by their

<P>general, the great Lord Incredulity, led up against the town

<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now Mr. Prywell, the scoutmaster-general, did

<P>himself go out to spy, and he did bring Mansoul tidings of

<P>their coming.&nbsp; Wherefore they shut up their gates, and put

<P>themselves in a posture of defence against these new

<P>Diabolonians that came up against the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Diabolus brought up his army, and beleaguered the town of

<P>Mansoul; the doubters were placed about Feel-gate, and the

<P>blood-men set down before Eye-gate and Ear-gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when this army had thus encamped themselves, Incredulity

<P>did, in the name of Diabolus, his own name, and in the name

<P>of the blood-men and the rest that were with him, send a

<P>summons as hot as a red-hot iron to Mansoul, to yield to

<P>their demands; threatening, that if they still stood it out

<P>against them, they would presently burn down Mansoul with

<P>fire.&nbsp; For you must know that, as for the blood-men, they

<P>were not so much that Mansoul should be surrendered, as that

<P>Mansoul should be destroyed, and cut off out of the land of

<P>the living.&nbsp; True, they send to them to surrender; but should

<P>they so do, that would not stench or quench the thirsts of

<P>these men.&nbsp; They must have blood, the blood of Mansoul, else

<P>they die; and it is from hence that they have their name.

<P>Wherefore these blood-men he reserved while now that they

<P>might, when all his engines proved ineffectual, as his last

<P>and sure card be played against the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the townsmen had received this red-hot summons, it

<P>begat in them at present some changing and interchanging

<P>thoughts; but they jointly agreed, in less than half an hour,

<P>to carry the summons to the Prince, the which they did when

<P>they had writ at the bottom of it, 'Lord, save Mansoul from

<P>bloody men!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he took it, and looked upon it, and considered it, and

<P>took notice also of that short petition that the men of

<P>Mansoul had written at the bottom of it, and called to him

<P>the noble Captain Credence, and bid him go and take Captain

<P>Patience with him, and go and take care of that side of

<P>Mansoul that was beleaguered by the blood-men.&nbsp; So they went

<P>and did as they were commanded: the Captain Credence went and

<P>took Captain Patience, and they both secured that side of

<P>Mansoul that was besieged by the blood-men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he commanded that Captain Good-hope and Captain Charity,

<P>and my Lord Willbewill, should take charge of the other side

<P>of the town.&nbsp; 'And I,' said the Prince, 'will set my standard

<P>upon the battlements of your castle, and do you three watch

<P>against the doubters.'&nbsp; This done, he again commanded that

<P>the brave captain, the Captain Experience, should draw up his

<P>men in the market-place, and that there he should exercise

<P>them day by day before the people of the town of Mansoul.

<P>Now this siege was long, and many a fierce attempt did the

<P>enemy, especially those called the blood-men, make upon the

<P>town of Mansoul; and many a shrewd brush did some of the

<P>townsmen meet with from them, especially Captain Self-Denial,

<P>who, I should have told you before, was commanded to take the

<P>care of Ear-gate and Eye-gate now against the blood-men.

<P>This Captain Self-Denial was a young man, but stout, and a

<P>townsman in Mansoul, as Captain Experience also was.&nbsp; And

<P>Emmanuel, at his second return to Mansoul, made him a captain

<P>over a thousand of the Mansoulians, for the good of the

<P>corporation.&nbsp; This captain, therefore, being an hardy man,

<P>and a man of great courage, and willing to venture himself

<P>for the good of the town of Mansoul, would now and then sally

<P>out upon the blood-men, and give them many notable alarms,

<P>and entered several brisk skirmishes with them, and also did

<P>some execution upon them; but you must think that this could

<P>not easily be done, but he must meet with brushes himself,

<P>for he carried several of their marks in his face; yea, and

<P>some in some other parts of his body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, after some time spent for the trial of the faith, and

<P>hope, and love of the town of Mansoul, the Prince Emmanuel

<P>upon a day calls his captains and men of war together, and

<P>divides them into two companies; this done, he commands them

<P>at a time appointed, and that in the morning very early, to

<P>sally out upon the enemy, saying: 'Let half of you fall upon

<P>the doubters, and half of you fall upon the blood-men.&nbsp; Those

<P>of you that go out against the doubters, kill and slay, and

<P>cause to perish so many of them as by any means you can lay

<P>hands on; but for you that go out against the blood-men, slay

<P>them not, but take them alive.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, at the time appointed, betimes in the morning, the

<P>captains went out as they were commanded, against the

<P>enemies.&nbsp; Captain Good-Hope, Captain Charity, and those that

<P>were joined with them, as Captain Innocent and Captain

<P>Experience, went out against the doubters; and Captain

<P>Credence, and Captain Patience, with Captain Self-Denial, and

<P>the rest that were to join with them, went out against the

<P>blood-men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, those that went out against the doubters drew up into a

<P>body before the plain, and marched on to bid them battle.

<P>But the doubters, remembering their last success, made a

<P>retreat, not daring to stand the shock, but fled from the

<P>Prince's men; wherefore they pursued them, and in their

<P>pursuit slew many, but they could not catch them all.&nbsp; Now

<P>those that escaped went some of them home; and the rest by

<P>fives, nines, and seventeens, like wanderers, went straggling

<P>up and down the country, where they upon the barbarous people

<P>showed and exercised many of their Diabolonian actions: nor

<P>did these people rise up in arms against them, but suffered

<P>themselves to be enslaved by them.&nbsp; They would also after

<P>this show themselves in companies before the town of Mansoul,

<P>but never to abide in it; for if Captain Credence, Captain

<P>Good-Hope, or Captain Experience did but show themselves,

<P>they fled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Those that went out against the blood-men did as they were

<P>commanded: they forbore to slay any, but sought to compass

<P>them about.&nbsp; But the blood-men, when they saw that no

<P>Emmanuel was in the field, concluded also that no Emmanuel

<P>was in Mansoul; wherefore they, looking upon what the

<P>captains did to be, as they called it, a fruit of the

<P>extravagancy of their wild and foolish fancies, rather

<P>despised them than feared them.&nbsp; But the captains, minding

<P>their business, at last did compass them round; they also

<P>that had routed the doubters came in amain to their aid: so,

<P>in fine, after some little struggling, (for the blood-men

<P>also would have run for it, only now it was too late; for

<P>though they are mischievous and cruel, where they can

<P>overcome, yet all blood-men are chicken-hearted men, when

<P>they once come to see themselves matched and equalled,) - so

<P>the captains took them, and brought them to the Prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when they were taken, had before the Prince, and

<P>examined, he found them to be of three several counties,

<P>though they all came out of one land.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. One sort of them came out of Blind-man-shire, and they

<P>were such as did ignorantly what they did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. Another sort of them came out of Blind-zeal-shire, and

<P>they did superstitiously what they did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. The third sort of them came out of the town of Malice, in

<P>the county of Envy, and they did what they did out of spite

<P>and implacableness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the first of these, namely, they that came out of Blind-

<P>man-shire, when they saw where they were, and against whom

<P>they had fought, they trembled and cried, as they stood

<P>before him; and as many of these as asked him mercy, he

<P>touched their lips with his golden sceptre.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They that came out of Blind-zeal-shire, they did not as their

<P>fellows did; for they pleaded that they had a right to do

<P>what they did, because Mansoul was a town whose laws and

<P>customs were diverse from all that dwelt thereabouts.&nbsp; Very

<P>few of these could be brought to see their evil; but those

<P>that did, and asked mercy, they also obtained favour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, they that came out of the town of Malice, that is in the

<P>county of Envy, they neither wept, nor disputed, nor

<P>repented, but stood gnawing their tongues before him for

<P>anguish and madness, because they could not have their will

<P>upon Mansoul.&nbsp; Now these last, with all those of the other

<P>two sorts that did not unfeignedly ask pardon for their

<P>faults, - those he made to enter into sufficient bond to

<P>answer for what they had done against Mansoul, and against

<P>her King, at the great and general assizes to be holden for

<P>our Lord the King, where he himself should appoint for the

<P>country and kingdom of Universe.&nbsp; So they became bound each

<P>man for himself, to come in, when called upon, to answer

<P>before our Lord the King for what they had done as before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And thus much concerning this second army that was sent by

<P>Diabolus to overthrow Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But there were three of those that came from the land of

<P>Doubting, who, after they had wandered and ranged the country

<P>a while, and perceived that they had escaped, were so hardy

<P>as to thrust themselves, knowing that yet there were in the

<P>town Diabolonians, - I say, they were so hardy as to thrust

<P>themselves into Mansoul among them.&nbsp; (Three, did I say?&nbsp; I

<P>think there were four.)&nbsp; Now, to whose house should these

<P>Diabolonian doubters go, but to the house of an old

<P>Diabolonian in Mansoul, whose name was Evil-Questioning, a

<P>very great enemy he was to Mansoul, and a great doer among

<P>the Diabolonians there.&nbsp; Well, to this Evil-Questioning's

<P>house, as was said, did these Diabolonians come (you may be

<P>sure that they had directions how to find the way thither),

<P>so he made them welcome, pitied their misfortune, and

<P>succoured them with the best that he had in his house.&nbsp; Now,

<P>after a little acquaintance (and it was not long before they

<P>had that), this old Evil-Questioning asked the doubters if

<P>they were all of a town (he knew that they were all of one

<P>kingdom), and they answered: 'No, nor not of one shire

<P>neither; for I,' said one, 'am an election doubter:'&nbsp; 'I,'

<P>said another, 'am a vocation doubter:' then said the third,

<P>'I am a salvation doubter:' and the fourth said he was a

<P>grace doubter.&nbsp; 'Well,' quoth the old gentleman, 'be of what

<P>shire you will, I am persuaded that you are down, boys: you

<P>have the very length of my foot, are one with my heart, and

<P>shall be welcome to me.'&nbsp; So they thanked him, and were glad

<P>that they had found themselves an harbour in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Evil-Questioning to them: 'How many of your company

<P>might there be that came with you to the siege of Mansoul?'

<P>and they answered: 'There were but ten thousand doubters in

<P>all, for the rest of the army consisted of fifteen thousand

<P>blood-men.&nbsp; These blood-men,' quoth they, 'border upon our

<P>country; but, poor men! as we hear, they were every one taken

<P>by Emmanuel's forces.'&nbsp; 'Ten thousand!' quoth the old

<P>gentleman; 'I will promise you, that is a round company.&nbsp; But

<P>how came it to pass, since you were so mighty a number, that

<P>you fainted, and durst not fight your foes?'&nbsp; 'Our general,'

<P>said they, 'was the first man that did run for it.'&nbsp; 'Pray,'

<P>quoth their landlord, 'who was that, your cowardly general?'

<P>'He was once the Lord Mayor of Mansoul,' said they: 'but pray

<P>call him not a cowardly general; for whether any from the

<P>east to the west has done more service for our prince

<P>Diabolus, than has my Lord Incredulity, will be a hard

<P>question for you to answer.&nbsp; But had they catched him, they

<P>would for certain have hanged him; and we promise you,

<P>hanging is but a bad business.'&nbsp; Then said the old gentleman,

<P>'I would that all the ten thousand doubters were now well

<P>armed in Mansoul, and myself at the head of them; I would see

<P>what I could do.'&nbsp; 'Ay,' said they, 'that would be well if we

<P>could see that; but wishes, alas! what are they?' and these

<P>words were spoken aloud.&nbsp; 'Well,' said old Evil-Questioning,

<P>'take heed that you talk not too loud; you must be quat and

<P>close, and must take care of yourselves while you are here,

<P>or, I will assure you, you will be snapped.'&nbsp; 'Why?' quoth

<P>the doubters.&nbsp; 'Why!' quoth the old gentleman; 'why! because

<P>both the Prince and Lord Secretary, and their captains and

<P>soldiers, are all at present in town; yea, the town is as

<P>full of them as ever it can hold.&nbsp; And besides, there is one

<P>whose name is Willbewill, a most cruel enemy of ours, and him

<P>the Prince has made keeper of the gates, and has commanded

<P>him that, with all the diligence he can, he should look for,

<P>search out, and destroy all, and all manner of Diabolonians.

<P>And if he lighteth upon you, down you go, though your heads

<P>were made of gold.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now, to see how it happened, one of the Lord Willbewill's

<P>faithful soldiers, whose name was Mr. Diligence, stood all

<P>this while listening under old Evil-Questioning's eaves, and

<P>heard all the talk that had been betwixt him and the doubters

<P>that he entertained under his roof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The soldier was a man that my lord had much confidence in,

<P>and that he loved dearly; and that both because he was a man

<P>of courage, and also a man that was unwearied in seeking

<P>after Diabolonians to apprehend them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now this man, as I told you, heard all the talk that was

<P>between old Evil-Questioning and these Diabolonians;

<P>wherefore what does he but goes to his lord, and tells him

<P>what he had heard.&nbsp; 'And sayest thou so, my trusty?' quoth my

<P>lord.&nbsp; 'Ay,' quoth Diligence, 'that I do; and if your

<P>lordship will be pleased to go with me, you shall find it as

<P>I have said.'&nbsp; 'And are they there?' quoth my lord.&nbsp; 'I know

<P>Evil-Questioning well, for he and I were great in the time of

<P>our apostasy: but I know not now where he dwells.'&nbsp; 'But I

<P>do,' said his man, 'and if your lordship will go, I will lead

<P>you the way to his den.'&nbsp; 'Go!' quoth my lord, 'that I will.

<P>Come, my Diligence, let us go find them out.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So my lord and his man went together the direct way to his

<P>house.&nbsp; Now his man went before to show him his way, and they

<P>went till they came even under old Mr. Evil-Questioning's

<P>wall.&nbsp; Then said Diligence, 'Hark! my lord, do you know the

<P>old gentleman's tongue when you hear it?'&nbsp; 'Yes,' said my

<P>lord, 'I know it well, but I have not seen him many a day.

<P>This I know, he is cunning; I wish he doth not give us the

<P>slip.'&nbsp; 'Let me alone for that,' said his servant Diligence.

<P>'But how shall we find the door?' quoth my lord.&nbsp; 'Let me

<P>alone for that, too,' said his man.&nbsp; So he had my Lord

<P>Willbewill about, and showed him the way to the door.&nbsp; Then

<P>my lord, without more ado, broke open the door, rushed into

<P>the house, and caught them all five together, even as

<P>Diligence his man had told him.&nbsp; So my lord apprehended them,

<P>and led them away, and committed them to the hand of Mr.

<P>Trueman, the gaoler, and commanded, and he did put them in

<P>ward.&nbsp; This done, my Lord Mayor was acquainted in the morning

<P>with what my Lord Willbewill had done over night, and his

<P>lordship rejoiced much at the news, not only because there

<P>were doubters apprehended, but because that old Evil-

<P>Questioning was taken; for he had been a very great trouble

<P>to Mansoul, and much affliction to my Lord Mayor himself.&nbsp; He

<P>had also been sought for often, but no hand could ever be

<P>laid upon him till now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, the next thing was to make preparation to try these

<P>five that by my lord had been apprehended, and that were in

<P>the hands of Mr. Trueman, the gaoler.&nbsp; So the day was set,

<P>and the court called and come together, and the prisoners

<P>brought to the bar.&nbsp; My Lord Willbewill had power to have

<P>slain them when at first he took them, and that without any

<P>more ado; but he thought it at this time more for the honour

<P>of the Prince, the comfort of Mansoul, and the discouragement

<P>of the enemy, to bring them forth to public judgment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, I say, Mr. Trueman brought them in chains to the bar; to

<P>the town-hall, for that was the place of judgment.&nbsp; So, to be

<P>short, the jury was panelled, the witnesses sworn, and the

<P>prisoners tried for their lives: the jury was the same that

<P>tried Mr. No-Truth, Pitiless, Haughty, and the rest of their

<P>companions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And, first, old Questioning himself was set to the bar for he

<P>was the receiver, the entertainer, and comforter of these

<P>doubters, that by nation were outlandish men: then he was bid

<P>to hearken to his charge, and was told that he had liberty to

<P>object, if he had ought to say for himself.&nbsp; So his

<P>indictment was read: the manner and form here follows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mr. Questioning, Thou art here indicted by the name of Evil-

<P>Questioning, an intruder upon the town of Mansoul, for that

<P>thou art a Diabolonian by nature, and also a hater of the

<P>Prince Emmanuel, and one that hast studied the ruin of the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou art also here indicted for

<P>countenancing the King's enemies, after wholesome laws made

<P>to the contrary: for, 1. Thou hast questioned the truth of

<P>her doctrine and state: 2. In wishing that ten thousand

<P>doubters were in her: 3. In receiving, in entertaining, and

<P>encouraging of her enemies, that came from their army unto

<P>thee.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment? art thou guilty

<P>or not guilty?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'My lord,' quoth he, 'I know not the meaning of this

<P>indictment, forasmuch as I am not the man concerned in it;

<P>the man that standeth by this charge accused before this

<P>bench is called by the name of Evil-Questioning, which name I

<P>deny to be mine, mine being Honest-Inquiry.&nbsp; The one indeed

<P>sounds like the other; but, I trow, your lordships know that

<P>between these two there is a wide difference; for I hope that

<P>a man, even in the worst of times, and that, too, amongst the

<P>worst of men, may make an honest inquiry after things,

<P>without running the danger of death.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then spake my Lord Willbewill, for he was one of the

<P>witnesses: 'My lord, and you the honourable bench and

<P>magistrates of the town of Mansoul, you all have heard with

<P>your ears that the prisoner at the bar has denied his name,

<P>and so thinks to shift from the charge of the indictment.

<P>But I know him to be the man concerned, and that his proper

<P>name is Evil-Questioning.&nbsp; I have known him, my lord, above

<P>these thirty years, for he and I (a shame it is for me to

<P>speak it) were great acquaintance, when Diabolus, that

<P>tyrant, had the government of Mansoul; and I testify that he

<P>is a Diabolonian by nature, an enemy to our Prince, and a

<P>hater of the blessed town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He has, in times of

<P>rebellion, been at and lain in my house, my lord, not so

<P>little as twenty nights together, and we did use to talk

<P>then, for the substance of talk, as he and his doubters have

<P>talked of late: true, I have not seen him many a day.&nbsp; I

<P>suppose that the coming of Emmanuel to Mansoul has made him

<P>change his lodgings, as this indictment has driven him to

<P>change his name; but this is the man, my lord.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the court unto him, 'Hast thou any more to say?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Yes,' quoth the old gentleman, 'that I have; for all that as

<P>yet has been said against me, is but by the mouth of one

<P>witness; and it is not lawful for the famous town of Mansoul,

<P>at the mouth of one witness, to put any man to death.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood forth Mr. Diligence, and said, 'My lord, as I was

<P>upon my watch such a night at the head of Bad Street, in this

<P>town, I chanced to hear a muttering within this gentleman's

<P>house.&nbsp; Then, thought I, what is to do here?&nbsp; So I went up

<P>close, but very softly, to the side of the house to listen,

<P>thinking, as indeed it fell out, that there I might light

<P>upon some Diabolonian conventicle.&nbsp; So, as I said, I drew

<P>nearer and nearer; and when I was got up close to the wall,

<P>it was but a while before I perceived that there were

<P>outlandish men in the house; but I did well understand their

<P>speech, for I have been a traveller myself.&nbsp; Now, hearing

<P>such language in such a tottering cottage as this old

<P>gentleman dwelt in, I clapped mine ear to a hole in the

<P>window, and there heard them talk as followeth.&nbsp; This old Mr.

<P>Questioning asked these doubters what they were, whence they

<P>came, and what was their business in these parts; and they

<P>told him to all these questions, yet he did entertain them.

<P>He also asked what numbers there were of them; and they told

<P>him ten thousand men.&nbsp; He then asked them, why they made no

<P>more manly assault upon Mansoul; and they told him: so he

<P>called their general coward, for marching off when he should

<P>have fought for his prince.&nbsp; Further, this old Evil-

<P>Questioning wished, and I heard him wish, would all the ten

<P>thousand doubters were now in Mansoul, and himself at the

<P>head of them.&nbsp; He bid them also to take heed and lie quat;

<P>for if they were taken they must die, although they had heads

<P>of gold.'&nbsp; Then said the court: 'Mr. Evil-Questioning, here

<P>is now another witness against you, and his testimony is

<P>full: 1. He swears that you did receive these men into your

<P>house, and that you did nourish them there, though you knew

<P>that they were Diabolonians, and the King's enemies.&nbsp; 2. He

<P>swears that you did wish ten thousand of them in Mansoul.&nbsp; 3.

<P>He swears that you did give them advice to be quat and close,

<P>lest they were taken by the King's servants.&nbsp; All which

<P>manifesteth that thou art a Diabolonian; but hadst thou been

<P>a friend to the King, thou wouldst have apprehended them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Evil-Questioning: 'To the first of these I answer,

<P>The men that came into mine house were strangers, and I took

<P>them in; and is it now become a crime in Mansoul for a man to

<P>entertain strangers?&nbsp; That I did also nourish them is true;

<P>and why should my charity be blamed?&nbsp; As for the reason why I

<P>wished ten thousand of them in Mansoul, I never told it to

<P>the witnesses, nor to themselves.&nbsp; I might wish them to be

<P>taken, and so my wish might mean well to Mansoul, for aught

<P>that any yet knows.&nbsp; I did also bid them take heed that they

<P>fell not into the captains' hands; but that might be because

<P>I am unwilling that any man should be slain, and not because

<P>I would have the King's enemies as such escape.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Lord Mayor then replied: 'That though it was a virtue to

<P>entertain strangers, yet it was treason to entertain the

<P>King's enemies.&nbsp; And for what else thou hast said, thou dost

<P>by words but labour to evade and defer the execution of

<P>judgment.&nbsp; But could there be no more proved against thee but

<P>that thou art a Diabolonian, thou must for that die the death

<P>by the law; but to be a receiver, a nourisher, a

<P>countenancer, and a harbourer of others of them, yea, of

<P>outlandish Diabolonians, yea, of them that came from far on

<P>purpose to cut off and destroy our Mansoul - this must not be

<P>borne.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Evil-Questioning: 'I see how the game will go: I

<P>must die for my name, and for my charity.'&nbsp; And so he held

<P>his peace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they called the outlandish doubters to the bar, and the

<P>first of them that was arraigned was the election doubter.

<P>So his indictment was read; and because he was an outlandish

<P>man, the substance of it was told him by an interpreter;

<P>namely, 'That he was there charged with being an enemy of

<P>Emmanuel the Prince, a hater of the town of Mansoul, and an

<P>opposer of her most wholesome doctrine.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the judge asked him if he would plead? but he said only

<P>this - That he confessed that he was an election doubter, and

<P>that that was the religion that he had ever been brought up

<P>in.&nbsp; And said, moreover, 'If I must die for my religion, I

<P>trow, I shall die a martyr, and so I care the less.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Then it was replied: 'To question election, is to

<P>overthrow a great doctrine of the gospel, namely, the

<P>omnisciency, and power, and will of God; to take away the

<P>liberty of God with his creature, to stumble the faith of the

<P>town of Mansoul, and to make salvation to depend upon works,

<P>and not upon grace.&nbsp; It also belied the word, and disquieted

<P>the minds of the men of Mansoul; therefore by the best of

<P>laws he must die.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then was the vocation doubter called, and set to the bar; and

<P>his indictment for substance was the same with the other,

<P>only he was particularly charged with denying the calling of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The judge asked him also what he had to say for himself?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he replied: 'That he never believed that there was any

<P>such thing as a distinct and powerful call of God to Mansoul;

<P>otherwise than by the general voice of the word, nor by that

<P>neither, otherwise than as it exhorted them to forbear evil,

<P>and to do that which is good, and in so doing a promise of

<P>happiness is annexed.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the judge: 'Thou art a Diabolonian, and hast denied

<P>a great part of one of the most experimental truths of the

<P>Prince of the town of Mansoul; for he has called, and she has

<P>heard a most distinct and powerful call of her Emmanuel, by

<P>which she has been quickened, awakened, and possessed with

<P>heavenly grace to desire to have communion with her Prince,

<P>to serve him, and to do his will, and to look for her

<P>happiness merely of his good pleasure.&nbsp; And for thine

<P>abhorrence of this good doctrine, thou must die the death.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the grace doubter was called, and his indictment was

<P>read and he replied thereto: 'That though he was of the land

<P>of doubting, his father was the offspring of a Pharisee, and

<P>lived in good fashion among his neighbours, and that he

<P>taught him to believe, and believe it I do, and will, that

<P>Mansoul shall never be saved freely by grace.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the judge: 'Why, the law of the Prince is plain: 1.

<P>Negatively, "not of works:" 2. Positively, "by grace you are

<P>saved."&nbsp; And thy religion settleth in and upon the works of

<P>the flesh; for the works of the law are the works of the

<P>flesh.&nbsp; Besides, in saying as thou hast done, thou hast

<P>robbed God of His glory, and given it to a sinful man; thou

<P>hast robbed Christ of the necessity of His undertaking, and

<P>the sufficiency thereof, and hast given both these to the

<P>works of the flesh.&nbsp; Thou hast despised the work of the Holy

<P>Ghost, and hast magnified the will of the flesh, and of the

<P>legal mind.&nbsp; Thou art a Diabolonian, the son of a

<P>Diabolonian; and for thy Diabolonian principles thou must

<P>die.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The court then, having proceeded thus far with them, sent out

<P>the jury, who forthwith brought them in guilty of death.

<P>Then stood up the Recorder, and addressed himself to the

<P>prisoners: 'You, the prisoners at the bar, you have been here

<P>indicted, and proved guilty of high crimes against Emmanuel

<P>our Prince, and against the welfare of the famous town of

<P>Mansoul, crimes for which you must be put to death, and die

<P>ye accordingly.'&nbsp; So they were sentenced to the death of the

<P>cross.&nbsp; The place assigned them for execution, was that where

<P>Diabolus drew up his last army against Mansoul; save only

<P>that old Evil-Questioning was hanged at the top of Bad

<P>Street, just over against his own door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of their

<P>enemies, and of the troublers of their peace, in the next

<P>place a strict commandment was given out, that yet my Lord

<P>Willbewill should, with Diligence his man, search for, and do

<P>his best to apprehend what town Diabolonians were yet left

<P>alive in Mansoul.&nbsp; The names of several of them were, Mr.

<P>Fooling, Mr. Let-Good-Slip, Mr. Slavish-Fear, Mr. No-Love,

<P>Mr. Mistrust, Mr. Flesh, and Mr. Sloth.&nbsp; It was also

<P>commanded, that he should apprehend Mr. Evil-Questioning's

<P>children, that he left behind him, and that they should

<P>demolish his house.&nbsp; The children that he left behind him

<P>were these: Mr. Doubt, and he was his eldest son; the next to

<P>him was Legal-Life, Unbelief, Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ, Clip-

<P>Promise, Carnal-Sense, Live-by-Feeling, Self-Love.&nbsp; All these

<P>he had by one wife, and her name was No-Hope; she was the

<P>kinswoman of old Incredulity, for he was her uncle; and when

<P>her father, old Dark, was dead, he took her and brought her

<P>up, and when she was marriageable, he gave her to this old

<P>Evil-Questioning to wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now the Lord Willbewill did put into execution his

<P>commission, with great Diligence, his man.&nbsp; He took Fooling

<P>in the streets, and hanged him up in Want-wit-Alley, over

<P>against his own house.&nbsp; This Fooling was he that would have

<P>had the town of Mansoul deliver up Captain Credence into the

<P>hands of Diabolus, provided that then he would have withdrawn

<P>his force out of the town.&nbsp; He also took Mr. Let-Good-Slip

<P>one day as he was busy in the market, and executed him

<P>according to law.&nbsp; Now there was an honest poor man in

<P>Mansoul, and his name was Mr. Meditation, one of no great

<P>account in the days of apostasy, but now of repute with the

<P>best of the town.&nbsp; This man, therefore, they were willing to

<P>prefer.&nbsp; Now Mr. Let-Good-Slip had a great deal of wealth

<P>heretofore in Mansoul, and, at Emmanuel's coming, it was

<P>sequestered to the use of the Prince: this, therefore, was

<P>now given to Mr. Meditation, to improve for the common good,

<P>and after him to his son, Mr. Think-Well; this Think-Well he

<P>had by Mrs. Piety his wife, and she was the daughter of Mr.

<P>Recorder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, my lord apprehended Clip-Promise: now because he

<P>was a notorious villain, for by his doings much of the King's

<P>coin was abused, therefore he was made a public example.&nbsp; He

<P>was arraigned and judged to be first set in the pillory, then

<P>to be whipped by all the children and servants in Mansoul,

<P>and then to be hanged till he was dead.&nbsp; Some may wonder at

<P>the severity of this man's punishment; but those that are

<P>honest traders in Mansoul, are sensible of the great abuse

<P>that one clipper of promises in little time may do to the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; And truly my judgment is, that all those of

<P>his name and life should be served even as he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He also apprehended Carnal-Sense, and put him in hold; but

<P>how it came about, I cannot tell, but he brake prison, and

<P>made his escape: yea, and the bold villain will not yet quit

<P>the town, but lurks in the Diabolonian dens a days, and

<P>haunts like a ghost honest men's houses a nights.&nbsp; Wherefore,

<P>there was a proclamation set up in the market-place in

<P>Mansoul, signifying that whosoever could discover Carnal-

<P>Sense, and apprehend him and slay him, should be admitted

<P>daily to the Prince's table, and should be made keeper of the

<P>treasure of Mansoul.&nbsp; Many, therefore, did bend themselves to

<P>do this thing, but take him and slay him they could not,

<P>though often he was discovered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But my lord took Mr. Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ, and put him in

<P>prison, and he died there; though it was long first, for he

<P>died of a lingering consumption.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Self-Love was also taken and committed to custody; but there

<P>were many that were allied to him in Mansoul, so his judgment

<P>was deferred.&nbsp; But at last Mr. Self-Denial stood up, and

<P>said: 'If such villains as these may be winked at in Mansoul,

<P>I will lay down my commission.'&nbsp; He also took him from the

<P>crowd, and had him among his soldiers, and there he was

<P>brained.&nbsp; But some in Mansoul muttered at it, though none

<P>durst speak plainly, because Emmanuel was in town.&nbsp; But this

<P>brave act of Captain Self-Denial came to the Prince's ears;

<P>so he sent for him, and made him a lord in Mansoul.&nbsp; My Lord

<P>Willbewill also obtained great commendations of Emmanuel, for

<P>what he had done for the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then my Lord Self-Denial took courage, and set to the

<P>pursuing of the Diabolonians, with my Lord Willbewill; and

<P>they took Live-by-Feeling, and they took Legal-Life, and put

<P>them in hold till they died.&nbsp; But Mr. Unbelief was a nimble

<P>Jack: him they could never lay hold of, though they attempted

<P>to do it often.&nbsp; He therefore, and some few more of the

<P>subtlest of the Diabolonian tribe, did yet remain in Mansoul,

<P>to the time that Mansoul left off to dwell any longer in the

<P>kingdom of Universe.&nbsp; But they kept them to their dens and

<P>holes: if one of them did appear, or happen to be seen in any

<P>of the streets of the town of Mansoul, the whole town would

<P>be up in arms after them; yea, the very children in Mansoul

<P>would cry out after them as after a thief, and would wish

<P>that they might stone them to death with stones.&nbsp; And now did

<P>Mansoul arrive to some good degree of peace and quiet; her

<P>Prince also did abide within her borders; her captains, also,

<P>and her soldiers did their duties; and Mansoul minded her

<P>trade that she had with the country that was afar off; also

<P>she was busy in her manufacture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of so

<P>many of their enemies, and the troublers of their peace, the

<P>Prince sent to them, and appointed a day wherein he would, at

<P>the market-place, meet the whole people, and there give them

<P>in charge concerning some further matters, that, if observed,

<P>would tend to their further safety and comfort, and to the

<P>condemnation and destruction of their home-bred Diabolonians.

<P>So the day appointed was come, and the townsmen met together;

<P>Emmanuel also came down in his chariot, and all his captains

<P>in their state attending him, on the right hand and on the

<P>left.&nbsp; Then was an oyes made for silence, and, after some

<P>mutual carriages of love, the Prince began, and thus

<P>proceeded:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You, my Mansoul, and the beloved of mine heart, many and

<P>great are the privileges that I have bestowed upon you; I

<P>have singled you out from others, and have chosen you to

<P>myself, not for your worthiness, but for mine own sake.&nbsp; I

<P>have also redeemed you, not only from the dread of my

<P>Father's law, but from the hand of Diabolus.&nbsp; This I have

<P>done because I loved you, and because I have set my heart

<P>upon you to do you good.&nbsp; I have also, that all things, that

<P>might hinder thy way to the pleasures of paradise might be

<P>taken out of the way, laid down for thee for thy soul a

<P>plenary satisfaction, and have bought thee to myself; a price

<P>not of corruptible things, as of silver and gold, but a price

<P>of blood, mine own blood, which I have freely spilled upon

<P>the ground to make thee mine.&nbsp; So I have reconciled thee, O

<P>my Mansoul, to my Father, and entrusted thee in the mansion

<P>houses that are with my Father in the royal city, where

<P>things are, O my Mansoul, that eye hath not seen, nor hath

<P>entered into the heart of man to conceive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Besides, O my Mansoul, thou seest what I have done, and how

<P>I have taken thee out of the hands of thine enemies: unto

<P>whom thou hadst deeply revolted from my Father, and by whom

<P>thou wast content to be possessed, and also to be destroyed.

<P>I came to thee first by my law, then by my gospel, to awaken

<P>thee, and show thee my glory.&nbsp; And thou knowest what thou

<P>wast, what thou saidst, what thou didst, and how many times

<P>thou rebelledst against my Father and me; yet I left thee not

<P>as thou seest this day, but came to thee, have borne thy

<P>manners, have waited upon thee, and, after all, accepted of

<P>thee, even of my mere grace and favour; and would not suffer

<P>thee to be lost, as thou most willingly wouldst have been.&nbsp; I

<P>also compassed thee about, and afflicted thee on every side,

<P>that I might make thee weary of thy ways, and bring down thy

<P>heart with molestation to a willingness to close with thy

<P>good and happiness.&nbsp; And when I had gotten a complete

<P>conquest over thee, I turned it to thy advantage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou seest, also, what a company of my Father's host I have

<P>lodged within thy borders: captains and rulers, soldiers and

<P>men of war, engines and excellent devices to subdue and bring

<P>down thy foes; thou knowest my meaning, O Mansoul.&nbsp; And they

<P>are my servants, and thine, too, Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, my design of

<P>possessing of thee with them, and the natural tendency of

<P>each of them is to defend, purge, strengthen, and sweeten

<P>thee for myself, O Mansoul, and to make thee meet for my

<P>Father's presence, blessing, and glory; for thou, my Mansoul,

<P>art created to be prepared unto these.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou seest, moreover, my Mansoul, how I have passed by thy

<P>backslidings, and have healed thee.&nbsp; Indeed I was angry with

<P>thee, but I have turned mine anger away from thee, because I

<P>loved thee still, and mine anger and mine indignation is

<P>ceased in the destruction of thine enemies, O Mansoul.&nbsp; Nor

<P>did thy goodness fetch me again unto thee, after that I for

<P>thy transgressions have hid my face, and withdrawn my

<P>presence from thee.&nbsp; The way of backsliding was thine, but

<P>the way and means of thy recovery was mine.&nbsp; I invented the

<P>means of thy return; it was I that made an hedge and a wall,

<P>when thou wast beginning to turn to things in which I

<P>delighted not.&nbsp; It was I that made thy sweet bitter, thy day

<P>night, thy smooth way thorny, and that also confounded all

<P>that sought thy destruction.&nbsp; It was I that set Mr. Godly-

<P>Fear to work in Mansoul.&nbsp; It was I that stirred up thy

<P>conscience and understanding, thy will and thy affections,

<P>after thy great and woful decay.&nbsp; It was I that put life into

<P>thee, O Mansoul, to seek me, that thou mightest find me, and

<P>in thy finding find thine own health, happiness, and

<P>salvation.&nbsp; It was I that fetched the second time the

<P>Diabolonians out of Mansoul; and it was I that overcame them,

<P>and that destroyed them before thy face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And now, my Mansoul, I am returned to thee in peace, and thy

<P>transgressions against me are as if they had not been.&nbsp; Nor

<P>shall it be with thee as in former days, but I will do better

<P>for thee than at thy beginning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For yet a little while, O my Mansoul, even after a few more

<P>times are gone over thy head, I will (but be not thou

<P>troubled at what I say) take down this famous town of

<P>Mansoul, stick and stone, to the ground.&nbsp; And I will carry

<P>the stones thereof, and the timber thereof, and the walls

<P>thereof, and the dust thereof, and the inhabitants thereof,

<P>into mine own country, even into a kingdom of my Father; and

<P>will there set it up in such strength and glory, as it never

<P>did see in the kingdom where now it is placed.&nbsp; I will even

<P>there set it up for my Father's habitation; for for that

<P>purpose it was at first erected in the kingdom of Universe;

<P>and there will I make it a spectacle of wonder, a monument of

<P>mercy, and the admirer of its own mercy.&nbsp; There shall the

<P>natives of Mansoul see all that, of which they have seen

<P>nothing here: there shall they be equal to those unto whom

<P>they have been inferior here.&nbsp; And there shalt thou, O my

<P>Mansoul, have such communion with me, with my Father, and

<P>with your Lord Secretary, as it is not possible here to be

<P>enjoyed, nor ever could be, shouldest thou live in Universe

<P>the space of a thousand years.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And there, O my Mansoul, thou shalt be afraid of murderers

<P>no more; of Diabolonians, and their threats, no more.&nbsp; There,

<P>there shall be no more plots, nor contrivances, nor designs

<P>against thee, O my Mansoul.&nbsp; There thou shalt no more hear

<P>the evil-tidings, or the noise of the Diabolonian drum.

<P>There thou shalt not see the Diabolonian standard-bearers,

<P>nor yet behold Diabolus's standard.&nbsp; No Diabolonian mount

<P>shall be cast up against thee there; nor shall there the

<P>Diabolonian standard be set up to make thee afraid.&nbsp; There

<P>thou shalt not need captains, engines, soldiers, and men of

<P>war.&nbsp; There thou shalt meet with no sorrow, nor grief, nor

<P>shall it be possible that any Diabolonian should again, for

<P>ever, be able to creep into thy skirts, burrow in thy walls,

<P>or be seen again within thy borders all the days of eternity.

<P>Life shall there last longer than here you are able to desire

<P>it should; and yet it shall always be sweet and new, nor

<P>shall any impediment attend it for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'There, O Mansoul, thou shalt meet with many of those that

<P>have been like thee, and that have been partakers of thy

<P>sorrows; even such as I have chosen, and redeemed, and set

<P>apart, as thou, for my Father's court and city-royal.&nbsp; All

<P>they will be glad in thee, and thou, when thou seest them,

<P>shalt be glad in thine heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'There are things, O Mansoul, even things of my Father's

<P>providing, and mine, that never were seen since the beginning

<P>of the world; and they are laid up with my Father, and sealed

<P>up among his treasures for thee, till thou shalt come thither

<P>to enjoy them.&nbsp; I told you before, that I would remove my

<P>Mansoul, and set it up elsewhere; and where I will set it,

<P>there are those that love thee, and those that rejoice in

<P>thee now; but how much more, when they shall see thee exalted

<P>to honour!&nbsp; My Father will then send them for you to fetch

<P>you; and their bosoms are chariots to put you in.&nbsp; And you, O

<P>my Mansoul, shall ride upon the wings of the wind.&nbsp; They will

<P>come to convey, conduct, and bring you to that, when your

<P>eyes see more, that will be your desired haven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And thus, O my Mansoul, I have showed unto thee what shall

<P>be done to thee hereafter, if thou canst hear, if thou canst

<P>understand; and now I will tell thee what at present must be

<P>thy duty and practice, until I come and fetch thee to myself,

<P>according as is related in the Scriptures of truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First, I charge thee that thou dost hereafter keep more

<P>white and clean the liveries which I gave thee before my last

<P>withdrawing from thee.&nbsp; Do it, I say, for this will be thy

<P>wisdom.&nbsp; They are in themselves fine linen, but thou must

<P>keep them white and clean.&nbsp; This will be your wisdom, your

<P>honour, and will be greatly for my glory.&nbsp; When your garments

<P>are white, the world will count you mine.&nbsp; Also, when your

<P>garments are white, then I am delighted in your ways; for

<P>then your goings to and fro will be like a flash of

<P>lightning, that those that are present must take notice of;

<P>also their eyes will be made to dazzle thereat.&nbsp; Deck

<P>thyself, therefore, according to my bidding, and make thyself

<P>by my law straight steps for thy feet; so shall thy King

<P>greatly desire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and worship

<P>thou him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, that thou mayest keep them as I bid thee, I have, as I

<P>before did tell thee, provided for thee an open fountain to

<P>wash thy garments in.&nbsp; Look, therefore, that thou wash often

<P>in my fountain, and go not in defiled garments; for as it is

<P>to my dishonour and my disgrace, so it will be to thy

<P>discomfort, when you shall walk in filthy garments.&nbsp; Let not,

<P>therefore, my garments, your garments, the garments that I

<P>gave thee, be defiled or spotted by the flesh.&nbsp; Keep thy

<P>garments always white, and let thy head lack no ointment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'My Mansoul, I have ofttimes delivered thee from the designs,

<P>plots, attempts, and conspiracies of Diabolus; and for all

<P>this I ask thee nothing, but that thou render not to me evil

<P>for my good; but that thou bear in mind my love, and the

<P>continuation of my kindness to my beloved Mansoul, so as to

<P>provoke thee to walk in thy measure according to the benefit

<P>bestowed on thee.&nbsp; Of old, the sacrifices were bound with

<P>coords to the horns of the altar.&nbsp; Consider what is said to

<P>thee, O my blessed Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O my Mansoul, I have lived, I have died, I live, and will

<P>die no more for thee.&nbsp; I live, that thou mayest not die.

<P>Because I live, thou shalt live also.&nbsp; I reconciled thee to

<P>my Father by the blood of my cross; and being reconciled,

<P>thou shalt live through me.&nbsp; I will pray for thee; I will

<P>fight for thee; I will yet do thee good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Nothing can hurt thee but sin; nothing can grieve me but

<P>sin; nothing can make thee base before thy foes but sin: take

<P>heed of sin, my Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And dost thou know why I at first, and do still, suffer

<P>Diabolonians to dwell in thy walls, O Mansoul?&nbsp; It is to keep

<P>thee wakening, to try thy love, to make thee watchful, and to

<P>cause thee yet to prize my noble captains, their soldiers,

<P>and my mercy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'It is also, that yet thou mayest be made to remember what a

<P>deplorable condition thou once wast in.&nbsp; I mean when, not

<P>some, but all did dwell, not in thy walls, but in thy castle,

<P>and in thy stronghold, O Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O my Mansoul, should I slay all them within, many there be

<P>without, that would bring thee into bondage; for were all

<P>these within cut off, those without would find thee sleeping;

<P>and then, as in a moment, they would swallow up my Mansoul.

<P>I therefore left them in thee, not to do thee hurt (the which

<P>they yet will, if thou hearken to them, and serve them,) but

<P>to do thee good, the which they must, if thou watch and fight

<P>against them.&nbsp; Know, therefore, that whatever they shall

<P>tempt thee to, my design is, that they should drive thee, not

<P>further off, but nearer to my father, to learn thee war, to

<P>make petitioning desirable to thee, and to make thee little

<P>in thine own eyes.&nbsp; Hearken diligently to this, my Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Show me, then, thy love, my Mansoul, and let not those that

<P>are within thy walls, take thy affections off from him that

<P>hath redeemed thy soul.&nbsp; Yea, let the sight of a Diabolonian

<P>heighten thy love to me.&nbsp; I came once, and twice, and thrice,

<P>to save thee from the poison of those arrows that would have

<P>wrought thy death: stand for me, thy Friend, my Mansoul,

<P>against the Diabolonians, and I will stand for thee before my

<P>Father, and all his court.&nbsp; Love me against temptation, and I

<P>will love thee notwithstanding thine infirmities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O my Mansoul, remember what my captains, my soldiers, and

<P>mine engines have done for thee.&nbsp; They have fought for thee,

<P>they have suffered by thee, they have borne much at thy hands

<P>to do thee good, O Mansoul.&nbsp; Hadst thou not had them to help

<P>thee, Diabolus had certainly made a hand of thee.&nbsp; Nourish

<P>them, therefore, my Mansoul.&nbsp; When thou dost well, they will

<P>be well; when thou dost ill, they will be ill, and sick, and

<P>weak.&nbsp; Make not my captains sick, O Mansoul; for if they be

<P>sick, thou canst not be well; if they be weak, thou canst not

<P>be strong; if they be faint, thou canst not be stout and

<P>valiant for thy King, O Mansoul.&nbsp; Nor must thou think always

<P>to live by sense: thou must live upon my word.&nbsp; Thou must

<P>believe, O my Mansoul, when I am from thee, that yet I love

<P>thee, and bear thee upon mine heart for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Remember, therefore, O my Mansoul, that thou art beloved of

<P>me: as I have, therefore, taught thee to watch, to fight, to

<P>pray, and to make war against my foes; so now I command thee

<P>to believe that my love is constant to thee.&nbsp; O my Mansoul,

<P>how have I set my heart, my love upon thee!&nbsp; Watch.&nbsp; Behold,

<P>I lay none other burden upon thee, than what thou hast

<P>already.&nbsp; Hold fast, till I come.'
