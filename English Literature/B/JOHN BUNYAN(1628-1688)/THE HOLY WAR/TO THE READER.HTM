<P>'Tis strange to me, that they that love to tell

<P>Things done of old, yea, and that do excel

<P>Their equals in historiology,

<P>Speak not of Mansoul's wars, but let them lie

<P>Dead, like old fables, or such worthless things,

<P>That to the reader no advantage brings:

<P>When men, let them make what they will their own,

<P>Till they know this, are to themselves unknown.

<P>Of stories, I well know, there's divers sorts,

<P>Some foreign, some domestic; and reports

<P>Are thereof made as fancy leads the writers:

<P>(By books a man may guess at the inditers.)

<P>Some will again of that which never was,

<P>Nor will be, feign (and that without a cause)

<P>Such matter, raise such mountains, tell such things

<P>Of men, of laws, of countries, and of kings;

<P>And in their story seem to be so sage,

<P>And with such gravity clothe every page,

<P>That though their frontispiece says all is vain,

<P>Yet to their way disciples they obtain.

<P>But, readers, I have somewhat else to do,

<P>Than with vain stories thus to trouble you.

<P>What here I say, some men do know so well,

<P>They can with tears and joy the story tell.

<P>The town of Mansoul is well known to many,

<P>Nor are her troubles doubted of by any

<P>That are acquainted with those Histories

<P>That Mansoul and her wars anatomize.

<P>Then lend thine ear to what I do relate,

<P>Touching the town of Mansoul and her state:

<P>How she was lost, took captive, made a slave:

<P>And how against him set, that should her save;

<P>Yea, how by hostile ways she did oppose

<P>Her Lord, and with his enemy did close.

<P>For they are true: he that will them deny

<P>Must needs the best of records vilify.

<P>For my part, I myself was in the town,

<P>Both when 'twas set up, and when pulling down.

<P>I saw Diabolus in his possession,

<P>And Mansoul also under his oppression.

<P>Yea, I was there when she own'd him for lord,

<P>And to him did submit with one accord.

<P>When Mansoul trampled upon things divine,

<P>And wallowed in filth as doth a swine;

<P>When she betook herself unto her arms,

<P>Fought her Emmanuel, despis'd his charms;

<P>Then I was there, and did rejoice to see

<P>Diabolus and Mansoul so agree.

<P>Let no men, then, count me a fable-maker,

<P>Nor make my name or credit a partaker

<P>Of their derision: what is here in view,

<P>Of mine own knowledge, I dare say is true.

<P>I saw the Prince's armed men come down

<P>By troops, by thousands, to besiege the town;

<P>I saw the captains, heard the trumpets sound,

<P>And how his forces covered all the ground.

<P>Yea, how they set themselves in battle-'ray,

<P>I shall remember to my dying day.

<P>I saw the colours waving in the wind,

<P>And they within to mischief how combin'd

<P>To ruin Mansoul, and to make away

<P>Her primum mobile without delay.

<P>I saw the mounts cast up against the town,

<P>And how the slings were placed to beat it down:

<P>I heard the stones fly whizzing by mine ears,

<P>(What longer kept in mind than got in fears?)

<P>I heard them fall, and saw what work they made.

<P>And how old Mors did cover with his shade

<P>The face of Mansoul; and I heard her cry,

<P>'Woe worth the day, in dying I shall die!'

<P>I saw the battering-rams, and how they play'd

<P>To beat open Ear-gate; and I was afraid

<P>Not only Ear-gate, but the very town

<P>Would by those battering-rams be beaten down.

<P>I saw the fights, and heard the captains shout,

<P>And in each battle saw who faced about;

<P>I saw who wounded were, and who were slain;

<P>And who, when dead, would come to life again.

<P>I heard the cries of those that wounded were,

<P>(While others fought like men bereft of fear,)

<P>And while the cry, 'Kill, kill,' was in mine ears,

<P>The gutters ran, not so with blood as tears.

<P>Indeed, the captains did not always fight,

<P>But then they would molest us day and night;

<P>Their cry, 'Up, fall on, let us take the town,'

<P>Kept us from sleeping, or from lying down.

<P>I was there when the gates were broken ope,

<P>And saw how Mansoul then was stripp'd of hope;

<P>I saw the captains march into the town,

<P>How there they fought, and did their foes cut down.

<P>I heard the Prince bid Boanerges go

<P>Up to the castle, and there seize his foe;

<P>And saw him and his fellows bring him down,

<P>In chains of great contempt quite through the town.

<P>I saw Emmanuel, when he possess'd

<P>His town of Mansoul; and how greatly blest

<P>A town his gallant town of Mansoul was,

<P>When she received his pardon, loved his laws.

<P>When the Diabolonians were caught,

<P>When tried, and when to execution brought,

<P>Then I was there; yea, I was standing by

<P>When Mansoul did the rebels crucify.

<P>I also saw Mansoul clad all in white,

<P>I heard her Prince call her his heart's delight.

<P>I saw him put upon her chains of gold,

<P>And rings, and bracelets, goodly to behold.

<P>What shall I say?&nbsp; I heard the people's cries,

<P>And saw the Prince wipe tears from Mansoul's eyes.

<P>And heard the groans, and saw the joy of many:

<P>Tell you of all, I neither will, nor can I.

<P>But by what here I say, you well may see

<P>That Mansoul's matchless wars no fables be.

<P>Mansoul, the desire of both princes was:

<P>One keep his gain would, t'other gain his loss.

<P>Diabolus would cry, 'The town is mine!'

<P>Emmanuel would plead a right divine

<P>Unto his Mansoul: then to blows they go,

<P>And Mansoul cries, 'These wars will me undo.'

<P>Mansoul! her wars seemed endless in her eyes;

<P>She's lost by one, becomes another's prize:

<P>And he again that lost her last would swear,

<P>'Have her I will, or her in pieces tear.'

<P>Mansoul! it was the very seat of war;

<P>Wherefore her troubles greater were by far

<P>Than only where the noise of war is heard,

<P>Or where the shaking of a sword is fear'd;

<P>Or only where small skirmishes are fought,

<P>Or where the fancy fighteth with a thought.

<P>She saw the swords of fighting men made red,

<P>And heard the cries of those with them wounded:

<P>Must not her frights, then, be much more by far

<P>Than theirs that to such doings strangers are?

<P>Or theirs that hear the beating of a drum,

<P>But not made fly for fear from house and home?

<P>Mansoul not only heard the trumpet's sound,

<P>But saw her gallants gasping on the ground:

<P>Wherefore we must not think that she could rest

<P>With them, whose greatest earnest is but jest:

<P>Or where the blust'ring threat'ning of great wars

<P>Do end in parlies, or in wording jars.

<P>Mansoul! her mighty wars, they did portend

<P>Her weal or woe, and that world without end:

<P>Wherefore she must be more concern'd than they

<P>Whose fears begin, and end the selfsame day;

<P>Or where none other harm doth come to him

<P>That is engaged, but loss of life or limb,

<P>As all must needs confess that now do dwell

<P>In Universe, and can this story tell.

<P>Count me not, then, with them that, to amaze

<P>The people, set them on the stars to gaze,

<P>Insinuating with much confidence,

<P>That each of them is now the residence

<P>Of some brave creatures: yea, a world they will

<P>Have in each star, though it be past their skill

<P>To make it manifest to any man,

<P>That reason hath, or tell his fingers can.

<P>But I have too long held thee in the porch,

<P>And kept thee from the sunshine with a torch,

<P>Well, now go forward, step within the door,

<P>And there behold five hundred times much more

<P>Of all sorts of such inward rarities

<P>As please the mind will, and will feed the eyes

<P>With those, which, if a Christian, thou wilt see

<P>Not small, but things of greatest moment be.

<P>Nor do thou go to work without my key;

<P>(In mysteries men soon do lose their way;)

<P>And also turn it right, if thou wouldst know

<P>My riddle, and wouldst with my heifer plough;

<P>It lies there in the window.&nbsp; Fare thee well,

<P>My next may be to ring thy passing-bell.
