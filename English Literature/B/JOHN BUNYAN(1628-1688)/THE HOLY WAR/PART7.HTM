<P>'We could also do no less than admire your faithfulness to

<P>us, with the greatness of that subtilty that now hath showed

<P>itself to be in your heads to serve us against the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; For you have invented for us so excellent a method

<P>for our proceeding against that rebellious people, a more

<P>effectual cannot be thought of by all the wits of hell.&nbsp; The

<P>proposals, therefore, which now, at last, you have sent us,

<P>since we saw them, we have done little else but highly

<P>approved and admired them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Nay, we shall, to encourage you in the profundity of your

<P>craft, let you know, that, at a full assembly and conclave of

<P>our princes and principalities of this place, your project

<P>was discoursed and tossed from one side of our cave to the

<P>other by their mightinesses; but a better, and as was by

<P>themselves judged, a more fit and proper way by all their

<P>wits, could not be invented, to surprise, take, and make our

<P>own, the rebellious town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Wherefore, in fine, all that was said that varied from what

<P>you had in your letter propounded, fell of itself to the

<P>ground, and yours only was stuck to by Diabolus, the prince;

<P>yea, his gaping gorge and yawning paunch was on fire to put

<P>your invention into execution.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'We therefore give you to understand that our stout, furious,

<P>and unmerciful Diabolus is raising, for your relief, and the

<P>ruin of the rebellious town of Mansoul, more than twenty

<P>thousand doubters to come against that people.&nbsp; They are all

<P>stout and sturdy men, and men that of old have been

<P>accustomed to war, and that can therefore well endure the

<P>drum.&nbsp; I say, he is doing this work of his with all the

<P>possible speed he can; for his heart and spirit is engaged in

<P>it.&nbsp; We desire, therefore, that, as you have hitherto stuck

<P>to us, and given us both advice and encouragement thus far,

<P>you still will prosecute our design; nor shall you lose, but

<P>be gainers thereby; yea, we intend to make you the lords of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'One thing may not by any means be omitted, that is, those

<P>with us do desire that every one of you that are in Mansoul

<P>would still use all your power, cunning, and skill, with

<P>delusive persuasions, yet to draw the town of Mansoul into

<P>more sin and wickedness, even that sin may be finished and

<P>bring forth death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'For thus it is concluded with us, that the more vile,

<P>sinful, and debauched the town of Mansoul is, more backward

<P>will be their Emmanuel to come to their help, either by

<P>presence or other relief; yea, the more sinful, the more

<P>weak, and so the more unable will they be to make resistance

<P>when we shall make our assault upon them to swallow them up.

<P>Yea, that may cause that their mighty Shaddai himself may

<P>cast them out of his protection; yea, and send for his

<P>captains and soldiers home, with his slings and rams, and

<P>leave them naked and bare; and then the town of Mansoul will

<P>of itself open to us, and fall as the fig into the mouth of

<P>the eater.&nbsp; Yea, to be sure. that we then with a great deal

<P>of ease shall come upon her and overcome her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'As to the time of our coming upon Mansoul, we, as yet, have

<P>not fully resolved upon that, though at present some of us

<P>think as you, that a market-day, or a market-day at night,

<P>will certainly be the best.&nbsp; However, do you be ready, and

<P>when you shall hear our roaring drum without, do you be as

<P>busy to make the most horrible confusion within.&nbsp; So shall

<P>Mansoul certainly be distressed before and behind, and shall

<P>not know which way to betake herself for help.&nbsp; My Lord

<P>Lucifer, my Lord Beelzebub, my Lord Apollyon, my Lord Legion,

<P>with the rest, salute you, as does also my Lord Diabolus; and

<P>we wish both you, with all that you do, or shall possess, the

<P>very self-same fruit and success for their doing as we

<P>ourselves at present enjoy for ours.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'From our dreadful confines in the most fearful pit, we

<P>salute you, and so do those many legions here with us,

<P>wishing you may be as hellishly prosperous as we desire to be

<P>ourselves.&nbsp; By the letter-carrier, Mr. Profane.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Mr. Profane addressed himself for his return to Mansoul,

<P>with his errand from the horrible pit to the Diabolonians

<P>that dwelt in that town.&nbsp; So he came up the stairs from the

<P>deep to the mouth of the cave where Cerberus was.&nbsp; Now when

<P>Cerberus saw him, he asked how did matters go below, about

<P>and against the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; Things go as well as we can expect.&nbsp; The letter that
I

<P>carried thither was highly approved, and well liked by all my

<P>lords, and I am returning to tell our Diabolonians so.&nbsp; I

<P>have an answer to it here in my bosom, that I am sure will

<P>make our masters that sent me glad; for the contents thereof

<P>are to encourage them to pursue their design to the utmost,

<P>and to be ready also to fall on within, when they shall see

<P>my Lord Diabolus beleaguering the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CERB.&nbsp; But does he intend to go against them himself?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; Does he!&nbsp; Ay! and he will take along with him more

<P>than twenty thousand, all sturdy Doubters, and men of war,

<P>picked men from the land of Doubting, to serve him in the

<P>expedition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then was Cerberus glad, and said, 'And is there such brave

<P>preparations a-making to go against the miserable town of

<P>Mansoul?&nbsp; And would I might be put at the head of a thousand

<P>of them, that I might also show my valour against the famous

<P>town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; Your wish may come to pass; you look like one that has

<P>mettle enough, and my lord will have with him those that are

<P>valiant and stout.&nbsp; But my business requires haste.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CERB.&nbsp; Ay, so it does.&nbsp; Speed thee to the town of Mansoul,

<P>with all the deepest mischiefs that this place can afford

<P>thee.&nbsp; And when thou shalt come to the house of Mr. Mischief,

<P>the place where the Diabolonians meet to plot, tell them that

<P>Cerberus doth wish them his service, and that if he may, he

<P>will with the army come up against the famous town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; That I will.&nbsp; And I know that my lords that are there

<P>will be glad to hear it, and to see you also.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So after a few more such kind of compliments, Mr. Profane

<P>took his leave of his friend Cerberus; and Cerberus again,

<P>with a thousand of their pit-wishes, bid him haste, with all

<P>speed, to his masters.&nbsp; The which when he had heard, he made

<P>obeisance, and began to gather up his heels to run.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus, therefore, he returned, and went and came to Mansoul;

<P>and going, as afore, to the house of Mr. Mischief, there he

<P>found the Diabolonians assembled, and waiting for his return.

<P>Now when he was come, and had presented himself, he also

<P>delivered to them his letter, and adjoined this compliment to

<P>them therewith: 'My lords, from the confines of the pit, the

<P>high and mighty principalities and powers of the den salute

<P>you here, the true Diabolonians of the town of Mansoul.

<P>Wishing you always the most proper of their benedictions, for

<P>the great service, high attempts, and brave achievements that

<P>you have put yourselves upon, for the restoring to our prince

<P>Diabolus the famous town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was therefore the present state of the miserable town of

<P>Mansoul: she had offended her Prince, and he was gone; she

<P>had encouraged the powers of hell, by her foolishness, to

<P>come against her to seek her utter destruction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>True, the town of Mansoul was somewhat made sensible of her

<P>sin, but the Diabolonians were gotten into her bowels; she

<P>cried, but Emmanuel was gone, and her cries did not fetch him

<P>as yet again.&nbsp; Besides, she knew not now whether, ever or

<P>never, he would return and come to his Mansoul again; nor did

<P>they know the power and industry of the enemy, nor how

<P>forward they were to put in execution that plot of hell that

<P>they had devised against her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They did, indeed, still send petition after petition to the

<P>Prince, but he answered all with silence.&nbsp; They did neglect

<P>reformation, and that was as Diabolus would have it; for he

<P>knew, if they regarded iniquity in their heart, their King

<P>would not hear their prayer; they therefore did still grow

<P>weaker and weaker, and were as a rolling thing before the

<P>whirlwind.&nbsp; They cried to their King for help, and laid

<P>Diabolonians in their bosoms: what therefore should a King do

<P>to them?&nbsp; Yea, there seemed now to be a mixture in Mansoul;

<P>the Diabolonians and the Mansoulians would walk the streets

<P>together.&nbsp; Yea, they began to seek their peace; for they

<P>thought that, since the sickness had been so mortal in

<P>Mansoul, it was in vain to go to handygripes with them.

<P>Besides, the weakness of Mansoul was the strength of their

<P>enemies; and the sins of Mansoul, the advantage of the

<P>Diabolonians.&nbsp; The foes of Mansoul did also now begin to

<P>promise themselves the town for a possession: there was no

<P>great difference now betwixt Mansoulians and Diabolonians:

<P>both seemed to be masters of Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, the Diabolonians

<P>increased and grew, but the town of Mansoul diminished

<P>greatly.&nbsp; There were more than eleven thousand men, women,

<P>and children that died by the sickness in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now, as Shaddai would have it, there was one whose name

<P>was Mr. Prywell, a great lover of the people of Mansoul.&nbsp; And

<P>he, as his manner was, did go listening up and down in

<P>Mansoul to see, and to hear, if at any time he might, whether

<P>there was any design against it or no.&nbsp; For he was always a

<P>jealous man, and feared some mischief sometime would befal

<P>it, either from the Diabolonians within, or from some power

<P>without.&nbsp; Now upon a time it so happened, as Mr. Prywell went

<P>listening here and there, that he lighted upon a place called

<P>Vilehill, in Mansoul, where Diabolonians used to meet; so

<P>hearing a muttering, (you must know that it was in the

<P>night,) he softly drew near to hear; nor had he stood long

<P>under the house-end, (for there stood a house there,) but he

<P>heard one confidently affirm, that it was not, or would not

<P>be long before Diabolus should possess himself again of

<P>Mansoul; and that then the Diabolonians did intend to put all

<P>Mansoulians to the sword, and would kill and destroy the

<P>King's captains, and drive all his soldiers out of the town.

<P>He said, moreover, that he knew there were above twenty

<P>thousand fighting men prepared by Diabolus for the

<P>accomplishing of this design, and that it would not be months

<P>before they all should see it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Mr. Prywell had heard this story, he did quickly believe

<P>it was true: wherefore he went forthwith to my Lord Mayor's

<P>house, and acquainted him therewith; who, sending for the

<P>subordinate preacher, brake the business to him; and he as

<P>soon gave the alarm to the town; for he was now the chief

<P>preacher in Mansoul, because, as yet, my Lord Secretary was

<P>ill at ease.&nbsp; And this was the way that the subordinate

<P>preacher did take to alarm the town therewith.&nbsp; The same hour

<P>he caused the lecture bell to be rung; so the people came

<P>together: he gave them then a short exhortation to

<P>watchfulness, and made Mr. Prywell's news the argument

<P>thereof.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'an horrible plot is contrived

<P>against Mansoul, even to massacre us all in a day, nor is

<P>this story to be slighted; for Mr. Prywell is the author

<P>thereof.&nbsp; Mr. Prywell was always a lover of Mansoul, a sober

<P>and judicious man, a man that is no tattler, nor raiser of

<P>false reports, but one that loves to look into the very

<P>bottom of matters, and talks nothing of news, but by very

<P>solid arguments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I will call him, and you shall hear him your own selves;' so

<P>he called him, and he came and told his tale so punctually,

<P>and affirmed its truth with such ample grounds, that Mansoul

<P>fell presently under a conviction of the truth of what he

<P>said.&nbsp; The preacher did also back him, saying, 'Sirs, it is

<P>not irrational for us to believe it, for we have provoked

<P>Shaddai to anger, and have sinned Emmanuel out of the town;

<P>we have had too much correspondence with Diabolonians, and

<P>have forsaken our former mercies: no marvel then, if the

<P>enemy both within and without should design and plot our

<P>ruin; and what time like this to do it?&nbsp; The sickness is now

<P>in the town, and we have been made weak thereby.&nbsp; Many a good

<P>meaning man is dead, and the Diabolonians of late grow

<P>stronger and stronger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Besides,' quoth the subordinate preacher, 'I have received

<P>from this good truth-teller this one inkling further, that he

<P>understood by those that he overheard, that several letters

<P>have lately passed between the furies and the Diabolonians in

<P>order to our destruction.'&nbsp; When Mansoul heard all this, and

<P>not being able to gainsay it, they lift up their voice and

<P>wept.&nbsp; Mr. Prywell did also, in the presence of the townsmen,

<P>confirm all that their subordinate preacher had said.

<P>Wherefore they now set afresh to bewail their folly, and to a

<P>doubling of petitions to Shaddai and his Son.&nbsp; They also

<P>brake the business to the captains, high commanders, and men

<P>of war in the town of Mansoul, entreating them to use the

<P>means to be strong, and to take good courage; and that they

<P>would look after their harness, and make themselves ready to

<P>give Diabolus battle by night and by day, shall he come, as

<P>they are informed he will, to beleaguer the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the captains heard this, they being always true lovers

<P>of the town of Mansoul, what do they but like so many Samsons

<P>they shake themselves, and come together to consult and

<P>contrive how to defeat those bold and hellish contrivances

<P>that were upon the wheel by the means of Diabolus and his

<P>friends against the now sickly, weakly, and much impoverished

<P>town of Mansoul; and they agreed upon these following

<P>particulars:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. That the gates of Mansoul should be kept shut, and made

<P>fast with bars and locks, and that all persons that went out,

<P>or came in, should be very strictly examined by the captains

<P>of the guards, 'to the end,' said they, 'that those that are

<P>managers of the plot amongst us, may, either coming or going,

<P>be taken; and that we may also find out who are the great

<P>contrivers, amongst us, of our ruin.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. The next thing was, that a strict search should be made

<P>for all kind of Diabolonians throughout the whole town of

<P>Mansoul; and that every man's house from top to bottom should

<P>be looked into, and that, too, house by house, that if

<P>possible a further discovery might be made of all such among

<P>them as had a hand in these designs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. It was further concluded upon, that wheresoever or with

<P>whomsoever any of the Diabolonians were found, that even

<P>those of the town of Mansoul that had given them house and

<P>harbour, should to their shame, and the warning of others,

<P>take penance in the open place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. It was, moreover, resolved by the famous town of Mansoul,

<P>that a public fast, and a day of humiliation, should be kept

<P>throughout the whole corporation, to the justifying of their

<P>Prince, the abasing of themselves before him for their

<P>transgressions against him, and against Shaddai, his Father.

<P>It was further resolved, that all such in Mansoul as did not

<P>on that day endeavour to keep that fast, and to humble

<P>themselves for their faults, but that should mind their

<P>worldly employs, or be found wandering up and down the

<P>streets, should be taken for Diabolonians, and should suffer

<P>as Diabolonians for such their wicked doings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>5. It was further concluded then, that with what speed, and

<P>with what warmth of mind they could, they would renew their

<P>humiliation for sin, and their petitions to Shaddai for help;

<P>they also resolved, to send tidings to the court of all that

<P>Mr. Prywell had told them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>6. It was also determined, that thanks should be given by the

<P>town of Mansoul to Mr. Prywell, for his diligent seeking of

<P>the welfare of their town: and further, that forasmuch as he

<P>was so naturally inclined to seek their good, and also to

<P>undermine their foes, they gave him a commission of scout-

<P>master-general, for the good of the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the corporation, with their captains, had thus

<P>concluded, they did as they had said; they shut up their

<P>gates, they made for Diabolonians strict search, they made

<P>those with whom any were found to take penance in the open

<P>place: they kept their fast, and renewed their petitions to

<P>their Prince, and Mr. Prywell managed his charge and the

<P>trust that Mansoul had put in his hands, with great

<P>conscience and good fidelity; for he gave himself wholly up

<P>to his employ, and that not only within the town, but he went

<P>out to pry, to see, and to hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And not many days after he provided for his journey, and went

<P>towards Hell-Gate Hill, into the country where the Doubters

<P>were, where he heard of all that had been talked of in

<P>Mansoul, and he perceived also that Diabolus was almost ready

<P>for his march, etc.&nbsp; So he came back with speed, and, calling

<P>the captains and elders of Mansoul together, he told them

<P>where he had been, what he had heard, and what he had seen.

<P>Particularly, he told them that Diabolus was almost ready for

<P>his march, and that he had made old Mr. Incredulity, that

<P>once brake prison in Mansoul, the, general of his army; that

<P>his army consisted all of Doubters, and that their number was

<P>above twenty thousand.&nbsp; He told, moreover, that Diabolus did

<P>intend to bring with him the chief princes of the infernal

<P>pit, and that he would make them chief captains over his

<P>Doubters.&nbsp; He told them, moreover, that it was certainly true

<P>that several of the black den would, with Diabolus, ride

<P>reformades to reduce the town of Mansoul to the obedience of

<P>Diabolus, their prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He said, moreover, that he understood by the Doubters, among

<P>whom he had been, that the reason why old Incredulity was

<P>made general of the whole army, was because none truer than

<P>he to the tyrant; and because he had an implacable spite

<P>against the welfare of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Besides, said

<P>he, he remembers the affronts that Mansoul has given him, and

<P>he is resolved to be revenged of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the black princes shall be made high commanders, only

<P>Incredulity shall be over them all; because, which I had

<P>almost forgot, he can more easily, and more dexterously,

<P>beleaguer the town of Mansoul, than can any of the princes

<P>besides.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the captains of Mansoul, with the elders of the

<P>town, had heard the tidings that Mr. Prywell did bring, they

<P>thought it expedient, without further delay, to put into

<P>execution the laws that against the Diabolonians their Prince

<P>had made for them, and given them in commandment to manage

<P>against them.&nbsp; Wherefore, forthwith a diligent and impartial

<P>search was made in all houses in Mansoul, for all and all

<P>manner of Diabolonians.&nbsp; Now, in the house of Mr. Mind, and

<P>in the house of the great Lord Willbewill, were two

<P>Diabolonians found.&nbsp; In Mr. Mind's house was one Lord

<P>Covetousness found; but he had changed his name to Prudent-

<P>Thrifty.&nbsp; In my Lord Willbewill's house, one Lasciviousness

<P>was found; but he had changed his name to Harmless-Mirth.

<P>These two the captains and elders of the town of Mansoul

<P>took, and committed them to custody under the hand of Mr.

<P>Trueman, the gaoler; and this man handled them so severely,

<P>and loaded them so well with irons, that in time they both

<P>fell into a very deep consumption, and died in the prison-

<P>house; their masters also, according to the agreement of the

<P>captains and elders, were brought to take penance in the open

<P>place to their shame, and for a warning to the rest of the

<P>town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, this was the manner of penance in those days: the

<P>persons offending being made sensible of the evil of their

<P>doings, were enjoined open confession of their faults, and a

<P>strict amendment of their lives.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, the captains and elders of Mansoul sought yet to

<P>find out more Diabolonians, wherever they lurked, whether in

<P>dens, caves, holes, vaults, or where else they could, in or

<P>about the wall or town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But though they could

<P>plainly see their footing, and so follow them by their track

<P>and smell to their holds, even to the mouths of their caves

<P>and dens, yet take them, hold them, and do justice upon them,

<P>they could not; their ways were so crooked, their holds so

<P>strong, and they so quick to take sanctuary there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mansoul did now with so stiff an hand rule over the

<P>Diabolonians that were left, that they were glad to shrink

<P>into corners: time was when they durst walk openly, and in

<P>the day; but now they were forced to embrace privacy and the

<P>night: time was when a Mansoulian was their companion; but

<P>now they counted them deadly enemies.&nbsp; This good change did

<P>Mr. Prywell's intelligence make in the famous town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By this time, Diabolus had finished his army which he

<P>intended to bring with him for the ruin of Mansoul; and had

<P>set over them captains, and other field officers, such as

<P>liked his furious stomach best: himself was lord paramount,

<P>Incredulity was general of his army, their highest captains

<P>shall be named afterwards; but now for their officers,

<P>colours, and scutcheons.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. Their first captain was Captain Rage: he was captain over

<P>the election doubters, his were the red colours; his

<P>standard-bearer was Mr. Destructive, and the great red dragon

<P>he had for his scutcheon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. The second captain was Captain Fury: he was captain over

<P>the vocation doubters; his standard-bearer was Mr. Darkness,

<P>his colours were those that were pale, and he had for his

<P>scutcheon the fiery flying serpent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. The third captain was Captain Damnation: he was captain

<P>over the grace doubters; his were the red colours, Mr. No-

<P>Life bare them, and he had for his scutcheon the black den.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. The fourth captain was Captain Insatiable; he was captain

<P>over the faith doubters: his were the red colours, Mr.

<P>Devourer bare them, and he had for a scutcheon the yawning

<P>jaws.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>5. The fifth captain was Captain Brimstone: he was captain

<P>over the perseverance doubters; his also were the red

<P>colours, Mr. Burning bare them, and his scutcheon was the

<P>blue and stinking flame.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>6. The sixth captain was Captain Torment: he was captain over

<P>the resurrection doubters; his colours were those that were

<P>pale; Mr. Gnaw was his standard-bearer, and he had the black

<P>worm for his scutcheon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>7. The seventh captain was Captain No-Ease; he was captain

<P>over the salvation doubters; his were the red colours, Mr.

<P>Restless bare them, and his scutcheon was the ghastly picture

<P>of death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>8. The eighth captain was the Captain Sepulchre: he was

<P>captain over the glory doubters; his also were the pale

<P>colours, Mr. Corruption was his standard-bearer, and he had

<P>for his scutcheon a skull, and dead men's bones.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>9. The ninth captain was Captain Past-Hope; he was captain of

<P>those that are called the felicity doubters; his standard-

<P>bearer was Mr. Despair; his also were the red colours, and

<P>his scutcheon was a hot iron and the hard heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were his captains, and these were their forces, these

<P>were their standards, these were their colours, and these

<P>were their scutcheons.&nbsp; Now, over these did the great

<P>Diabolus make superior captains, and they were in number

<P>seven: as, namely, the Lord Beelzebub, the Lord Lucifer, the

<P>Lord Legion, the Lord Apollyon, the Lord Python, the Lord

<P>Cerberus, and the Lord Belial; these seven he set over the

<P>captains, and Incredulity was lord-general, and, Diabolus was

<P>king.&nbsp; The reformades also, such as were like themselves,

<P>were made some of them captains of hundreds, and some of them

<P>captains of more.&nbsp; And thus was the army of Incredulity

<P>completed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they set out at Hell-Gate Hill, for there they had their

<P>rendezvous, from whence they came with a straight course upon

<P>their march toward the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now, as was hinted

<P>before, the town had, as Shaddai would have it, received from

<P>the mouth of Mr. Prywell the alarm of their coming before.

<P>Wherefore they set a strong watch at the gates, and had also

<P>doubled their guards: they also mounted their slings in good

<P>places, where they might conveniently cast out their great

<P>stones to the annoyance of their furious enemy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nor could those Diabolonians that were in the town do that

<P>hurt as was designed they should; for Mansoul was now awake.

<P>But alas! poor people, they were sorely affrighted at the

<P>first appearance of their foes, and at their sitting down

<P>before the town, especially when they heard the roaring of

<P>their drum.&nbsp; This, to speak truth, was amazingly hideous to

<P>hear; it frighted all men seven miles round, if they were but

<P>awake and heard it.&nbsp; The streaming of their colours was also

<P>terrible and dejecting to behold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus was come up against the town, first he made his

<P>approach to Ear-gate, and gave it a furious assault,

<P>supposing, as it seems, that his friends in Mansoul had been

<P>ready to do the work within; but care was taken of that

<P>before, by the vigilance of the captains.&nbsp; Wherefore, missing

<P>of the help that he expected from them, and finding his army

<P>warmly attended with the stones that the slingers did sling,

<P>(for that I will say for the captains, that considering the

<P>weakness that yet was upon them by reason of the long

<P>sickness that had annoyed the town of Mansoul, they did

<P>gallantly behave themselves,) he was forced to make some

<P>retreat from Mansoul, and to entrench himself and his men in

<P>the field without the reach of the slings of the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now having entrenched himself, he did cast up four mounts

<P>against the town: the first he called Mount Diabolus, putting

<P>his own name thereon, the more to affright the town of

<P>Mansoul; the other three he called thus - Mount Alecto, Mount

<P>Megara, and Mount Tisiphone; for these are the names of the

<P>dreadful furies of hell.&nbsp; Thus he began to play his game with

<P>Mansoul, and to serve it as doth the lion his prey, even to

<P>make it fall before his terror.&nbsp; But, as I said, the captains

<P>and soldiers resisted so stoutly, and did do such execution

<P>with their stones, that they made him, though against

<P>stomach, to retreat, wherefore Mansoul began to take courage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now upon Mount Diabolus, which was raised on the north side

<P>of the town, there did the tyrant set up his standard, and a

<P>fearful thing it was to behold; for he had wrought in it by

<P>devilish art, after the manner of a scutcheon, a flaming

<P>flame fearful to behold, and the picture of Mansoul burning

<P>in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus had thus done, he commanded that his drummer

<P>should every night approach the walls of the town of Mansoul,

<P>and so to beat a parley; the command was to do it at nights,

<P>for in the daytime they annoyed him with their slings; for

<P>the tyrant said, that he had a mind to parley with the now

<P>trembling town of Mansoul, and he commanded that the drums

<P>should beat every night, that through weariness they might at

<P>last, if possible, (at the first they were unwilling yet,) be

<P>forced to do it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So this drummer did as commanded: he arose, and did beat his

<P>drum.&nbsp; But when his drum did go, if one looked toward the

<P>town of Mansoul, 'Behold darkness and sorrow, and the light

<P>was darkened in the heaven thereof.'&nbsp; No noise was ever heard

<P>upon earth more terrible, except the voice of Shaddai when he

<P>speaketh.&nbsp; But how did Mansoul tremble! it now looked for

<P>nothing but forthwith to be swallowed up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this drummer had beaten for a parley, he made this

<P>speech to Mansoul: 'My master has bid me tell you, that if

<P>you will willingly submit, you shall have the good of the

<P>earth; but if you shall be stubborn, he is resolved to take

<P>you by force.'&nbsp; But by that the fugitive had done beating his

<P>drum, the people of Mansoul had betaken themselves to the

<P>captains that were in the castle, so that there was none to

<P>regard, nor to give this drummer an answer; so he proceeded

<P>no further that night, but returned again to his master to

<P>the camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus saw that by drumming he could not work out

<P>Mansoul to his will, the next night he sendeth his drummer

<P>without his drum, still to let the townsmen know that he had

<P>a mind to parley with them.&nbsp; But when all came to all, his

<P>parley was turned into a summons to the town to deliver up

<P>themselves: but they gave him neither heed nor hearing: for

<P>they remembered what at first it cost them to hear him a few

<P>words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next night he sends again, and then who should be his

<P>messenger to Mansoul but the terrible Captain Sepulchre; so

<P>Captain Sepulchre came up to the walls of Mansoul, and made

<P>this oration to the town:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O ye inhabitants of the rebellious town of Mansoul!&nbsp; I

<P>summon you in the name of the Prince Diabolus, that, without

<P>any more ado, you set open the gates of your town, and admit

<P>the great lord to come in.&nbsp; But if you shall still rebel,

<P>when we have taken to us the town by force, we will swallow

<P>you up as the grave; wherefore if you will hearken to my

<P>summons, say so, and if not then let me know.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The reason of this my summons,' quoth he, 'is, for that my

<P>lord is your undoubted prince and lord, as you yourselves

<P>have formerly owned.&nbsp; Nor shall that assault that was given

<P>to my lord, when Emmanuel dealt so dishonourably by him,

<P>prevail with him to lose his right, and to forbear to attempt

<P>to recover his own.&nbsp; Consider, then, O Mansoul, with thyself,

<P>wilt thou show thyself peaceable, or no?&nbsp; If thou shalt

<P>quietly yield up thyself, then our old friendship shall be

<P>renewed; but if thou shalt yet refuse and rebel, then expect

<P>nothing but fire and sword.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the languishing town of Mansoul had heard this summoner

<P>and his summons, they were yet more put to their dumps, but

<P>made to the captain no answer at all; so away he went as he

<P>came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, after some consultation among themselves, as also with

<P>some of their captains, they applied themselves afresh to the

<P>Lord Secretary for counsel and advice from him; for this Lord

<P>Secretary was their chief preacher, (as also is mentioned

<P>some pages before,) only now he was ill at ease; and of him

<P>they begged favour in these two or three things -
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. That he would look comfortably upon them, and not keep

<P>himself so much retired from them as formerly.&nbsp; Also, that he

<P>would be prevailed with to give them a hearing, while they

<P>should make known their miserable condition to him.&nbsp; But to

<P>this he told them as before, that 'as yet he was but ill at

<P>ease, and therefore could not do as he had formerly done.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. The second thing that they desired was, that he would be

<P>pleased to give them his advice about their now so important

<P>affairs, for that Diabolus was come and set down before the

<P>town with no less than twenty thousand doubters.&nbsp; They said,

<P>moreover, that both he and his captains were cruel men, and

<P>that they were afraid of them.&nbsp; But to this he said, 'You

<P>must look to the law of the Prince, and there see what is

<P>laid upon you to do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. Then they desired that his highness would help them to

<P>frame a petition to Shaddai, and unto Emmanuel his Son, and

<P>that he would set his own hand thereto as a token that he was

<P>one with them in it: 'For,' said they, 'my Lord, many a one

<P>have we sent, but can get no answer of peace; but now,

<P>surely, one with thy hand unto it may obtain good for

<P>Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But all the answer that he gave to this was, 'that they had

<P>offended their Emmanuel, and had also grieved himself, and

<P>that therefore they must as yet partake of their own

<P>devices.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This answer of the Lord Secretary fell like a millstone upon

<P>them; yea, it crushed them so that they could not tell what

<P>to do; yet they durst not comply with the demands of

<P>Diabolus, nor with the demands of his captain.&nbsp; So then here

<P>were the straits that the town of Mansoul was betwixt, when

<P>the enemy came upon her: her foes were ready to swallow her

<P>up, and her friends did forbear to help her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood up my Lord Mayor, whose name was my Lord

<P>Understanding, and he began to pick and pick, until he had

<P>picked comfort out of that seemingly bitter saying of the

<P>Lord Secretary; for thus he descanted upon it: 'First,' said

<P>he, 'this unavoidably follows upon the saying of my Lord,

<P>"that we must yet suffer for our sins."&nbsp; Secondly, But,'

<P>quoth he, 'the words yet sound as if at last we should be

<P>saved from our enemies, and that after a few more sorrows,

<P>Emmanuel will come and be our help.'&nbsp; Now the Lord Mayor was

<P>the more critical in his dealing with the Secretary's words,

<P>because my lord was more than a prophet, and because none of

<P>his words were such, but that at all times they were most

<P>exactly significant; and the townsmen were allowed to pry

<P>into them, and to expound them to their best advantage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they took their leaves of my lord, and returned, and went,

<P>and came to the captains, to whom they did tell what my Lord

<P>High Secretary had said; who, when they had heard it, were

<P>all of the same opinion as was my Lord Mayor himself.&nbsp; The

<P>captains, therefore, began to take some courage unto them,

<P>and to prepare to make some brave attempt upon the camp of

<P>the enemy, and to destroy all that were Diabolonians, with

<P>the roving doubters that the tyrant had brought with him to

<P>destroy the poor town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So all betook themselves forthwith to their places - the

<P>Captains to theirs, the Lord Mayor to his, the subordinate

<P>preacher to his, and my Lord Willbewill to his.&nbsp; The captains

<P>longed to be at some work for their prince; for they

<P>delighted in warlike achievements.&nbsp; The next day, therefore,

<P>they came together and consulted; and after consultation had,

<P>they resolved to give an answer to the captain of Diabolus

<P>with slings; and so they did at the rising of the sun on the

<P>morrow; for Diabolus had adventured to come nearer again, but

<P>the sling-stones were to him and his like hornets.&nbsp; For as

<P>there is nothing to the town of Mansoul so terrible as the

<P>roaring of Diabolus's drum, so there is nothing to Diabolus

<P>so terrible as the well playing of Emmanuel's slings.

<P>Wherefore Diabolus was forced to make another retreat, yet

<P>further off from the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Then did the

<P>Lord Mayor of Mansoul cause the bells to be rung, 'and that

<P>thanks should be sent to the Lord High Secretary by the mouth

<P>of the subordinate preacher; for that by his words the

<P>captains and elders of Mansoul had been strengthened against

<P>Diabolus.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus saw that his captains and soldiers, high lords

<P>and renowned, were frightened, and beaten down by the stones

<P>that came from the golden slings of the Prince of the town of

<P>Mansoul, he bethought himself, and said, 'I will try to catch

<P>them by fawning, I will try to flatter them into my net.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore, after a while, he came down again to the wall, not

<P>now with his drum, nor with Captain Sepulchre; but having all

<P>besugared his lips, he seemed to be a very sweet-mouthed,

<P>peaceable prince, designing nothing for humour's sake, nor to

<P>be revenged on Mansoul for injuries by them done to him; but

<P>the welfare, and good, and advantage of the town and people

<P>therein was now, as he said, his only design.&nbsp; Wherefore,

<P>after he had called for audience, and desired that the

<P>townsfolk would give it to him, he proceeded in his oration,

<P>and said:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Oh, the desire of my heart, the famous town of Mansoul! how

<P>many nights have I watched, and how many weary steps have I

<P>taken, if perhaps I might do thee good!&nbsp; Far be it, far be it

<P>from me to desire to make a war upon you; if ye will but

<P>willingly and quietly deliver up yourselves unto me.&nbsp; You

<P>know that you were mine of old.&nbsp; Remember also, that so long

<P>as you enjoyed me for your lord, and that I enjoyed you for

<P>my subjects, you wanted for nothing of all the delights of

<P>the earth, that I, your lord and prince, could get for you,

<P>or that I could invent to make you bonny and blithe withal.

<P>Consider, you never had so many hard, dark, troublesome, and

<P>heart-afflicting hours, while you were mine, as you have had

<P>since you revolted from me; nor shall you ever have peace

<P>again, until you and I become one as before.&nbsp; But, be but

<P>prevailed with to embrace me again, and I will grant, yea,

<P>enlarge your old charter with abundance of privileges; so

<P>that your license and liberty shall be to take, hold, enjoy,

<P>and make your own all that is pleasant from the east to the

<P>west.&nbsp; Nor shall any of those incivilities, wherewith you

<P>have offended me, be ever charged upon you by me, so long as

<P>the sun and moon endure.&nbsp; Nor shall any of those dear friends

<P>of mine that now, for the fear of you, lie lurking in dens,

<P>and holes, and caves in Mansoul, be hurtful to you any more;

<P>yea, they shall be your servants, and shall minister unto you

<P>of their substance, and of whatever shall come to hand.&nbsp; I

<P>need speak no more; you know them, and have sometime since

<P>been much delighted in their company.&nbsp; Why, then, should we

<P>abide at such odds?&nbsp; Let us renew our old acquaintance and

<P>friendship again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Bear with your friend; I take the liberty at this time to

<P>speak thus freely unto you.&nbsp; The love that I have to you

<P>presses me to do it, as also does the zeal of my heart for my

<P>friends with you: put me not therefore to further trouble,

<P>nor yourselves to further fears and frights.&nbsp; Have you I

<P>will, in a way of peace or war; nor do you flatter yourselves

<P>with the power and force of your captains, or that your

<P>Emmanuel will shortly come in to your help; for such strength

<P>will do you no pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I am come against you with a stout and valiant army, and all

<P>the chief princes of the den are even at the head of it.

<P>Besides, my captains are swifter than eagles, stronger than

<P>lions, and more greedy of prey than are the evening wolves.

<P>What is Og of Bashan! what is Goliath of Gath! and what are

<P>an hundred more of them, to one of the least of my captains!

<P>How, then, shall Mansoul think to escape my hand and force?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus having thus handed his flattering, fawning,

<P>deceitful, and lying speech to the famous town of Mansoul,

<P>the Lord Mayor replied to him as follows: 'O Diabolus, prince

<P>of darkness, and master of all deceit; thy lying flatteries

<P>we have had and made sufficient probation of, and have tasted

<P>too deeply of that destructive cup already.&nbsp; Should we

<P>therefore again hearken unto thee, and so break the

<P>commandments of our great Shaddai, to join in affinity with

<P>thee, would not our Prince reject us, and cast us off for

<P>ever?&nbsp; And, being cast off by him, can the place that he has

<P>prepared for thee be a place of rest for us?&nbsp; Besides, O thou

<P>that art empty and void of all truth, we are rather ready to

<P>die by thy hand, than to fall in with thy flattering and

<P>lying deceits.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the tyrant saw that there was little to be got by

<P>parleying with my Lord Mayor, he fell into an hellish rage,

<P>and resolved that again, with his army of doubters, he would

<P>another time assault the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he called for his drummer, who beat up for his men (and

<P>while he did beat, Mansoul did shake) to be in a readiness to

<P>give battle to the corporation: then Diabolus drew near with

<P>his army, and thus disposed of his men.&nbsp; Captain Cruel and

<P>Captain Torment, these he drew up and placed against Feel-

<P>gate, and commanded them to sit down there for the war.&nbsp; And

<P>he also appointed that, if need were, Captain No-Ease should

<P>come in to their relief.&nbsp; At Nose-gate he placed the Captain

<P>Brimstone and Captain Sepulchre, and bid them look well to

<P>their ward, on that side of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But at Eye-

<P>gate he placed that grim-faced one, the Captain Past-Hope,

<P>and there also now he did set up his terrible standard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Captain Insatiable, he was to look to the carriages of

<P>Diabolus, and was also appointed to take into custody that,

<P>or those persons and things, that should at any time as prey

<P>be taken from the enemy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Mouth-gate the inhabitants of Mansoul kept for a sally-

<P>port; wherefore that they kept strong; for that it was it by

<P>and out at which the townsfolk did send their petitions to

<P>Emmanuel their Prince.&nbsp; That also was the gate from the top

<P>of which the captains did play their slings at the enemies;

<P>for that gate stood somewhat ascending, so that the placing

<P>of them there, and the letting of them fly from that place,

<P>did much execution against the tyrant's army.&nbsp; Wherefore, for

<P>these causes, with others, Diabolus sought, if possible, to

<P>land up Mouth-gate with dirt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, as Diabolus was busy and industrious in preparing to

<P>make his assault upon the town of Mansoul, without, so the

<P>captains and soldiers in the corporation were as busy in

<P>preparing within; they mounted their slings, they set up

<P>their banners, they sounded their trumpets, and put

<P>themselves in such order as was judged most for the annoyance

<P>of the enemy, and for the advantage of Mansoul, and gave to

<P>their soldiers orders to be ready at the sound of the trumpet

<P>for war.&nbsp; The Lord Willbewill also, he took the charge of

<P>watching against the rebels within, and to do what he could

<P>to take them while without, or to stifle them within their

<P>caves, dens, and holes in the town-wall of Mansoul.&nbsp; And, to

<P>speak the truth of him, ever since he took penance for his

<P>fault, he has showed as much honesty and bravery of spirit as

<P>any he in Mansoul; for he took one Jolly, and his brother

<P>Griggish, the two sons of his servant Harmless-Mirth, (for to

<P>that day, though the father was committed to ward, the sons

<P>had a dwelling in the house of my lord,) - I say, he took

<P>them, and with his own hands put them to the cross.&nbsp; And this

<P>was the reason why he hanged them up: after their father was

<P>put into the hands of Mr. True-Man the gaoler, they, his

<P>sons, began to play his pranks, and to be ticking and toying

<P>with the daughters of their lord; nay, it was jealoused that

<P>they were too familiar with them, the which was brought to

<P>his lordship's ear.&nbsp; Now his lordship being unwilling

<P>unadvisedly to put any man to death, did not suddenly fall

<P>upon them, but set watch and spies to see if the thing was

<P>true; of the which he was soon informed, for his two

<P>servants, whose names were Find-Out and Tell-All, catched

<P>them together in uncivil manner more than once or twice, and

<P>went and told their lord.&nbsp; So when my Lord Willbewill had

<P>sufficient ground to believe the thing was true, he takes the

<P>two young Diabolonians, (for such they were, for their father

<P>was a Diabolonian born,) and has them to Eye-gate, where he

<P>raised a very high cross, just in the face of Diabolus, and

<P>of his army, and there he hanged the young villains, in

<P>defiance to Captain Past-Hope, and of the horrible standard

<P>of the tyrant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now this Christian act of the brave Lord Willbewill did

<P>greatly abash Captain Past-Hope, discouraged the army of

<P>Diabolus, put fear into the Diabolonian runagates in Mansoul,

<P>and put strength and courage into the captains that belonged

<P>to Emmanuel, the Prince; for they without did gather, and

<P>that by this very act of my Lord, that Mansoul was resolved

<P>to fight, and that the Diabolonians within the town could not

<P>do such things as Diabolus had hopes they would.&nbsp; Nor was

<P>this the only proof of the brave Lord Willbewill's honesty to

<P>the town, nor of his loyalty to his Prince, as will

<P>afterwards appear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the children of Prudent-Thrifty, who dwelt with Mr.

<P>Mind, (for Thrift left children with Mr. Mind, when he was

<P>also committed to prison, and their names were Gripe and

<P>Rake-All; these he begat of Mr. Mind's bastard daughter,

<P>whose name was Mrs. Hold-fast-Bad;) - I say, when his

<P>children perceived how the Lord Willbewill had served them

<P>that dwelt with him, what do they but, lest they should drink

<P>of the same cup, endeavour to make their escape.&nbsp; But Mr.

<P>Mind, being wary of it, took them and put them in hold in his

<P>house till morning; (for this was done over night;) and

<P>remembering that by the law of Mansoul all Diabolonians were

<P>to die, (and to be sure they were at least by father's side

<P>such, and some say by mother's side too,) what does he but

<P>takes them and puts them in chains, and carries them to the

<P>selfsame place where my lord hanged his two before, and there

<P>he hanged them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The townsmen also took great encouragement at this act of Mr.

<P>Mind, and did what they could to have taken some more of

<P>these Diabolonian troublers of Mansoul; but at that time the

<P>rest lay so squat and close, that they could not be

<P>apprehended; so they set against them a diligent watch, and

<P>went every man to his place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I told you a little before, that Diabolus and his army were

<P>somewhat abashed and discouraged at the sight of what my Lord

<P>Willbewill did, when he hanged up those two young

<P>Diabolonians; but his discouragement quickly turned itself

<P>into furious madness and rage against the town of Mansoul,

<P>and fight it he would.&nbsp; Also the townsmen and captains

<P>within, they had their hopes and their expectations

<P>heightened, believing at last the day would be theirs; so

<P>they feared them the less.&nbsp; Their subordinate preacher, too,

<P>made a sermon about it; and he took that theme for his text,

<P>'Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at

<P>the last.'&nbsp; Whence he showed, that though Mansoul should be

<P>sorely put to it at the first, yet the victory should most

<P>certainly be Mansoul's at the last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Diabolus commanded that his drummer should beat a charge

<P>against the town; and the captains also that were in the town

<P>sounded a charge against them, but they had no drum: they

<P>were trumpets of silver with which they sounded against them.

<P>Then they which were of the camp of Diabolus came down to the

<P>town to take it, and the captains in the castle, with the

<P>slingers at Mouth-gate, played upon them amain.&nbsp; And now

<P>there was nothing heard in the camp of Diabolus but horrible

<P>rage and blasphemy; but in the town good words, prayer, and

<P>singing of psalms.&nbsp; The enemy replied with horrible

<P>objections, and the terribleness of their drum; but the town

<P>made answer with the slapping of their slings, and the

<P>melodious noise of their trumpets.&nbsp; And thus the fight lasted

<P>for several days together, only now and then they had some

<P>small intermission, in the which the townsmen refreshed

<P>themselves, and the captains made ready for another assault.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The captains of Emmanuel were clad in silver armour, and the

<P>soldiers in that which was of proof; the soldiers of Diabolus

<P>were clad in iron which was made to give place to Emmanuel's

<P>engine-shot.&nbsp; In the town, some were hurt, and some were

<P>greatly wounded.&nbsp; Now, the worst of it was, a chirurgeon was

<P>scarce in Mansoul, for that Emmanuel at present was absent.

<P>Howbeit, with the leaves of a tree the wounded were kept from

<P>dying; yet their wounds did greatly putrefy, and some did

<P>grievously stink.&nbsp; Of the townsmen, these were wounded,

<P>namely, my Lord Reason; he was wounded in the head.&nbsp; Another

<P>that was wounded was the brave Lord Mayor; he was wounded in

<P>the eye.&nbsp; Another that was wounded was Mr. Mind; he received

<P>his wound about the stomach.&nbsp; The honest subordinate preacher

<P>also, he received a shot not far off the heart but none of

<P>these were mortal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Many also of the inferior sort were not only wounded but

<P>slain outright.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, in the camp of Diabolus were wounded and slain a

<P>considerable number; for instance, Captain Rage, he was

<P>wounded, and so was Captain Cruel.&nbsp; Captain Damnation was

<P>made to retreat, and to intrench himself further off of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; The standard also of Diabolus was beaten down, and

<P>his standard-bearer, Captain Much-Hurt, had his brains beat

<P>out with a sling-stone, to the no little grief and shame of

<P>his prince Diabolus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Many also of the doubters were slain outright, though enough

<P>of them were left alive to make Mansoul shake and totter.

<P>Now the victory that day being turned to Mansoul, did put

<P>great valour into the townsmen and captains, and did cover

<P>Diabolus's camp with a cloud, but withal it made them far

<P>more furious.&nbsp; So the next day Mansoul rested, and commanded

<P>that the bells should be rung; the trumpets also joyfully

<P>sounded, and the captains shouted round the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Lord Willbewill also was not idle, but did notable service

<P>within against the domestics, or the Diabolonians that were

<P>in the town, not only by keeping them in awe, for he lighted

<P>on one at last whose name was Mr. Anything, a fellow of whom

<P>mention was made before; for it was he, if you remember, that

<P>brought the three fellows to Diabolus, whom the Diabolonians

<P>took out of Captain Boanerges's companies, and that persuaded

<P>them to list themselves under the tyrant, to fight against

<P>the army of Shaddai.&nbsp; My Lord Willbewill did also take a

<P>notable Diabolonian, whose name was Loose-Foot: this Loose-

<P>Foot was a scout to the vagabonds in Mansoul, and that did

<P>use to carry tidings out of Mansoul to the camp, and out of

<P>the camp to those of the enemies in Mansoul.&nbsp; Both these my

<P>lord sent away safe to Mr. True-Man, the gaoler, with a

<P>commandment to keep them in irons; for he intended then to

<P>have them out to be crucified, when it would be for the best

<P>to the corporation, and most for the discouragement of the

<P>camp of the enemies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Lord Mayor also, though he could not stir about so much as

<P>formerly, because of the wound that he lately received, yet

<P>gave he out orders to all that were the natives of Mansoul,

<P>to look to their watch, and stand upon their guard, and, as

<P>occasion should offer, to prove themselves men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Conscience, the preacher, he also did his utmost to keep

<P>all his good documents alive upon the hearts of the people of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, awhile after, the captains and stout ones of the town

<P>of Mansoul agreed and resolved upon a time to make a sally

<P>out upon the camp of Diabolus, and this must be done in the

<P>night; and there was the folly of Mansoul, (for the night is

<P>always the best for the enemy, but the worst for Mansoul to

<P>fight in,) but yet they would do it, their courage was so

<P>high; their last victory also still stuck in their memories.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the night appointed being come, the Prince's brave

<P>captains cast lots who should lead the van in this new and

<P>desperate expedition against Diabolus, and against his

<P>Diabolonian army; and the lot fell to Captain Credence, to

<P>Captain Experience, and to Captain Good-Hope, to lead the

<P>forlorn hope.&nbsp; (This Captain Experience the Prince created

<P>such when himself did reside in the town of Mansoul.)&nbsp; So, as

<P>I said, they made their sally out upon the army that lay in

<P>the siege against them; and their hap was to fall in with the

<P>main body of their enemies.&nbsp; Now Diabolus and his men being

<P>expertly accustomed to night-work, took the alarm presently,

<P>and were as ready to give them battle, as if they had sent

<P>them word of their coming.&nbsp; Wherefore to it they went amain,

<P>and blows were hard on every side; the hell drum also was

<P>beat most furiously, while the trumpets of the Prince most

<P>sweetly sounded.&nbsp; And thus the battle was joined; and Captain

<P>Insatiable looked to the enemy's carriages, and waited when

<P>he should receive some prey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Prince's captains fought it stoutly, beyond what indeed

<P>could be expected they should; they wounded many; they made

<P>the whole army of Diabolus to make a retreat.&nbsp; But I cannot

<P>tell how, but the brave Captain Credence, Captain Good-Hope,

<P>and Captain Experience, as they were upon the pursuit,

<P>cutting down, and following hard after the enemy in the rear,

<P>Captain Credence stumbled and fell, by which fall he caught

<P>so great a hurt, that he could not rise till Captain

<P>Experience did help him up, at which their men were put in

<P>disorder.&nbsp; The captain also was so full of pain, that he

<P>could not forbear but aloud to cry out: at this, the other

<P>two captains fainted, supposing that Captain Credence had

<P>received his mortal wound; their men also were more

<P>disordered, and had no list to fight.&nbsp; Now Diabolus being

<P>very observing, though at this time as yet he was put to the

<P>worst, perceiving that a halt was made among the men that

<P>were the pursuers, what does he but, taking it for granted

<P>that the captains were either wounded or dead, he therefore

<P>makes at first a stand, then faces about, and so comes up

<P>upon the Prince's army with as much of his fury as hell could

<P>help him to; and his hap was to fall in just among the three

<P>captains, Captain Credence, Captain Good-Hope, and Captain

<P>Experience, and did cut, wound, and pierce them so

<P>dreadfully, that what through discouragement, what through

<P>disorder, and what through the wounds that they had received,

<P>and also the loss of much blood, they scarce were able,

<P>though they had for their power the three best hands in

<P>Mansoul, to get safe into the hold again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the body of the Prince's army saw how these three

<P>captains were put to the worst, they thought it their wisdom

<P>to make as safe and good a retreat as they could, and so

<P>returned by the sally-port again; and so there was an end of

<P>this present action.&nbsp; But Diabolus was so flushed with this

<P>night's work, that he promised himself, in few days, an easy

<P>and complete conquest over the town of Mansoul; wherefore, on

<P>the day following, he comes up to the sides thereof with

<P>great boldness, and demands entrance, and that forthwith they

<P>deliver themselves up to his government.&nbsp; The Diabolonians,

<P>too, that were within, they began to be somewhat brisk, as we

<P>shall show afterward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the valiant Lord Mayor replied, that what he got he must

<P>get by force; for as long as Emmanuel, their Prince, was

<P>alive, (though he at present was not so with them as they

<P>wished,) they should never consent to yield Mansoul up to

<P>another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And with that the Lord Willbewill stood up, and said,

<P>'Diabolus, thou master of the den, and enemy to all that is

<P>good, we poor inhabitants of the town of Mansoul are too well

<P>acquainted with thy rule and government, and with the end of

<P>those things that for certain will follow submitting to thee,

<P>to do it.&nbsp; Wherefore though while we were without knowledge

<P>we suffered thee to take us, (as the bird that saw not the

<P>snare fell into the hands of the fowler,) yet since we have

<P>been turned from darkness to light, we have also been turned

<P>from the power of Satan to God.&nbsp; And though through thy

<P>subtlety, and also the subtlety of the Diabolonians within,

<P>we have sustained much loss, and also plunged ourselves into

<P>much perplexity, yet give up ourselves, lay down our arms,

<P>and yield to so horrid a tyrant as thou, we shall not; die

<P>upon the place we choose rather to do.&nbsp; Besides, we have

<P>hopes that in time deliverance will come from court unto us,

<P>and therefore we yet will maintain a war against thee.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This brave speech of the Lord Willbewill, with that also of

<P>the Lord Mayor, did somewhat abate the boldness of Diabolus,

<P>though it kindled the fury of his rage.&nbsp; It also succoured

<P>the townsmen and captains; yea, it was as a plaster to the

<P>brave Captain Credence's wound; for you must know that a

<P>brave speech now (when the captains of the town with their

<P>men of war came home routed, and when the enemy took courage

<P>and boldness at the success that he had obtained to draw up

<P>to the walls, and demand entrance, as he did) was in season,

<P>and also advantageous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Lord Willbewill also did play the man within; for while

<P>the captains and soldiers were in the field, he was in arms

<P>in the town, and wherever by him there was a Diabolonian

<P>found, they were forced to feel the weight of his heavy hand,

<P>and also the edge of his penetrating sword: many therefore of

<P>the Diabolonians he wounded, as the Lord Cavil, the Lord

<P>Brisk, the Lord Pragmatic, and the Lord Murmur; several also

<P>of the meaner sort he did sorely maim; though there cannot at

<P>this time an account be given you of any that he slew

<P>outright.&nbsp; The cause, or rather the advantage that my Lord

<P>Willbewill had at this time to do thus, was for that the

<P>captains were gone out to fight the enemy in the field.&nbsp; 'For

<P>now,' thought the Diabolonians within, 'is our time to stir

<P>and make an uproar in the town.'&nbsp; What do they therefore but

<P>quickly get themselves into a body, and fall forthwith to

<P>hurricaning in Mansoul, as if now nothing but whirlwind and

<P>tempest should be there.&nbsp; Wherefore, as I said, he takes this

<P>opportunity to fall in among them with his men, cutting and

<P>slashing with courage that was undaunted; at which the

<P>Diabolonians with all haste dispersed themselves to their

<P>holds, and my lord to his place as before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This brave act of my lord did somewhat revenge the wrong done

<P>by Diabolus to the captains, and also did let them know that

<P>Mansoul was not to be parted with for the loss of a victory

<P>or two; wherefore the wing of the tyrant was clipped again,

<P>as to boasting, - I mean in comparison of what he would have

<P>done, if the Diabolonians had put the town to the same plight

<P>to which he had put the captains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, Diabolus yet resolves to have the other bout with

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; 'For,' thought he, 'since I beat them once, I may

<P>beat them twice.'&nbsp; Wherefore he commanded his men to be ready

<P>at such an hour of the night, to make a fresh assault upon

<P>the town; and he gave it out in special that they should bend

<P>all their force against Feel-gate, and attempt to break into

<P>the town through that.&nbsp; The word that then he did give to his

<P>officers and soldiers was Hell-fire.&nbsp; 'And,' said he, 'if we

<P>break in upon them, as I wish we do, either with some, or

<P>with all our force, let them that break in look to it, that

<P>they forget not the word.&nbsp; And let nothing be heard in the

<P>town of Mansoul but, "Hell-fire!&nbsp; Hell-fire! Hell-fire!"'

<P>The drummer was also to beat without ceasing, and the

<P>standard-bearers were to display their colours; the soldiers,

<P>too, were to put on what courage they could, and to see that

<P>they played manfully their parts against the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when night was come, and all things by the tyrant made

<P>ready for the work, he suddenly makes his assault upon Feel-

<P>gate, and after he had awhile struggled there, he throws the

<P>gate wide open: for the truth is, those gates were but weak,

<P>and so most easily made to yield.&nbsp; When Diabolus had thus far

<P>made his attempt, he placed his captains (namely, Torment and

<P>No-Ease) there; so he attempted to press forward, but the

<P>Prince's captains came down upon him, and made his entrance

<P>more difficult than he desired.&nbsp; And, to speak truth, they

<P>made what resistance they could; but the three of their best

<P>and most valiant captains being wounded, and by their wounds

<P>made much incapable of doing the town that service they

<P>would, (and all the rest having more than their hands full of

<P>the doubters, and their captains that did follow Diabolus,)

<P>they were overpowered with force, nor could they keep them

<P>out of the town.&nbsp; Wherefore the Prince's men and their

<P>captains betook themselves to the castle, as to the

<P>stronghold of the town: and this they did partly for their

<P>own security, partly for the security of the town, and

<P>partly, or rather chiefly, to preserve to Emmanuel the

<P>prerogative-royal of Mansoul; for so was the castle of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The captains therefore being fled into the castle, the enemy,

<P>without much resistance, possess themselves of the rest of

<P>the town, and spreading themselves as they went into every

<P>corner, they cried out as they marched, according to the

<P>command of the tyrant, 'Hell-fire! Hell-fire! Hell-fire!' so

<P>that nothing for a while throughout the town of Mansoul could

<P>be heard but the direful noise of 'Hell-fire!' together with

<P>the roaring of Diabolus's drum.&nbsp; And now did the clouds hang

<P>black over Mansoul, nor to reason did anything but ruin seem

<P>to attend it.&nbsp; Diabolus also quartered his soldiers in the

<P>houses of the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, the

<P>subordinate preacher's house was as full of these outlandish

<P>doubters as ever it could hold, and so was my Lord Mayor's,

<P>and my Lord Willbewill's also.&nbsp; Yea, where was there a

<P>corner, a cottage, a barn, or a hogstye, that now was not

<P>full of these vermin?&nbsp; Yea, they turned the men of the town

<P>out of their houses, and would lie in their beds, and sit at

<P>their tables themselves.&nbsp; Ah, poor Mansoul! now thou feelest

<P>the fruits of sin, yea, what venom was in the flattering

<P>words of Mr. Carnal-Security!&nbsp; They made great havoc of

<P>whatever they laid their hands on; yea, they fired the town

<P>in several places; many young children also were by them

<P>dashed in pieces; and those that were yet unborn they

<P>destroyed in their mothers' wombs: for you must needs think

<P>that it could not now be otherwise; for what conscience, what

<P>pity, what bowels of compassion can any expect at the hands

<P>of outlandish doubters?&nbsp; Many in Mansoul that were women,

<P>both young and old, they forced, ravished, and beastlike

<P>abused, so that they swooned, miscarried, and many of them

<P>died, and so lay at the top of every street, and in all by-

<P>places of the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now did Mansoul seem to be nothing but a den of dragons,

<P>an emblem of hell, and a place of total darkness.&nbsp; Now did

<P>Mansoul lie almost like the barren wilderness; nothing but

<P>nettles, briars, thorns, weeds, and stinking things seemed

<P>now to cover the face of Mansoul.&nbsp; I told you before, how

<P>that these Diabolonian doubters turned the men of Mansoul out

<P>of their beds, and now I will add, they wounded them, they

<P>mauled them, yea, and almost brained many of them.&nbsp; Many did

<P>I say, yea most, if not all of them.&nbsp; Mr. Conscience they so

<P>wounded, yea, and his wounds so festered, that he could have

<P>no ease day nor night, but lay as if continually upon a rack;

<P>but that Shaddai rules all, certainly they had slain him

<P>outright.&nbsp; Mr. Lord Mayor they so abused that they almost put

<P>out his eyes; and had not my Lord Willbewill got into the

<P>castle, they intended to have chopped him all to pieces; for

<P>they did look upon him, as his heart now stood, to be one of

<P>the very worst that was in Mansoul against Diabolus and his

<P>crew.&nbsp; And indeed he hath shown himself a man, and more of

<P>his exploits you will hear of afterwards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, a man might have walked for days together in Mansoul,

<P>and scarcely have seen one in the town that looked like a

<P>religious man.&nbsp; Oh, the fearful state of Mansoul now! now

<P>every corner swarmed with outlandish doubters; red-coats and

<P>black-coats walked the town by clusters, and filled up all

<P>the houses with hideous noises, vain songs, lying stories,

<P>and blasphemous language against Shaddai and his Son.&nbsp; Now

<P>also those Diabolonians that lurked in the walls and dens and

<P>holes that were in the town of Mansoul, came forth and showed

<P>themselves; yea, walked with open face in company with the

<P>doubters that were in Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, they had more boldness

<P>now to walk the streets, to haunt the houses, and to show

<P>themselves abroad, than had any of the honest inhabitants of

<P>the now woful town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Diabolus and his outlandish men were not at peace in

<P>Mansoul; for they were not there entertained as were the

<P>captains and forces of Emmanuel: the townsmen did browbeat

<P>them what they could; nor did they partake or make stroy of

<P>any of the necessaries of Mansoul, but that which they seized

<P>on against the townsmen's will: what they could, they hid

<P>from them, and what they could not, they had with an ill-

<P>will.&nbsp; They, poor hearts! had rather have had their room than

<P>their company; but they were at present their captives, and

<P>their captives for the present they were forced to be.&nbsp; But,

<P>I say, they discountenanced them as much as they were able,

<P>and showed them all the dislike that they could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The captains also from the castle did hold them in continual

<P>play with their slings, to the chafing and fretting of the

<P>minds of the enemies.&nbsp; True, Diabolus made a great many

<P>attempts to have broken open the gates of the castle, but Mr.

<P>Godly-Fear was made the keeper of that; and he was a man of

<P>that courage, conduct, and valour, that it was in vain, as

<P>long as life lasted within him, to think to do that work,

<P>though mostly desired; wherefore all the attempts that

<P>Diabolus made against him were fruitless.&nbsp; I have wished

<P>sometimes that that man had had the whole rule of the town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, this was the condition of the town of Mansoul for about

<P>two years and a half: the body of the town was the seat of

<P>war, the people of the town were driven into holes, and the

<P>glory of Mansoul was laid in the dust.&nbsp; What rest, then,

<P>could be to the inhabitants, what peace could Mansoul have,

<P>and what sun could shine upon it?&nbsp; Had the enemy lain so long

<P>without in the plain against the town, it had been enough to

<P>have famished them: but now, when they shall be within, when

<P>the town shall be their tent, their trench and fort against

<P>the castle that was in the town; when the town shall be

<P>against the town, and shall serve to be a defence to the

<P>enemies of her strength and life: I say, when they shall make

<P>use of the forts and town-holds to secure themselves in, even

<P>till they shall take, spoil, and demolish the castle, - this

<P>was terrible! and yet this was now the state of the town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After the town of Mansoul had been in this sad and lamentable

<P>condition, for so long a time as I have told you, and no

<P>petitions that they presented their Prince with, all this

<P>while, could prevail, the inhabitants of the town, namely,

<P>the elders and chief of Mansoul, gathered together, and,

<P>after some time spent in condoling their miserable state and

<P>this miserable judgment coming upon them, they agreed

<P>together to draw up yet another petition, and to send it away

<P>to Emmanuel for relief.&nbsp; But Mr. Godly-Fear stood up and

<P>answered, that he knew that his Lord the Prince never did nor

<P>ever would receive a petition for these matters, from the

<P>hand of any whoever, unless the Lord Secretary's hand was to

<P>it; 'and this,' quoth he, 'is the reason that you prevailed

<P>not all this while.'&nbsp; Then they said they would draw up one,

<P>and get the Lord Secretary's hand unto it.&nbsp; But Mr. Godly-

<P>Fear answered again, that he knew also that the Lord

<P>Secretary would not set his hand to any petition that himself

<P>had not an hand in composing and drawing up.&nbsp; 'And besides,'

<P>said he, 'the Prince doth know my Lord Secretary's hand from

<P>all the hands in the world; wherefore he cannot be deceived

<P>by any pretence whatever.&nbsp; Wherefore my advice is that you go

<P>to my Lord, and implore him to lend you his aid.'&nbsp; (Now he

<P>did yet abide in the castle, where all the captains and men-

<P>at-arms were.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they heartily thanked Mr. Godly-Fear, took his counsel,

<P>and did as he had bidden them.&nbsp; So they went and came to my

<P>Lord, and made known the cause of their coming to him;

<P>namely, that since Mansoul was in so deplorable a condition,

<P>his Highness would be pleased to undertake to draw up a

<P>petition for them to Emmanuel, the Son of the mighty Shaddai,

<P>and to their King and his Father by him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Secretary to them, 'What petition is it that

<P>you would have me draw up for you?'&nbsp; But they said, 'Our Lord

<P>knows best the state and condition of the town of Mansoul;

<P>and how we are backslidden and degenerated from the Prince:

<P>thou also knowest who is come up to war against us, and how

<P>Mansoul is now the seat of war.&nbsp; My Lord knows, moreover,

<P>what barbarous usages our men, women, and children have

<P>suffered at their hands; and how our homebred Diabolonians do

<P>walk now with more boldness than dare the townsmen in the

<P>streets of Mansoul.&nbsp; Let our Lord therefore, according to the

<P>wisdom of God that is in him, draw up a petition for his poor

<P>servants to our Prince Emmanuel.'&nbsp; 'Well,' said the Lord

<P>Secretary, 'I will draw up a petition for you, and will also

<P>set my hand thereto.'&nbsp; Then said they, 'But when shall we

<P>call for it at the hands of our Lord?'&nbsp; But he answered,

<P>'Yourselves must be present at the doing of it; yea, you must

<P>put your desires to it.&nbsp; True, the hand and pen shall be

<P>mine, but the ink and paper must be yours; else how can you

<P>say it is your petition?&nbsp; Nor have I need to petition for

<P>myself, because I have not offended.' He also added as

<P>followeth: 'No petition goes from me in my name to the

<P>Prince, and so to his Father by him, but when the people that

<P>are chiefly concerned therein do join in heart and soul in

<P>the matter, for that must be inserted therein.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they did heartily agree with the sentence of the Lord, and

<P>a petition was forthwith drawn up for them.&nbsp; But now, who

<P>should carry it? that was next.&nbsp; But the Secretary advised

<P>that Captain Credence should carry it; for he was a well-

<P>spoken man.&nbsp; They therefore called for him, and propounded to

<P>him the business.&nbsp; 'Well,' said the captain, 'I gladly accept

<P>of the motion; and though I am lame, I will do this business

<P>for you with as much speed, and as well as I can.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The contents of the petition were to this purpose
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O our Lord, and Sovereign Prince Emmanuel, the potent, the

<P>long-suffering Prince! grace is poured into thy lips, and to

<P>thee belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled

<P>against thee.&nbsp; We, who are no more worthy to be called thy

<P>Mansoul, nor yet fit to partake of common benefits, do

<P>beseech thee, and thy Father by thee, to do away our

<P>transgressions.&nbsp; We confess that thou mightest cast us away

<P>for them; but do it not for thy name's sake: let the Lord

<P>rather take an opportunity, at our miserable condition, to

<P>let out his bowels and compassions to us.&nbsp; We are compassed

<P>on every side, Lord; our own backslidings reprove us; our

<P>Diabolonians within our town fright us; and the army of the

<P>angel of the bottomless pit distresses us.&nbsp; Thy grace can be

<P>our salvation, and whither to go but to thee we know not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Furthermore, O gracious Prince, we have weakened our

<P>captains, and they are discouraged, sick, and, of late, some

<P>of them grievously worsted and beaten out of the field by the

<P>power and force of the tyrant.&nbsp; Yea, even those of our

<P>captains, in whose valour we did formerly use to put most of

<P>our confidence, they are as wounded men.&nbsp; Besides, Lord, our

<P>enemies are lively, and they are strong; they vaunt and boast

<P>themselves, and do threaten to part us among themselves for a

<P>booty.&nbsp; They are fallen also upon us, Lord, with many

<P>thousand doubters, such as with whom we cannot tell what to

<P>do; they are all grim-looked and unmerciful ones, and they

<P>bid defiance to us and thee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Our wisdom is gone, our power is gone, because thou art

<P>departed from us; nor have we what we may call ours but sin,

<P>shame, and confusion of face for sin.&nbsp; Take pity upon us, O

<P>Lord, take pity upon us, thy miserable town of Mansoul, and

<P>save us out of the hands of our enemies.&nbsp; Amen.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This petition, as was touched afore, was handed by the Lord

<P>Secretary, and carried to the court by the brave and most

<P>stout Captain Credence.&nbsp; Now he carried it out at Mouth-gate,

<P>(for that, as I said, was the sally-port of the town,) and he

<P>went and came to Emmanuel with it.&nbsp; Now how it came out, I do

<P>not know; but for certain it did, and that so far as to reach

<P>the ears of Diabolus.&nbsp; Thus I conclude, because that the

<P>tyrant had it presently by the end, and charged the town of

<P>Mansoul with it, saying, 'Thou rebellious and stubborn-

<P>hearted Mansoul, I will make thee to leave off petitioning.

<P>Art thou yet for petitioning?&nbsp; I will make thee to leave.'

<P>Yea, he also knew who the messenger was that carried the

<P>petition to the Prince, and it made him both to fear and

<P>rage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore he commanded that his drum should be beat again, a

<P>thing that Mansoul could not abide to hear: but when Diabolus

<P>will have his drum beat, Mansoul must abide the noise.&nbsp; Well,

<P>the drum was beat, and the Diabolonians were gathered

<P>together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Diabolus, 'O ye stout Diabolonians, be it known

<P>unto you, that there is treachery hatched against us in the

<P>rebellious town of Mansoul; for albeit the town is in our

<P>possession, as you see, yet these miserable Mansoulians have

<P>attempted to dare, and have been so hardy as yet to send to

<P>the court to Emmanuel for help.&nbsp; This I give you to

<P>understand, that ye may yet know how to carry it to the

<P>wretched town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore, O my trusty

<P>Diabolonians, I command that yet more and more ye distress

<P>this town of Mansoul, and vex it with your wiles, ravish

<P>their women, deflower their virgins, slay their children,

<P>brain their ancients, fire their town, and what other

<P>mischief you can; and let this be the reward of the

<P>Mansoulians from me, for their desperate rebellions against

<P>me.'
