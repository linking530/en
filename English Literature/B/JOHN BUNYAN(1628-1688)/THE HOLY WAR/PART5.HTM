<P>HATE.&nbsp; My lord, I have heard this Forget-Good say, that he

<P>could never abide to think of goodness, no, not for a quarter

<P>of an hour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say so?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HATE.&nbsp; In All-base Lane, at a house next door to the sign of

<P>the Conscience seared with a hot iron.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Know-All, what can you say for our Lord the King

<P>against the prisoner at the bar?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, I know this man well.&nbsp; He is a Diabolonian,

<P>the son of a Diabolonian: his father's name was Love-Naught;

<P>and for him, I have often heard him say, that he counted the

<P>very thoughts of goodness the most burdensome thing in the

<P>world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where have you heard him say these words?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; In Flesh Lane, right opposite to the church.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Clerk, 'Come, Mr. Tell-True, give in your

<P>evidence concerning the prisoner at the bar, about that for

<P>which he stands here, as you see, indicted by this honourable

<P>Court.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; My lord, I have heard him often say he had rather

<P>think of the vilest thing than of what is contained in the

<P>Holy Scriptures.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say such grievous words?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; Where? - in a great many places, particularly in

<P>Nauseous Street, in the house of one Shameless, and in Filth

<P>Lane, at the sign of the Reprobate, next door to the Descent

<P>into the Pit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>COURT.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you have heard the indictment, his plea,

<P>and the testimony of the witnesses.&nbsp; Gaoler, set Mr. Hard-

<P>Heart to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He is set to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Hard-Heart, thou art here indicted by the name of

<P>Hard-Heart, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that

<P>thou didst most desperately and wickedly possess the town of

<P>Mansoul with impenitency and obdurateness; and didst keep

<P>them from remorse and sorrow for their evils, all the time of

<P>their apostacy from and rebellion against the blessed King

<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Art thou

<P>guilty, or not guilty?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HARD.&nbsp; My lord, I never knew what remorse or sorrow meant in

<P>all my life.&nbsp; I am impenetrable.&nbsp; I care for no man; nor can

<P>I be pierced with men's griefs; their groans will not enter

<P>into my heart.&nbsp; Whomsoever I mischief, whomsoever I wrong, to

<P>me it is music, when to others mourning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>COURT.&nbsp; You see the man is a right Diabolonian, and has

<P>convicted himself.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. False-

<P>Peace to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>False-Peace set to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. False-Peace, thou art here indicted by the name of

<P>False-Peace, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that

<P>thou didst most wickedly and satanically bring, hold, and

<P>keep the town of Mansoul, both in her apostacy and in her

<P>hellish rebellion, in a false, groundless, and dangerous

<P>peace, and damnable security, to the dishonour of the King,

<P>the transgression of his law, and the great damage of the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; What sayest thou?&nbsp; Art thou guilty of this

<P>indictment, or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. False-Peace: 'Gentlemen, and you now appointed

<P>to be my judges, I acknowledge that my name is Mr. Peace; but

<P>that my name is False-Peace I utterly deny.&nbsp; If your honours

<P>shall please to send for any that do intimately know me, or

<P>for the midwife that laid my mother of me, or for the gossips

<P>that were at my christening, they will, any or all of them,

<P>prove that my name is not False-Peace, but Peace.&nbsp; Wherefore

<P>I cannot plead to this indictment, forasmuch as my name is

<P>not inserted therein; and as is my true name, so are also my

<P>conditions.&nbsp; I was always a man that loved to live at quiet,

<P>and what I loved myself, that I thought others might love

<P>also.&nbsp; Wherefore, when I saw any of my neighbours to labour

<P>under a disquieted mind, I endeavoured to help them what I

<P>could; and instances of this good temper of mine many I could

<P>give; as,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'1. When, at the beginning, our town of Mansoul did decline

<P>the ways of Shaddai, they, some of them, afterwards began to

<P>have disquieting reflections upon themselves for what they

<P>had done; but I, as one troubled to see them disquieted,

<P>presently sought out means to get them quiet again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. When the ways of the old world, and of Sodom, were in

<P>fashion, if anything happened to molest those that were for

<P>the customs of the present times, I laboured to make them

<P>quiet again, and to cause them to act without molestation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. To come nearer home: when the wars fell out between

<P>Shaddai and Diabolus, if at any time I saw any of the town of

<P>Mansoul afraid of destruction, I often used, by some way,

<P>device, invention, or other, to labour to bring them to peace

<P>again.&nbsp; Wherefore, since I have been always a man of so

<P>virtuous a temper as some say a peace-maker is, and if a

<P>peace-maker be so deserving a man as some have been bold to

<P>attest he is, then let me, gentlemen, be accounted by you,

<P>who have a great name for justice and equity in Mansoul, for

<P>a man that deserveth not this inhuman way of treatment, but

<P>liberty, and also a license to seek damage of those that have

<P>been my accusers.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the clerk, 'Crier, make a proclamation.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CRIER.&nbsp; Oyes!&nbsp; Forasmuch as the prisoner at the bar hath

<P>denied his name to be that which is mentioned in the

<P>indictment, the Court requireth that if there be any in this

<P>place that can give information to the Court of the original

<P>and right name of the prisoner, they would come forth and

<P>give in their evidence; for the prisoner stands upon his own

<P>innocency.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then came two into the court, and desired that they might

<P>have leave to speak what they knew concerning the prisoner at

<P>the bar: the name of the one was Search-Truth, and the name

<P>of the other Vouch-Truth.&nbsp; So the Court demanded of these men

<P>if they knew the prisoner, and what they could say concerning

<P>him, 'for he stands,' said they, 'upon his own vindication.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Search-Truth, 'My Lord, I - '
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>COURT.&nbsp; Hold! give him his oath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they sware him.&nbsp; So he proceeded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>SEARCH.&nbsp; My lord, I know and have known this man from a

<P>child, and can attest that his name is False-Peace.&nbsp; I know

<P>his father; his name was Mr. Flatter: and his mother, before

<P>she was married, was called by the name of Mrs. Sooth-Up: and

<P>these two, when they came together, lived not long without

<P>this son; and when he was born, they called his name False-

<P>Peace.&nbsp; I was his play-fellow, only I was somewhat older than

<P>he; and when his mother did use to call him home from his

<P>play, she used to say, 'False-Peace, False-Peace, come home

<P>quick, or I'll fetch you.'&nbsp; Yea, I knew him when he sucked;

<P>and though I was then but little, yet I can remember that

<P>when his mother did use to sit at the door with him, or did

<P>play with him in her arms, she would call him, twenty times

<P>together, 'My little False-Peace! my pretty False-Peace!'

<P>and, 'Oh! my sweet rogue, False-Peace!' and again, 'Oh! my

<P>little bird, False-Peace!' and 'How do I love my child!'&nbsp; The

<P>gossips also know it is thus, though he has had the face to

<P>deny it in open court.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Mr. Vouch-Truth was called upon to speak what he knew of

<P>him.&nbsp; So they sware him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Vouch-Truth, 'My lord, all that the former

<P>witness hath said is true.&nbsp; His name is False-Peace, the son

<P>of Mr. Flatter, and of Mrs. Sooth-Up, his mother: and I have

<P>in former times seen him angry with those that have called

<P>him anything else but False-Peace, for he would say that all

<P>such did mock and nickname him; but this was in the time when

<P>Mr. False-Peace was a great man, and when the Diabolonians

<P>were the brave men in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>COURT.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you have heard what these two men have

<P>sworn against the prisoner at the bar.&nbsp; And now, Mr. False-

<P>Peace, to you: you have denied your name to be False-Peace,

<P>yet you see that these honest men have sworn that that is

<P>your name.&nbsp; As to your plea, in that you are quite besides

<P>the matter of your indictment, you are not by it charged for

<P>evil-doing because you are a man of peace, or a peace-maker

<P>among your neighbours; but for that you did wickedly and

<P>satanically bring, keep, and hold the town of Mansoul, both

<P>under its apostasy from, and in its rebellion against its

<P>King, in a false, lying, and damnable peace, contrary to the

<P>law of Shaddai, and to the hazard of the destruction of the

<P>then miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; All that you have pleaded

<P>for yourself is, that you have denied your name, etc.; but

<P>here, you see, we have witnesses to prove that you are the

<P>man.&nbsp; For the peace that you so much boast of making among

<P>your neighbours, know that peace that is not a companion of

<P>truth and holiness, but that which is without this

<P>foundation, is grounded upon a lie, and is both deceitful and

<P>damnable, as also the great Shaddai hath said.&nbsp; Thy plea,

<P>therefore, has not delivered thee from what by the indictment

<P>thou art charged with, but rather it doth fasten all upon

<P>thee.&nbsp; But thou shalt have very fair play.&nbsp; Let us call the

<P>witnesses that are to testify as to matter of fact, and see

<P>what they have to say for our Lord the King against the

<P>prisoner at the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Know-All, what say you for our Lord the King

<P>against the prisoner at the bar?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, this man hath of a long time made it, to my

<P>knowledge, his business to keep the town of Mansoul in a

<P>sinful quietness in the midst of all her lewdness,

<P>filthiness, and turmoils, and hath said, and that in my

<P>hearing, Come, come, let us fly from all trouble, on what

<P>ground soever it comes, and let us be for a quiet and

<P>peaceable life, though it wanteth a good foundation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Hate-Lies, what have you to say?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HATE.&nbsp; My lord, I have heard him say, that peace, though in a

<P>way of unrighteousness, is better than trouble with truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HATE.&nbsp; I heard him say it in Folly-yard, at the house of one

<P>Mr. Simple, next door to the sign of the Self-deceiver.&nbsp; Yea,

<P>he hath said this to my knowledge twenty times in that place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; We may spare further witness; this evidence is plain

<P>and full.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. No-Truth to the

<P>bar.&nbsp; Mr. No-Truth, thou art here indicted by the name of No-

<P>Truth, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou

<P>hast always, to the dishonour of Shaddai, and the endangering

<P>of the utter ruin of the famous town of Mansoul, set thyself

<P>to deface, and utterly to spoil, all the remainders of the

<P>law and image of Shaddai that have been found in Mansoul

<P>after her deep apostasy from her king to Diabolus, the

<P>envious tyrant.&nbsp; What sayest thou, art thou guilty of this

<P>indictment, or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>NO.&nbsp; Not guilty, my lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the witnesses were called, and Mr. Know-All did first

<P>give in his evidence against him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, this man was at the pulling down of the image

<P>of Shaddai; yea, this is he that did it with his own hands.

<P>I myself stood by and saw him do it, and he did it at the

<P>commandment of Diabolus.&nbsp; Yea, this Mr. No-Truth did more

<P>than this, he did also set up the horned image of the beast

<P>Diabolus in the same place.&nbsp; This also is he that, at the

<P>bidding of Diabolus, did rend and tear, and cause to be

<P>consumed, all that he could of the remainders of the law of

<P>the King, even whatever he could lay his hands on in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Who saw him do this besides yourself?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HATE.&nbsp; I did, my lord, and so did many more besides; for this

<P>was not done by stealth, or in a corner, but in the open view

<P>of all; yea, he chose himself to do it publicly, for he

<P>delighted in the doing of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. No-Truth, how could you have the face to plead

<P>not guilty, when you were so manifestly the doer of all this

<P>wickedness?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>NO.&nbsp; Sir, I thought I must say something, and as my name is,

<P>so I speak.&nbsp; I have been advantaged thereby before now, and

<P>did not know but by speaking no truth, I might have reaped

<P>the same benefit now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Pitiless to the bar.

<P>Mr. Pitiless, thou art here indicted by the name of Pitiless,

<P>(an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst

<P>most traitorously and wickedly shut up all bowels of

<P>compassion, and wouldest not suffer poor Mansoul to condole

<P>her own misery when she had apostatised from her rightful

<P>King, but didst evade, and at all times turn her mind awry

<P>from those thoughts that had in them a tendency to lead her

<P>to repentance.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Guilty

<P>or not guilty?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Not guilty of pitilessness: all I did was to cheer up,

<P>according to my name, for my name is not Pitiless, but Cheer-

<P>up; and I could not abide to see Mansoul inclined to

<P>melancholy.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; How! do you deny your name, and say it is not

<P>Pitiless, but Cheer-up? Call for the witnesses.&nbsp; What say

<P>you, the witnesses, to this plea?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, his name is Pitiless; so he hath written

<P>himself in all papers of concern wherein he has had to do.

<P>But these Diabolonians love to counterfeit their names: Mr.

<P>Covetousness covers himself with the name of Good-Husbandry,

<P>or the like; Mr. Pride can, when need is, call himself Mr.

<P>Neat, Mr. Handsome, or the like; and so of all the rest of

<P>them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Tell-True, what say you?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; His name is Pitiless, my lord.&nbsp; I have known him from

<P>a child, and he hath done all that wickedness whereof he

<P>stands charged in the indictment; but there is a company of

<P>them that are not acquainted with the danger of damning,

<P>therefore they call all those melancholy that have serious

<P>thoughts how that state should be shunned by them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Set Mr. Haughty to the bar, gaoler.&nbsp; Mr. Haughty,

<P>thou art here indicted by the name of Haughty, (an intruder

<P>upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst most

<P>traitorously and devilishly teach the town of Mansoul to

<P>carry it loftily and stoutly against the summons that was

<P>given them by the captains of the King Shaddai.&nbsp; Thou didst

<P>also teach the town of Mansoul to speak contemptuously and

<P>vilifyingly of their great King Shaddai; and didst moreover

<P>encourage, both by words and examples, Mansoul, to take up

<P>arms both against the King and his son Emmanuel.&nbsp; How sayest

<P>thou, art thou guilty of this indictment, or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HAUGHTY.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I have always been a man of courage and

<P>valour, and have not used, when under the greatest clouds, to

<P>sneak or hang down the head like a bulrush; nor did it at all

<P>at any time please me to see men veil their bonnets to those

<P>that have opposed them; yea, though their adversaries seemed

<P>to have ten times the advantage of them.&nbsp; I did not use to

<P>consider who was my foe, nor what the cause was in which I

<P>was engaged.&nbsp; It was enough to me if I carried it bravely,

<P>fought like a man, and came off a victor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>COURT.&nbsp; Mr. Haughty, you are not here indicted for that you

<P>have been a valiant man, nor for your courage and stoutness

<P>in times of distress, but for that you have made use of this

<P>your pretended valour to draw the town of Mansoul into acts

<P>of rebellion both against the great King, and Emmanuel his

<P>Son.&nbsp; This is the crime and the thing wherewith thou art

<P>charged in and by the indictment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he made no answer to that.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when the Court had thus far proceeded against the

<P>prisoners at the bar, then they put them over to the verdict

<P>of their jury, to whom they did apply themselves after this

<P>manner:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen of the jury, you have been here, and have seen

<P>these men; you have heard their indictments, their pleas, and

<P>what the witnesses have testified against them: now what

<P>remains, is, that you do forthwith withdraw yourselves to

<P>some place, where without confusion you may consider of what

<P>verdict, in a way of truth and righteousness, you ought to

<P>bring in for the King against them, and so bring it in

<P>accordingly.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the jury, to wit, Mr. Belief, Mr. True-Heart, Mr.

<P>Upright, Mr. Hate-bad, Mr. Love-God, Mr. See-Truth, Mr.

<P>Heavenly-Mind, Mr. Moderate, Mr. Thankful, Mr. Humble, Mr.

<P>Good-Work, and Mr. Zeal-for-God, withdrew themselves in order

<P>to their work.&nbsp; Now when they were shut up by themselves,

<P>they fell to discourse among themselves in order to the

<P>drawing up of their verdict.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And thus Mr. Belief (for he was the foreman) began:

<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'for the men, the prisoners at the

<P>bar, for my part I believe that they all deserve death.'

<P>'Very right,' said Mr. True-Heart; 'I am wholly of your

<P>opinion.'&nbsp; 'Oh what a mercy is it,' said Mr. Hate-Bad, 'that

<P>such villains as these are apprehended!'&nbsp; 'Ay! ay!' said Mr.

<P>Love-God, 'this is one of the joyfullest days that ever I saw

<P>in my life.'&nbsp; Then said Mr. See-Truth, 'I know that if we

<P>judge them to death, our verdict shall stand before Shaddai

<P>himself'&nbsp; 'Nor do I at all question it,' said Mr. Heavenly-

<P>Mind; he said, moreover, 'When all such beasts as these are

<P>cast out of Mansoul, what a goodly town will it be then!'

<P>'Then,' said Mr. Moderate, 'it is not my manner to pass my

<P>judgment with rashness; but for these their crimes are so

<P>notorious, and the witness so palpable, that that man must be

<P>wilfully blind who saith the prisoners ought not to die.'

<P>'Blessed be God,' said Mr. Thankful, 'that the traitors are

<P>in safe custody.'&nbsp; 'And I join with you in this upon my bare

<P>knees,' said Mr. Humble.&nbsp; 'I am glad also,' said Mr. Good-

<P>Work.&nbsp; Then said the warm man, and true-hearted Mr. Zeal-for-

<P>God, 'Cut them off; they have been the plague, and have

<P>sought the destruction of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus, therefore, being all agreed in their verdict, they come

<P>instantly into the Court.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Gentlemen of the jury, answer all to your names: Mr.

<P>Belief, one; Mr. True-Heart, two; Mr. Upright, three; Mr.

<P>JURY.&nbsp; Our foreman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; You, the gentlemen of the jury, being empannelled for

<P>our Lord the King, to serve here in a matter of life and

<P>death, have heard the trials of each of these men, the

<P>prisoners at the bar: what say you? are they guilty of that,

<P>and those crimes for which they stand here indicted, or are

<P>they not guilty?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FOREMAN.&nbsp; Guilty, my lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Look to your prisoners, gaoler.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was done in the morning, and in the afternoon they

<P>received the sentence of death according to the law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The gaoler, therefore, having received such a charge, put

<P>them all in the inward prison, to preserve them there till

<P>the day of execution, which was to be the next day in the

<P>morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now to see how it happened, one of the prisoners,

<P>Incredulity by name, in the interim betwixt the sentence and

<P>the time of execution, brake prison and made his escape, and

<P>gets him away quite out of the town of Mansoul, and lay

<P>lurking in such places and holes as he might, until he should

<P>again have opportunity to do the town of Mansoul a mischief

<P>for their thus handling of him as they did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when Mr. Trueman, the gaoler, perceived that he had lost

<P>his prisoner, he was in a heavy taking, because that prisoner

<P>was, to speak on, the very worst of all the gang: wherefore

<P>first he goes and acquaints my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and

<P>my Lord Willbewill, with the matter, and to get of them an

<P>order to make search for him throughout the town of Mansoul.

<P>So an order he got, and search was made, but no such man

<P>could now be found in all the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All that could be gathered was, that he had lurked a while

<P>about the outside of the town, and that here and there one or

<P>other had a glimpse of him as he did make his escape out of

<P>Mansoul; one or two also did affirm that they saw him without

<P>the town, going apace quite over the plain.&nbsp; Now when he was

<P>quite gone, it was affirmed by one Mr. Did-see, that he

<P>ranged all over dry places, till he met with Diabolus, his

<P>friend, and where should they meet one another but just upon

<P>Hell-gate hill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But oh! what a lamentable story did the old gentleman tell to

<P>Diabolus concerning what sad alteration Emmanuel had made in

<P>Mansoul!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As, first, how Mansoul had, after some delays, received a

<P>general pardon at the hands of Emmanuel, and that they had

<P>invited him into the town, and that they had given him the

<P>castle for his possession.&nbsp; He said, moreover, that they had

<P>called his soldiers into the town, coveted who should quarter

<P>the most of them; they also entertained him with the timbrel,

<P>song, and dance.&nbsp; 'But that,' said Incredulity, 'which is the

<P>sorest vexation to me is, that he hath pulled down, O father,

<P>thy image, and set up his own; pulled down thy officers and

<P>set up his own.&nbsp; Yea, and Willbewill, that rebel, who, one

<P>would have thought, should never have turned from us, he is

<P>now in as great favour with Emmanuel as ever he was with

<P>thee.&nbsp; But, besides all this, this Willbewill has received a

<P>special commission from his master to search for, to

<P>apprehend, and to put to death all, and all manner of

<P>Diabolonians that he shall find in Mansoul: yea, and this

<P>Willbewill has taken and committed to prison already eight of

<P>my Lord's most trusty friends in Mansoul.&nbsp; Nay, further, my

<P>Lord, with grief I speak it, they have been all arraigned,

<P>condemned, and, I doubt, before this executed in Mansoul.&nbsp; I

<P>told my Lord of eight, and myself was the ninth, who should

<P>assuredly have drunk of the same cup, but that through craft,

<P>I, as thou seest, have made mine escape from them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus had heard this lamentable story, he yelled and

<P>snuffed up the wind like a dragon, and made the sky to look

<P>dark with his roaring; he also sware that he would try to be

<P>revenged on Mansoul for this.&nbsp; So they, both he and his old

<P>friend Incredulity, concluded to enter into great

<P>consultation, how they might get the town of Mansoul again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, before this time, the day was come in which the

<P>prisoners in Mansoul were to be executed.&nbsp; So they were

<P>brought to the cross, and that by Mansoul, in most solemn

<P>manner; for the Prince said that this should be done by the

<P>hand of the town of Mansoul, 'that I may see,' said he, 'the

<P>forwardness of my now redeemed Mansoul to keep my word, and

<P>to do my commandments; and that I may bless Mansoul in doing

<P>this deed.&nbsp; Proof of sincerity pleases me well; let Mansoul

<P>therefore first lay their hands upon these Diabolonians to

<P>destroy them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the town of Mansoul slew them, according to the word of

<P>their Prince; but when the prisoners were brought to the

<P>cross to die, you can hardly believe what troublesome work

<P>Mansoul had of it to put the Diabolonians to death; for the

<P>men, knowing that they must die, and every of them having

<P>implacable enmity in their hearts to Mansoul, what did they

<P>but took courage at the cross, and there resisted the men of

<P>the town of Mansoul?&nbsp; Wherefore the men of Mansoul were

<P>forced to cry out for help to the captains and men of war.

<P>Now the great Shaddai had a secretary in the town, and he was

<P>a great lover of the men of Mansoul, and he was at the place

<P>of execution also; so he, hearing the men of Mansoul cry out

<P>against the strugglings and unruliness of the prisoners, rose

<P>up from his place, and came and put his hands upon the hands

<P>of the men of Mansoul.&nbsp; So they crucified the Diabolonians

<P>that had been a plague, a grief, and an offence to the town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when this good work was done, the Prince came down to

<P>see, to visit, and to speak comfortably to the men of

<P>Mansoul, and to strengthen their hands in such work.&nbsp; And he

<P>said to them that, by this act of theirs he had proved them,

<P>and found them to be lovers of his person, observers of his

<P>laws, and such as had also respect to his honour.&nbsp; He said,

<P>moreover, (to show them that they by this should not be

<P>losers, nor their town weakened by the loss of them,) that he

<P>would make them another captain, and that of one of

<P>themselves.&nbsp; And that this captain should be the ruler of a

<P>thousand, for the good and benefit of the now flourishing

<P>town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he called one to him whose name was Waiting, and bid him,

<P>'Go quickly up to the castle gate, and inquire there for one

<P>Mr. Experience, that waiteth upon that noble captain, the

<P>Captain Credence, and bid him come hither to me.'&nbsp; So the

<P>messenger that waited upon the good Prince Emmanuel went and

<P>said as he was commanded.&nbsp; Now the young gentleman was

<P>waiting to see the captain train and muster his men in the

<P>castle yard.&nbsp; Then said Mr. Waiting to him, 'Sir, the Prince

<P>would that you should come down to his highness forthwith.'

<P>So he brought him down to Emmanuel, and he came and made

<P>obeisance before him.&nbsp; Now the men of the town knew Mr.

<P>Experience well, for he was born and bred in Mansoul; they

<P>also knew him to be a man of conduct, of valour, and a person

<P>prudent in matters; he was also a comely person, well-spoken,

<P>and very successful in his undertakings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore the hearts of the townsmen were transported with

<P>joy when they saw that the Prince himself was so taken with

<P>Mr. Experience, that he would needs make him a captain over a

<P>band of men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So with one consent they bowed the knee before Emmanuel, and

<P>with a shout said, 'Let Emmanuel live for ever!'&nbsp; Then said

<P>the Prince to the young gentleman, whose name was Mr.

<P>Experience, 'I have thought good to confer upon thee a place

<P>of trust and honour in this my town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; Then the

<P>young man bowed his head and worshipped.&nbsp; 'It is,' said

<P>Emmanuel, 'that thou shouldest be a captain, a captain over a

<P>thousand men in my beloved town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; Then said the

<P>captain, 'Let the King live!'&nbsp; So the Prince gave out orders

<P>forthwith to the King's secretary, that he should draw up for

<P>Mr. Experience a commission to make him a captain over a

<P>thousand men.&nbsp; 'And let it be brought to me,' said he, 'that

<P>I may set to my seal.'&nbsp; So it was done as it was commanded.

<P>The commission was drawn up, brought to Emmanuel, and he set

<P>his seal thereto.&nbsp; Then, by the hand of Mr. Waiting, he sent

<P>it away to the captain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now as soon as the captain had received his commission, he

<P>sounded his trumpet for volunteers, and young men came to him

<P>apace; yea, the greatest and chief men in the town sent their

<P>sons, to be listed under his command.&nbsp; Thus Captain

<P>Experience came under command to Emmanuel, for the good of

<P>the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He had for his lieutenant one Mr.

<P>Skilful, and for his cornet one Mr. Memory.&nbsp; His under

<P>officers I need not name.&nbsp; His colours were the white colours

<P>for the town of Mansoul; and his scutcheon was the dead lion

<P>and dead bear.&nbsp; So the Prince returned to his royal palace

<P>again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when he was returned thither, the elders of the town of

<P>Mansoul, to wit, the Lord Mayor, the Recorder, and the Lord

<P>Willbewill, went to congratulate him, and in special way to

<P>thank him for his love, care, and the tender compassion which

<P>he showed to his ever-obliged town of Mansoul.&nbsp; So after a

<P>while, and some sweet communion between them, the townsmen

<P>having solemnly ended their ceremony, returned to their place

<P>again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emmanuel also at this time appointed them a day wherein he

<P>would renew their charter, yea, wherein he would renew and

<P>enlarge it, mending several faults therein, that Mansoul's

<P>yoke might be yet more easy.&nbsp; And this he did without any

<P>desire of theirs, even of his own frankness and noble mind.

<P>So when he had sent for and seen their old one, he laid it

<P>by, and said, 'Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is

<P>ready to vanish away.'&nbsp; He said, moreover, 'The town of

<P>Mansoul shall have another, a better, a new one, more steady

<P>and firm by far.'&nbsp; An epitome hereof take as follows:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Emmanuel, Prince of Peace, and a great lover of the town of

<P>Mansoul, I do in the name of my Father, and of mine own

<P>clemency, give, grant, and bequeath to my beloved town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First.&nbsp; Free, full, and everlasting forgiveness of all

<P>wrongs, injuries, and offences done by them against my

<P>Father, me, their neighbour, or themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Second.&nbsp; I do give them the holy law and my testament, with

<P>all that therein is contained, for their everlasting comfort

<P>and consolation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Third.&nbsp; I do also give them a portion of the self-same grace

<P>and goodness that dwells in my Father's heart and mine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Fourth.&nbsp; I do give, grant, and bestow upon them freely, the

<P>world and what is therein, for their good; and they shall

<P>have that power over them, as shall stand with the honour of

<P>my Father, my glory, and their comfort: yea, I grant them the

<P>benefits of life and death, and of things present, and things

<P>to come.&nbsp; This privilege no other city, town, or corporation,

<P>shall have, but my Mansoul only.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Fifth.&nbsp; I do give and grant them leave, and free access to

<P>me in my palace at all seasons - to my palace above or below

<P>- there to make known their wants to me, and I give them,

<P>moreover, a promise that I will hear and redress all their

<P>grievances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Sixth.&nbsp; I do give, grant to, and invest the town of Mansoul

<P>with full power and authority to seek out, take, enslave, and

<P>destroy all, and all manner of Diabolonians that at any time,

<P>from whencesoever, shall be found straggling in or about the

<P>town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Seventh.&nbsp; I do further grant to my beloved town of Mansoul,

<P>that they shall have authority not to suffer any foreigner,

<P>or stranger, or their seed, to be free in, and of the blessed

<P>town of Mansoul, nor to share in the excellent privileges

<P>thereof.&nbsp; But that all the grants, privileges, and immunities

<P>that I bestow upon the famous town of Mansoul, shall be for

<P>those the old natives, and true inhabitants thereof; to them,

<P>I say, and to their right seed after them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But all Diabolonians, of what sort, birth, country, or

<P>kingdom soever, shall be debarred a share therein.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when the town of Mansoul had received at the hand of

<P>Emmanuel their gracious charter, (which in itself is

<P>infinitely more large than by this lean epitome is set before

<P>you,) they carried it to audience, that is, to the market

<P>place, and there Mr. Recorder read it in the presence of all

<P>the people.&nbsp; This being done, it was had back to the castle

<P>gates, and there fairly engraven upon the doors thereof, and

<P>laid in letters of gold, to the end that the town of Mansoul,

<P>with all the people thereof, might have it always in their

<P>view, or might go where they might see what a blessed freedom

<P>their Prince had bestowed upon them, that their joy might be

<P>increased in themselves, and their love renewed to their

<P>great and good Emmanuel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But what joy, what comfort, what consolation, think you, did

<P>now possess the hearts of the men of Mansoul!&nbsp; The bells

<P>rung, the minstrels played, the people danced, the captains

<P>shouted, the colours waved in the wind, and the silver

<P>trumpets sounded; and the Diabolonians now were glad to hide

<P>their heads, for they looked like them that had been long

<P>dead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this was over, the Prince sent again for the elders of

<P>the town of Mansoul, and communed with them about a ministry

<P>that he intended to establish among them; such a ministry

<P>that might open unto them, and that might instruct them in

<P>the things that did concern their present and future state.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'For,' said he, 'you, of yourselves, unless you have teachers

<P>and guides, will not be able to know, and, if not to know, to

<P>be sure not to do the will of my Father.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this news, when the elders of Mansoul brought it to the

<P>people, the whole town came running together, (for it pleased

<P>them well, as whatever the Prince now did pleased the

<P>people,) and all with one consent implored his Majesty that

<P>he would forthwith establish such a ministry among them as

<P>might teach them both law and judgment, statute and

<P>commandment; that they might be documented in all good and

<P>wholesome things.&nbsp; So he told them that he would grant them

<P>their requests, and would establish two among them; one that

<P>was of his Father's court, and one that was a native of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'He that is from the court,' said he, 'is a person of no less

<P>quality and dignity than my Father and I; and he is the Lord

<P>Chief Secretary of my Father's house: for he is, and always

<P>has been, the chief dictator of all my Father's laws, a

<P>person altogether well skilled in all mysteries, and

<P>knowledge of mysteries, as is my Father, or as myself is.

<P>Indeed he is one with us in nature, and also as to loving of,

<P>and being faithful to, and in the eternal concerns of the

<P>town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And this is he,' said the Prince, 'that must be your chief

<P>teacher; for it is he, and he only, that can teach you

<P>clearly in all high and supernatural things.&nbsp; He, and he

<P>only, it is that knows the ways and methods of my Father at

<P>court, nor can any like him show how the heart of my Father

<P>is at all times, in all things, upon all occasions, towards

<P>Mansoul; for as no man knows the things of a man but that

<P>spirit of a man which is in him, so the things of my Father

<P>knows no man but this his high and mighty Secretary.&nbsp; Nor can

<P>any, as he, tell Mansoul how and what they shall do to keep

<P>themselves in the love of my Father.&nbsp; He also it is that can

<P>bring lost things to your remembrance, and that can tell you

<P>things to come.&nbsp; This teacher, therefore, must of necessity

<P>have the pre-eminence, both in your affections and judgment,

<P>before your other teacher; his personal dignity, the

<P>excellency of his teaching, also the great dexterity that he

<P>hath to help you to make and draw up petitions to my Father

<P>for your help, and to his pleasing, must lay obligations upon

<P>you to love him, fear him, and to take heed that you grieve

<P>him not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'This person can put life and vigour into all he says; yea,

<P>and can also put it into your heart.&nbsp; This person can make

<P>seers of you, and can make you tell what shall be hereafter.

<P>By this person you must frame all your petitions to my Father

<P>and me; and without his advice and counsel first obtained,

<P>let nothing enter into the town or castle of Mansoul, for

<P>that may disgust and grieve this noble person.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Take heed, I say, that you do not grieve this minister; for

<P>if you do, he may fight against you; and should he once be

<P>moved by you to set himself against you in battle array, that

<P>will distress you more than if twelve legions should from my

<P>Father's court be sent to make war upon you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, as I said, if you shall hearken unto him, and shall

<P>love him; if you shall devote yourselves to his teaching, and

<P>shall seek to have converse, and to maintain communion with

<P>him, you shall find him ten times better than is the whole

<P>world to any; yea, he will shed abroad the love of my Father

<P>in your hearts, and Mansoul will be the wisest, and most

<P>blessed of all people.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then did the Prince call unto him the old gentleman, who

<P>before had been the Recorder of Mansoul, Mr. Conscience by

<P>name, and told him, That, forasmuch as he was well skilled in

<P>the law and government of the town of Mansoul, and was also

<P>well-spoken, and could pertinently deliver to them his

<P>Master's will in all terrene and domestic matters, therefore

<P>he would also make him a minister for, in, and to the goodly

<P>town of Mansoul, in all the laws, statutes, and judgments of

<P>the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'And thou must,' said the

<P>Prince, 'confine thyself to the teaching of moral virtues, to

<P>civil and natural duties; but thou must not attempt to

<P>presume to be a revealer of those high and supernatural

<P>mysteries that are kept close in the bosom of Shaddai, my

<P>Father: for those things knows no man, nor can any reveal

<P>them but my Father's Secretary only.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou art a native of the town of Mansoul, but the Lord

<P>Secretary is a native with my Father; wherefore, as thou hast

<P>knowledge of the laws and customs of the corporation, so he

<P>of the things and will of my Father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Wherefore, O Mr. Conscience, although I have made thee a

<P>minister and a preacher to the town of Mansoul, yet as to the

<P>things which the Lord Secretary knoweth, and shall teach to

<P>this people, there thou must be his scholar and a learner,

<P>even as the rest of Mansoul are.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou must therefore, in all high and supernatural things, go

<P>to him for information and knowledge; for though there be a

<P>spirit in man, this person's inspiration must give him

<P>understanding.&nbsp; Wherefore, O thou Mr. Recorder, keep low and

<P>be humble, and remember that the Diabolonians that kept not

<P>their first charge, but left their own standing, are now made

<P>prisoners in the pit.&nbsp; Be therefore content with thy station.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I have made thee my Father's vicegerent on earth, in such

<P>things of which I have made mention before: and thou, take

<P>thou power to teach them to Mansoul, yea, and to impose them

<P>with whips and chastisements, if they shall not willingly

<P>hearken to do thy commandments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And, Mr. Recorder, because thou art old, and through many

<P>abuses made feeble; therefore I give thee leave and license

<P>to go when thou wilt to my fountain, my conduit, and there to

<P>drink freely of the blood of my grape, for my conduit doth

<P>always run wine.&nbsp; Thus doing, thou shalt drive from thine

<P>heart and stomach all foul, gross, and hurtful humours.&nbsp; It

<P>will also lighten thine eyes, and will strengthen thy memory

<P>for the reception and keeping of all that the King's most

<P>noble Secretary teacheth.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the Prince had thus put Mr. Recorder (that once so was)

<P>into the place and office of a minister to Mansoul, and the

<P>man had thankfully accepted thereof, then did Emmanuel

<P>address himself in a particular speech to the townsmen

<P>themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Behold,' said the Prince to Mansoul, 'my love and care

<P>towards you; I have added to all that is past, this mercy, to

<P>appoint you preachers; the most noble Secretary to teach you

<P>in all high and sublime mysteries; and this gentleman,'

<P>pointing to Mr. Conscience, 'is to teach you in all things

<P>human and domestic, for therein lieth his work.&nbsp; He is not,

<P>by what I have said, debarred of telling to Mansoul anything

<P>that he hath heard and received at the mouth of the lord high

<P>Secretary; only he shall not attempt to presume to pretend to

<P>be a revealer of those high mysteries himself; for the

<P>breaking of them up, and the discovery of them to Mansoul

<P>lieth only in the power, authority, and skill of the lord

<P>high Secretary himself.&nbsp; Talk of them he may, and so may the

<P>rest of the town of Mansoul; yea, and may, as occasion gives

<P>them opportunity, press them upon each other for the benefit

<P>of the whole.&nbsp; These things, therefore, I would have you

<P>observe and do, for it is for your life, and the lengthening

<P>of your days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And one thing more to my beloved Mr. Recorder, and to all

<P>the town of Mansoul: You must not dwell in, nor stay upon,

<P>anything of that which he hath in commission to teach you, as

<P>to your trust and expectation of the next world; (of the next

<P>world, I say, for I purpose to give another to Mansoul, when

<P>this with them is worn out;) but for that you must wholly and

<P>solely have recourse to, and make stay upon his doctrine that

<P>is your Teacher after the first order.&nbsp; Yea, Mr. Recorder

<P>himself must not look for life from that which he himself

<P>revealeth; his dependence for that must be founded in the

<P>doctrine of the other preacher.&nbsp; Let Mr. Recorder also take

<P>heed that he receive not any doctrine, or point of doctrine,

<P>that is not communicated to him by his Superior Teacher, nor

<P>yet within the precincts of his own formal knowledge.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, after the Prince had thus settled things in the famous

<P>town of Mansoul, he proceeded to give to the elders of the

<P>corporation a necessary caution, to wit, how they should

<P>carry it to the high and noble captains that he had, from his

<P>Father's court, sent or brought with him, to the famous town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'These captains,' said he, 'do love the town of Mansoul, and

<P>they are picked men, picked out of abundance, as men that

<P>best suit, and that will most faithfully serve in the wars of

<P>Shaddai against the Diabolonians, for the preservation of the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'I charge you therefore,' said he, 'O ye

<P>inhabitants of the now flourishing town of Mansoul, that you

<P>carry it not ruggedly or untowardly to my captains, or their

<P>men; since, as I said, they are picked and choice men - men

<P>chosen out of many for the good of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I

<P>say, I charge you, that you carry it not untowardly to them:

<P>for though they have the hearts and faces of lions, when at

<P>any time they shall be called forth to engage and fight with

<P>the King's foes, and the enemies of the town of Mansoul; yet

<P>a little discountenance cast upon them from the town of

<P>Mansoul will deject and cast down their faces, will weaken

<P>and take away their courage.&nbsp; Do not, therefore, O my

<P>beloved, carry it unkindly to my valiant captains and

<P>courageous men of war, but love them, nourish them, succour

<P>them, and lay them in your bosoms; and they will not only

<P>fight for you, but cause to fly from you all those the

<P>Diabolonians that seek, and will, if possible, be, your utter

<P>destruction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'If, therefore, any of them should at any time be sick or

<P>weak, and so not able to perform that office of love, which,

<P>with all their hearts, they are willing to do (and will do

<P>also when well and in health), slight them not, nor despise

<P>them, but rather strengthen them and encourage them, though

<P>weak and ready to die, for they are your fence, and your

<P>guard, your wall, your gates, your locks, and your bars.&nbsp; And

<P>although, when they are weak, they can do but little, but

<P>rather need to be helped by you, than that you should then

<P>expect great things from them, yet, when well, you know what

<P>exploits, what feats and warlike achievements they are able

<P>to do, and will perform for you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Besides, if they be weak, the town of Mansoul cannot be

<P>strong; if they be strong, then Mansoul cannot be weak; your

<P>safety, therefore, doth lie in their health, and in your

<P>countenancing them.&nbsp; Remember, also, that if they be sick,

<P>they catch that disease of the town of Mansoul itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'These things I have said unto you because I love your

<P>welfare and your honour: observe, therefore, O my Mansoul, to

<P>be punctual in all things that I have given in charge unto

<P>you, and that not only as a town corporate, and so to your

<P>officers and guard, and guides in chief, but to you as you

<P>are a people whose well-being, as single persons, depends on

<P>the observation of the orders and commandments of their Lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Next, O my Mansoul, I do warn you of that, of which,

<P>notwithstanding that reformation that at present is wrought

<P>among you, you have need to be warned about: wherefore

<P>hearken diligently unto me.&nbsp; I am now sure, and you will know

<P>hereafter, that there are yet of the Diabolonians remaining

<P>in the town of Mansoul, Diabolonians that are sturdy and

<P>implacable, and that do already while I am with you, and that

<P>will yet more when I am from you, study, plot, contrive,

<P>invent, and jointly attempt to bring you to desolation, and

<P>so to a state far worse than that of the Egyptian bondage;

<P>they are the avowed friends of Diabolus, therefore look about

<P>you.&nbsp; They used heretofore to lodge with their Prince in the

<P>Castle, when Incredulity was the Lord Mayor of this town; but

<P>since my coming hither, they lie more in the outsides and

<P>walls, and have made themselves dens, and caves, and holes,

<P>and strongholds therein.&nbsp; Wherefore, O Mansoul! thy work, as

<P>to this, will be so much the more difficult and hard; that

<P>is, to take, mortify, and put them to death according to the

<P>will of my Father.&nbsp; Nor can you utterly rid yourselves of

<P>them, unless you should pull down the walls of your town, the

<P>which I am by no means willing you should.&nbsp; Do you ask me,

<P>What shall we do then?&nbsp; Why, be you diligent, and quit you

<P>like men; observe their holes; find out their haunts; assault

<P>them, and make no peace with them.&nbsp; Wherever they haunt,

<P>lurk, or abide, and what terms of peace soever they offer

<P>you, abhor, and all shall be well betwixt you and me.&nbsp; And

<P>that you may the better know them from those that are the

<P>natives of Mansoul, I will give you this brief schedule of

<P>the names of the chief of them; and they are these that

<P>follow:- The Lord Fornication, the Lord Adultery, the Lord

<P>Murder, the Lord Anger, the Lord Lasciviousness, the Lord

<P>Deceit, the Lord Evil-Eye, Mr. Drunkenness, Mr. Revelling,

<P>Mr. Idolatry, Mr. Witch-craft, Mr. Variance, Mr. Emulation,

<P>Mr. Wrath, Mr. Strife, Mr. Sedition, and Mr. Heresy.&nbsp; These

<P>are some of the chief, O Mansoul! of those that will seek to

<P>overthrow thee for ever.&nbsp; These, I say, are the skulkers in

<P>Mansoul; but look thou well into the law of thy King, and

<P>there thou shalt find their physiognomy, and such other

<P>characteristical notes of them, by which they certainly may

<P>be known.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'These, O my Mansoul, (and I would gladly that you should

<P>certainly know it,) if they be suffered to run and range

<P>about the town as they would, will quickly, like vipers, eat

<P>out your bowels; yea, poison your captains, cut the sinews of

<P>your soldiers, break the bars and bolts of your gates, and

<P>turn your now most flourishing Mansoul into a barren and

<P>desolate wilderness, and ruinous heap.&nbsp; Wherefore, that you

<P>may take courage to yourselves to apprehend these villains

<P>wherever you find them, I give to you, my Lord Mayor, my Lord

<P>Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder, with all the inhabitants of the

<P>town of Mansoul, full power and commission to seek out, to

<P>take, and to cause to be put to death by the cross, all, and

<P>all manner of Diabolonians, when and wherever you shall find

<P>them to lurk within, or to range without the walls of the

<P>town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I told you before that I had placed a standing ministry

<P>among you; not that you have but these with you, for my first

<P>four captains who came against the master and lord of the

<P>Diabolonians that was in Mansoul, they can, and if need be,

<P>and if they be required, will not only privately inform, but

<P>publicly preach to the corporation both good and wholesome

<P>doctrine, and such as shall lead you in the way.&nbsp; Yea, they

<P>will set up a weekly, yea, if need be, a daily lecture in

<P>thee, O Mansoul! and will instruct thee in such profitable

<P>lessons, that, if heeded, will do thee good at the end.&nbsp; And

<P>take good heed that you spare not the men that you have a

<P>commission to take and crucify.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, as I have set before your eyes the vagrants and

<P>runagates by name, so I will tell you, that among yourselves,

<P>some of them shall creep in to beguile you, even such as

<P>would seem, and that in appearance are, very rife and hot for

<P>religion.&nbsp; And they, if you watch not, will do you a

<P>mischief, such an one as at present you cannot think of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'These, as I said, will show themselves to you in another hue

<P>than those under description before.&nbsp; Wherefore, Mansoul,

<P>watch and be sober, and suffer not thyself to be betrayed.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the Prince had thus far new modelled the town of

<P>Mansoul, and had instructed them in such matters as were

<P>profitable for them to know, then he appointed another day in

<P>which he intended, when the townsfolk came together, to

<P>bestow a further badge of honour upon the town of Mansoul, -

<P>a badge that should distinguish them from all the people,

<P>kindreds, and tongues that dwell in the kingdom of Universe.

<P>Now it was not long before the day appointed was come, and

<P>the Prince and his people met in the King's palace, where

<P>first Emmanuel made a short speech unto them, and then did

<P>for them as he had said, and unto them as he had promised.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'My Mansoul,' said he, 'that which I now am about to do, is

<P>to make you known to the world to be mine, and to distinguish

<P>you also in your own eyes, from all false traitors that may

<P>creep in among you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he commanded that those that waited upon him should go

<P>and bring forth out of his treasury those white and

<P>glistening robes 'that I,' said he, 'have provided and laid

<P>up in store for my Mansoul.'&nbsp; So the white garments were

<P>fetched out of his treasury, and laid forth to the eyes of

<P>the people.&nbsp; Moreover, it was granted to them that they

<P>should take them and put them on, 'according,' said he, 'to

<P>your size and stature.'&nbsp; So the people were put into white,

<P>into fine linen, white and clean.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Prince unto them, 'This, O Mansoul, is my

<P>livery, and the badge by which mine are known from the

<P>servants of others.&nbsp; Yea, it is that which I grant to all

<P>that are mine, and without which no man is permitted to see

<P>my face.&nbsp; Wear them, therefore, for my sake, who gave them

<P>unto you; and also if you would be known by the world to be

<P>mine.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now! can you think how Mansoul shone?&nbsp; It was fair as the

<P>sun, clear as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Prince added further, and said, 'No prince, potentate, or

<P>mighty one of Universe, giveth this livery but myself:

<P>behold, therefore, as I said before, you shall be known by it

<P>to be mine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And now,' said he, 'I have given you my livery, let me give

<P>you also in commandment concerning them; and be sure that you

<P>take good heed to my words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First.&nbsp; Wear them daily, day by day, lest you should at

<P>sometimes appear to others as if you were none of mine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Second.&nbsp; Keep them always white; for if they be soiled, it

<P>is dishonour to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Third.&nbsp; Wherefore gird them up from the ground, and let them

<P>not lag with dust and dirt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Fourth.&nbsp; Take heed that you lose them not, lest you walk

<P>naked, and they see your shame.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Fifth.&nbsp; But if you should sully them, if you should defile

<P>them, the which I am greatly unwilling you should, and the

<P>prince Diabolus will be glad if you would, then speed you to

<P>do that which is written in my law, that yet you may stand,

<P>and befall before me, and before my throne.&nbsp; Also, this is

<P>the way to cause that I may not leave you, nor forsake you

<P>while here, but may dwell in this town of Mansoul for ever.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now was Mansoul, and the inhabitants of it, as the signet

<P>upon Emmanuel's right hand.&nbsp; Where was there now a town, a

<P>city, a corporation, that could compare with Mansoul! a town

<P>redeemed from the hand, and from the power of Diabolus! a

<P>town that the King Shaddai loved, and that he sent Emmanuel

<P>to regain from the Prince of the infernal cave; yea, a town

<P>that Emmanuel loved to dwell in, and that he chose for his

<P>royal habitation; a town that he fortified for himself, and

<P>made strong by the force of his army.&nbsp; What shall I say,

<P>Mansoul has now a most excellent Prince, golden captains and

<P>men of war, weapons proved, and garments as white as snow.

<P>Nor are these benefits to be counted little, but great; can

<P>the town of Mansoul esteem them so, and improve them to that

<P>end and purpose for which they are bestowed upon them?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the Prince had thus completed the modelling of the town,

<P>to show that he had great delight in the work of his hands

<P>and took pleasure in the good that he had wrought for the

<P>famous and flourishing Mansoul, he commanded, and they set

<P>his standard upon the battlements of the castle.&nbsp; And then,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First.&nbsp; He gave them frequent visits; not a day now but the

<P>elders of Mansoul must come to him, or he to them, into his

<P>palace.&nbsp; Now they must walk and talk together of all the

<P>great things that he had done, and yet further promised to

<P>do, for the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thus would he often do with the

<P>Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and the honest subordinate

<P>preacher Mr. Conscience, and Mr. Recorder.&nbsp; But oh, how

<P>graciously, how lovingly, how courteously, and tenderly did

<P>this blessed Prince now carry it towards the town of Mansoul!

<P>In all the streets, gardens, orchards, and other places where

<P>he came, to be sure the poor should have his blessing and

<P>benediction; yea, he would kiss them, and if they were ill he

<P>would lay hands on them, and make them well.&nbsp; The captains,

<P>also, he would daily, yea, sometimes hourly, encourage with

<P>his presence and goodly words.&nbsp; For you must know that a

<P>smile from him upon them would put more vigour, more life,

<P>and stoutness into them, than would anything else under

<P>heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Prince would now also feast them, and be with them

<P>continually: hardly a week would pass but a banquet must be

<P>had betwixt him and them.&nbsp; You may remember that, some pages

<P>before, we make mention of one feast that they had together;

<P>but now to feast them was a thing more common: every day with

<P>Mansoul was a feast-day now.&nbsp; Nor did he, when they returned

<P>to their places, send them empty away, either they must have

<P>a ring, a gold chain, a bracelet, a white stone, or

<P>something; so dear was Mansoul to him now; so lovely was

<P>Mansoul in his eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Second.&nbsp; When the elders and townsmen did not come to him, he

<P>would send in much plenty of provision unto them; meat that

<P>came from court, wine and bread that were prepared for his

<P>Father's table; yea, such delicates would he send unto them,

<P>and therewith would so cover their table, that whoever saw it

<P>confessed that the like could not be seen in any kingdom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Third.&nbsp; If Mansoul did not frequently visit him as he desired

<P>they should, he would walk out to them, knock at their doors,

<P>and desire entrance, that amity might be maintained betwixt

<P>them and him; if they did hear and open to him, as commonly

<P>they would, if they were at home, then would he renew his

<P>former love, and confirm it too with some new tokens, and

<P>signs of continued favour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And was it not now amazing to behold, that in that very place

<P>where sometimes Diabolus had his abode, and entertained his

<P>Diabolonians to the almost utter destruction of Mansoul, the

<P>Prince of princes should sit eating and drinking with them,

<P>while all his mighty captains, men of war, trumpeters, with

<P>the singing-men and singing-women of his Father, stood round

<P>about to wait upon them!&nbsp; Now did Mansoul's cup run over, now

<P>did her conduits run sweet wine, now did she eat the finest

<P>of the wheat, and drink milk and honey out of the rock!&nbsp; Now,

<P>she said, How great is his goodness! for since I found favour

<P>in his eyes, how honourable have I been!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blessed Prince did also ordain a new officer in the town,

<P>and a goodly person he was; his name was Mr. God's-Peace:

<P>this man was set over my Lord Willbewill, my Lord Mayor, Mr.

<P>Recorder, the subordinate preacher, Mr. Mind, and over all

<P>the natives of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Himself was not a native

<P>of it, but came with the Prince Emmanuel from the court.&nbsp; He

<P>was a great acquaintance of Captain Credence and Captain

<P>Good-Hope; some say they were kin, and I am of that opinion

<P>too.&nbsp; This man, as I said, was made governor of the town in

<P>general, especially over the castle, and Captain Credence was

<P>to help him there.&nbsp; And I made great observation of it, that

<P>so long as all things went in Mansoul as this sweet-natured

<P>gentleman would, the town was in most happy condition.&nbsp; Now

<P>there were no jars, no chiding, no interferings, no

<P>unfaithful doings in all the town of Mansoul; every man in

<P>Mansoul kept close to his own employment.&nbsp; The gentry, the

<P>officers, the soldiers, and all in place observed their

<P>order.&nbsp; And as for the women and children of the town, they

<P>followed their business joyfully; they would work and sing,

<P>work and sing, from morning till night: so that quite through

<P>the town of Mansoul now nothing was to be found but harmony,

<P>quietness, joy, and health.&nbsp; And this lasted all that summer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But there was a man in the town of Mansoul, and his name was

<P>Mr. Carnal-Security; this man did, after all this mercy

<P>bestowed on this corporation, bring the town of Mansoul into

<P>great and grievous slavery and bondage.&nbsp; A brief account of

<P>him and of his doings take as followeth:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus at first took possession of the town of

<P>Mansoul, he brought thither, with himself, a great number of

<P>Diabolonians, men of his own conditions.&nbsp; Now among these

<P>there was one whose name was Mr. Self-Conceit, and a notable

<P>brisk man he was, as any that in those days did possess the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Diabolus, then, perceiving this man to be

<P>active and bold, sent him upon many desperate designs, the

<P>which he managed better, and more to the pleasing of his

<P>lord, than most that came with him from the dens could do.

<P>Wherefore, finding him so fit for his purpose, he preferred

<P>him, and made him next to the great Lord Willbewill, of whom

<P>we have written so much before.&nbsp; Now the Lord Willbewill

<P>being in those days very well pleased with him, and with his

<P>achievements, gave him his daughter, the Lady Fear-Nothing,

<P>to wife.&nbsp; Now, of my Lady Fear-nothing, did this Mr. Self-

<P>Conceit beget this gentleman, Mr. Carnal-Security.

<P>Wherefore, there being then in Mansoul those strange kinds of

<P>mixtures, it was hard for them, in some cases, to find out

<P>who were natives, who not, for Mr. Carnal-Security sprang

<P>from my Lord Willbewill by mother's side, though he had for

<P>his father a Diabolonian by nature.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, this Carnal-Security took much after his father and

<P>mother; he was self-conceited, he feared nothing, he was also

<P>a very busy man: nothing of news, nothing of doctrine,

<P>nothing of alteration, or talk of alteration, could at any

<P>time be on foot in Mansoul, but be sure Mr. Carnal-Security

<P>would be at the head or tail of it: but, to be sure, he would

<P>decline those that he deemed the weakest, and stood always

<P>with them in his way of standing, that he supposed was the

<P>strongest side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when Shaddai the mighty, and Emmanuel his Son, made war

<P>upon Mansoul, to take it, this Mr. Carnal-Security was then

<P>in town, and was a great doer among the people, encouraging

<P>them in their rebellion, putting them upon hardening

<P>themselves in their resisting the King's forces: but when he

<P>saw that the town of Mansoul was taken, and converted to the

<P>use of the glorious Prince Emmanuel; and when he also saw

<P>what was become of Diabolus, and how he was unroosted, and

<P>made to quit the castle in the greatest contempt and scorn;

<P>and that the town of Mansoul was well lined with captains,

<P>engines of war, and men, and also provision; what doth he but

<P>slyly wheel about also; and as he had served Diabolus against

<P>the good Prince, so he feigned that he would serve the Prince

<P>against his foes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And having got some little smattering of Emmanuel's things by

<P>the end, being bold, he ventures himself into the company of

<P>the townsmen, any attempts also to chat among them.&nbsp; Now he

<P>knew that the power and strength of the town of Mansoul was

<P>great, and that it could not but be pleasing to the people,

<P>if he cried up their might and their glory.&nbsp; Wherefore he

<P>beginneth his tale with the power and strength of Mansoul,

<P>and affirmed that it was impregnable; now magnifying their

<P>captains and their slings, and their rams; then crying up

<P>their fortifications and strongholds; and, lastly, the

<P>assurances that they had from their Prince, that Mansoul

<P>should be happy for ever.&nbsp; But when he saw that some of the

<P>men of the town were tickled and taken with his discourse, he

<P>makes it his business, and walking from street to street,

<P>house to house, and man to man, he at last brought Mansoul to

<P>dance after his pipe, and to grow almost as carnally secure

<P>as himself; so from talking they went to feasting, and from

<P>feasting to sporting; and so to some other matters.&nbsp; Now

<P>Emmanuel was yet in the town of Mansoul, and he wisely

<P>observed their doings.&nbsp; My Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill,

<P>and Mr. Recorder were also all taken with the words of this

<P>tattling Diabolonian gentleman, forgetting that their Prince

<P>had given them warning before to take heed that they were not

<P>beguiled with any Diabolonian sleight; he had further told

<P>them that the security of the now flourishing town of Mansoul

<P>did not so much lie in her present fortifications and force,

<P>as in her so using of what she had, as might oblige her

<P>Emmanuel to abide within her castle.&nbsp; For the right doctrine

<P>of Emmanuel was, that the town of Mansoul should take heed

<P>that they forgot not his Father's love and his; also, that

<P>they should so demean themselves as to continue to keep

<P>themselves therein.&nbsp; Now this was not the way to do it,

<P>namely, to fall in love with one of the Diabolonians, and

<P>with such an one too as Mr. Carnal-Security was, and to be

<P>led up and down by the nose by him; they should have heard

<P>their Prince, feared their Prince, loved their Prince, and

<P>have stoned this naughty pack to death, and took care to have

<P>walked in the ways of their Prince's prescribing: for then

<P>should their peace have been as a river, when their

<P>righteousness had been like the waves of the sea.
