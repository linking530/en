<BR><B>A RELATION OF THE HOLY WAR.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IN my travels, as I walked through many regions and

<P>countries, it was my chance to happen into that famous

<P>continent of Universe.&nbsp; A very large and spacious country it

<P>is: it lieth between the two poles, and just amidst the four

<P>points of the heavens.&nbsp; It is a place well watered, and

<P>richly adorned with hills and valleys, bravely situate, and

<P>for the most part, at least where I was, very fruitful, also

<P>well peopled, and a very sweet air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The people are not all of one complexion, nor yet of one

<P>language, mode, or way of religion, but differ as much as, it

<P>is said, do the planets themselves.&nbsp; Some are right, and some

<P>are wrong, even as it happeneth to be in lesser regions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this country, as I said, it was my lot to travel; and

<P>there travel I did, and that so long, even till I learned

<P>much of their mother tongue, together with the customs and

<P>manners of them among whom I was.&nbsp; And, to speak truth, I was

<P>much delighted to see and hear many things which I saw and

<P>heard among them; yea, I had, to be sure, even lived and died

<P>a native among them, (so was I taken with them and their

<P>doings,) had not my master sent for me home to his house,

<P>there to do business for him, and to oversee business done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now there is in this gallant country of Universe a fair and

<P>delicate town, a corporation called Mansoul; a town for its

<P>building so curious, for its situation so commodious, for its

<P>privileges so advantageous, (I mean with reference to its

<P>origin,) that I may say of it, as was said before of the

<P>continent in which it is placed, There is not its equal under

<P>the whole heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to the situation of this town, it lieth just between the

<P>two worlds; and the first founder and builder of it, so far

<P>as by the best and most authentic records I can gather, was

<P>one Shaddai; and he built it for his own delight.&nbsp; He made it

<P>the mirror and glory of all that he made, even the top-piece,

<P>beyond anything else that he did in that country.&nbsp; Yea, so

<P>goodly a town was Mansoul when first built, that it is said

<P>by some, the gods, at the setting up thereof, came down to

<P>see it, and sang for joy.&nbsp; And as he made it goodly to

<P>behold, so also mighty to have dominion over all the country

<P>round about.&nbsp; Yea, all were commanded to acknowledge Mansoul

<P>for their metropolitan, all were enjoined to do homage to it.

<P>Aye, the town itself had positive commission and power from

<P>her King to demand service of all, and also to subdue any

<P>that anyways denied to do it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous

<P>and stately palace; for strength, it might be called a

<P>castle; for pleasantness, a paradise; for largeness, a place

<P>so copious as to contain all the world.&nbsp; This place the King

<P>Shaddai intended but for himself alone, and not another with

<P>him; partly because of his own delights, and partly because

<P>he would not that the terror of strangers should be upon the

<P>town.&nbsp; This place Shaddai made also a garrison of, but

<P>committed the keeping of it only to the men of the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The walls of the town were well built, yea, so fast and firm

<P>were they knit and compact together, that, had it not been

<P>for the townsmen themselves, they could not have been shaken

<P>or broken for ever.&nbsp; For here lay the excellent wisdom of him

<P>that builded Mansoul, that the walls could never be broken

<P>down nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate, unless

<P>the townsmen gave consent thereto.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to

<P>come, out at which to go; and these were made likewise

<P>answerable to the walls, to wit, impregnable, and such as

<P>could never be opened nor forced but by the will and leave of

<P>those within.&nbsp; The names of the gates were these: Ear-gate,

<P>Eye-gate, Mouth-gate, Nose-gate, and Feel-gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Other things there were that belonged to the town of Mansoul,

<P>which if you adjoin to these, will yet give farther

<P>demonstration to all, of the glory and strength of the place.

<P>It had always a sufficiency of provision within its walls; it

<P>had the best, most wholesome, and excellent law that then was

<P>extant in the world.&nbsp; There was not a rascal, rogue, or

<P>traitorous person then within its walls; they were all true

<P>men, and fast joined together; and this, you know, is a great

<P>matter.&nbsp; And to all these, it had always (so long as it had

<P>the goodness to keep true to Shaddai the King) his

<P>countenance, his protection, and it was his delight, etc.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, upon a time, there was one Diabolus, a mighty giant,

<P>made an assault upon this famous town of Mansoul, to take it,

<P>and make it his own habitation.&nbsp; This giant was king of the

<P>blacks, and a most raving prince he was.&nbsp; We will, if you

<P>please, first discourse of the origin of this Diabolus, and

<P>then of his taking of this famous town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This Diabolus is indeed a great and mighty prince, and yet

<P>both poor and beggarly.&nbsp; As to his origin, he was at first

<P>one of the servants of King Shaddai, made, and taken, and put

<P>by him into most high and mighty place; yea, was put into

<P>such principalities as belonged to the best of his

<P>territories and dominions.&nbsp; This Diabolus was made 'son of

<P>the morning,' and a brave place he had of it: it brought him

<P>much glory, and gave him much brightness, an income that

<P>might have contented his Luciferian heart, had it not been

<P>insatiable, and enlarged as hell itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, he seeing himself thus exalted to greatness and honour,

<P>and raging in his mind for higher state and degree, what doth

<P>he but begins to think with himself how he might be set up as

<P>lord over all, and have the sole power under Shaddai.&nbsp; (Now

<P>that did the King reserve for his Son, yea, and had already

<P>bestowed it upon him.)&nbsp; Wherefore he first consults with

<P>himself what had best to be done; and then breaks his mind to

<P>some other of his companions, to the which they also agreed.

<P>So, in fine, they came to this issue that they should make an

<P>attempt upon the King's Son to destroy him, that the

<P>inheritance might be theirs.&nbsp; Well, to be short, the treason,

<P>as I said, was concluded, the time appointed, the word given,

<P>the rebels rendezvoused, and the assault attempted.&nbsp; Now the

<P>King and his Son being all and always eye, could not but

<P>discern all passages in his dominions; and he, having always

<P>love for his Son as for himself, could not at what he saw but

<P>be greatly provoked and offended: wherefore what does he, but

<P>takes them in the very nick and first trip that they made

<P>towards their design, convicts them of the treason, horrid

<P>rebellion, and conspiracy that they had devised, and now

<P>attempted to put into practice, and casts them altogether out

<P>of all place of trust, benefit, honour, and preferment.&nbsp; This

<P>done, he banishes them the court, turns them down into the

<P>horrible pits, as fast bound in chains, never more to expect

<P>the least favour from his hands, but to abide the judgment

<P>that he had appointed, and that for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now they being thus cast out of all place of trust, profit,

<P>and honour, and also knowing that they had lost their

<P>prince's favour for ever, (being banished his court, and cast

<P>down to the horrible pits,) you may he sure they would now

<P>add to their former pride what malice and rage against

<P>Shaddai, and against his Son, they could.&nbsp; Wherefore, roving

<P>and ranging in much fury from place to place, if, perhaps,

<P>they might find something that was the King's, by spoiling of

<P>that, to revenge themselves on him; at last they happened

<P>into this spacious country of Universe, and steer their

<P>course towards the town of Mansoul; and considering that that

<P>town was one of the chief works and delights of King Shaddai,

<P>what do they but, after counsel taken, make an assault upon

<P>that.&nbsp; I say, they knew that Mansoul belonged unto Shaddai;

<P>for they were there when he built it and beautified it for

<P>himself.&nbsp; So when they had found the place, they shouted

<P>horribly for joy, and roared on it as a lion upon the prey,

<P>saying, 'Now we have found the prize, and how to be revenged

<P>on King Shaddai for what he hath done to us.'&nbsp; So they sat

<P>down and called a council of war, and considered with

<P>themselves what ways and methods they had best to engage in

<P>for the winning to themselves this famous town of Mansoul,

<P>and these four things were then propounded to be considered

<P>of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First.&nbsp; Whether they had best all of them to show themselves

<P>in this design to the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Secondly.&nbsp; Whether they had best to go and sit down against

<P>Mansoul in their now ragged and beggarly guise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thirdly.&nbsp; Whether they had best show to Mansoul their

<P>intentions, and what design they came about, or whether to

<P>assault it with words and ways of deceit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fourthly.&nbsp; Whether they had not best to some of their

<P>companions to give out private orders to take the advantage,

<P>if they see one or more of the principal townsmen, to shoot

<P>them, if thereby they shall judge their cause and design will

<P>the better be promoted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. It was answered to the first of these proposals in the

<P>negative, to wit, that it would not be best that all should

<P>show themselves before the town, because the appearance of

<P>many of them might alarm and frighten the town; whereas a few

<P>or but one of them was not so likely to do it.&nbsp; And to

<P>enforce this advice to take place it was added further, that

<P>if Mansoul was frighted, or did take the alarm, 'It is

<P>impossible,' said Diabolus (for he spake now), 'that we

<P>should take the town: for that none can enter into it without

<P>its own consent.&nbsp; Let, therefore, but few, or but one,

<P>assault Mansoul; and in mine opinion,' said Diabolus, 'let me

<P>be he.'&nbsp; Wherefore to this they all agreed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. And then to the second proposal they came, namely, Whether

<P>they had best go and sit down before Mansoul in their now

<P>ragged and beggarly guise.&nbsp; To which it was answered also in

<P>the negative, By no means; and that because, though the town

<P>of Mansoul had been made to know, and to have to do, before

<P>now, with things that are invisible, they did never as yet

<P>see any of their fellow-creatures in so sad and rascally

<P>condition as they; and this was the advice of that fierce

<P>Alecto.&nbsp; Then said Apollyon, 'The advice is pertinent; for

<P>even one of us appearing to them as we are now, must needs

<P>both beget and multiply such thoughts in them as will both

<P>put them into a consternation of spirit, and necessitate them

<P>to put themselves upon their guard.&nbsp; And if so,' said he,

<P>'then, as my Lord Diabolus said but now, it is in vain for us

<P>to think of taking the town.'&nbsp; Then said that mighty giant

<P>Beelzebub, 'The advice that already is given is safe; for

<P>though the men of Mansoul have seen such things as we once

<P>were, yet hitherto they did never behold such things as we

<P>now are; and it is best, in mine opinion, to come upon them

<P>in such a guise as is common to, and most familiar among

<P>them.'&nbsp; To this, when they had consented, the next thing to

<P>be considered was, in what shape, hue, or guise Diabolus had

<P>best to show himself when he went about to make Mansoul his

<P>own.&nbsp; Then one said one thing, and another the contrary.&nbsp;
At

<P>last Lucifer answered, that, in his opinion, it was best that

<P>his lordship should assume the body of some of those

<P>creatures that they of the town had dominion over; 'for,'

<P>quoth he, 'these are not only familiar to them, but, being

<P>under them, they will never imagine that an attempt should by

<P>them be made upon the town; and, to blind all, let him assume

<P>the body of one of those beasts that Mansoul deems to be

<P>wiser than any of the rest.'&nbsp; This advice was applauded of

<P>all: so it was determined that the giant Diabolus should

<P>assume the dragon, for that he was in those days as familiar

<P>with the town of Mansoul as now is the bird with the boy; for

<P>nothing that was in its primitive state was at all amazing to

<P>them.&nbsp; Then they proceeded to the third thing, which was:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. Whether they had best to show their intentions, or the

<P>design of his coming, to Mansoul, or no.&nbsp; This also was

<P>answered in the negative, because of the weight that was in

<P>the former reasons, to wit, for that Mansoul were a strong

<P>people, a strong people in a strong town, whose wall and

<P>gates were impregnable, (to say nothing of their castle,) nor

<P>can they by any means be won but by their own consent.

<P>'Besides,' said Legion, (for he gave answer to this,) 'a

<P>discovery of our intentions may make them send to their king

<P>for aid; and if that be done, I know quickly what time of day

<P>it will be with us.&nbsp; Therefore let us assault them in all

<P>pretended fairness, covering our intentions with all manner

<P>of lies, flatteries, delusive words; feigning things that

<P>never will be, and promising that to them that they shall

<P>never find.&nbsp; This is the way to win Mansoul, and to make them

<P>of themselves open their gates to us; yea, and to desire us

<P>too to come in to them.&nbsp; And the reason why I think that this

<P>project will do is, because the people of Mansoul now are,

<P>every one, simple and innocent, all honest and true; nor do

<P>they as yet know what it is to be assaulted with fraud,

<P>guile, and hypocrisy.&nbsp; They are strangers to lying and

<P>dissembling lips; wherefore we cannot, if thus we be

<P>disguised, by them at all be discerned; our lies shall go for

<P>true sayings, and our dissimulations for upright dealings.

<P>What we promise them they will in that believe us, especially

<P>if, in all our lies and feigned words, we pretend great love

<P>to them, and that our design is only their advantage and

<P>honour.'&nbsp; Now there was not one bit of a reply against this;

<P>this went as current down as doth the water down a steep

<P>descent.&nbsp; Wherefore they go to consider of the last proposal,

<P>which was:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. Whether they had not best to give out orders to some of

<P>their company to shoot some one or more of the principal of

<P>the townsmen, if they judge that their cause may be promoted

<P>thereby.&nbsp; This was carried in the affirmative, and the man

<P>that was designed by this stratagem to be destroyed was one

<P>Mr. Resistance, otherwise called Captain Resistance.&nbsp; And a

<P>great man in Mansoul this Captain Resistance was, and a man

<P>that the giant Diabolus and his band more feared than they

<P>feared the whole town of Mansoul besides.&nbsp; Now who should be

<P>the actor to do the murder?&nbsp; That was the next, and they

<P>appointed one Tisiphone, a fury of the lake, to do it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They thus having ended their council of war, rose up, and

<P>essayed to do as they had determined; they marched towards

<P>Mansoul, but all in a manner invisible, save one, only one;

<P>nor did he approach the town in his own likeness, but under

<P>the shade and in the body of the dragon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they drew up and sat down before Ear-gate, for that was

<P>the place of hearing for all without the town, as Eye-gate

<P>was the place of perspection.&nbsp; So, as I said, he came up with

<P>his train to the gate, and laid his ambuscado for Captain

<P>Resistance within bow-shot of the town.&nbsp; This done, the giant

<P>ascended up close to the gate, and called to the town of

<P>Mansoul for audience.&nbsp; Nor took he any with him but one Ill-

<P>pause, who was his orator in all difficult matters.&nbsp; Now, as

<P>I said, he being come up to the gate, (as the manner of those

<P>times was,) sounded his trumpet for audience; at which the

<P>chief of the town of Mansoul, such as my Lord Innocent, my

<P>Lord Willbewill, my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and Captain

<P>Resistance, came down to the wall to see who was there, and

<P>what was the matter.&nbsp; And my Lord Willbewill, when he had

<P>looked over and saw who stood at the gate, demanded what he

<P>was, wherefore he was come, and why he roused the town of

<P>Mansoul with so unusual a sound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus, then, as if he had been a lamb, began his oration,

<P>and said: 'Gentlemen of the famous town of Mansoul, I am, as

<P>you may perceive, no far dweller from you, but near, and one

<P>that is bound by the king to do you my homage and what

<P>service I can; wherefore, that I may be faithful to myself

<P>and to you, I have somewhat of concern to impart unto you.

<P>Wherefore, grant me your audience, and hear me patiently.

<P>And first, I will assure you, it is not myself, but you - not

<P>mine, but your advantage that I seek by what I now do, as

<P>will full well be made manifest, by that I have opened my

<P>mind unto you.&nbsp; For, gentlemen, I am (to tell you the truth)

<P>come to show you how you may obtain great and ample

<P>deliverance from a bondage that, unawares to yourselves, you

<P>are captivated and enslaved under.'&nbsp; At this the town of

<P>Mansoul began to prick up its ears.&nbsp; And 'What is it?&nbsp; Pray

<P>what is it?' thought they.&nbsp; And he said, 'I have somewhat to

<P>say to you concerning your King, concerning his law, and also

<P>touching yourselves.&nbsp; Touching your King, I know he is great

<P>and potent; but yet all that he hath said to you is neither

<P>true nor yet for your advantage.&nbsp; 1. It is not true, for that

<P>wherewith he hath hitherto awed you, shall not come to pass,

<P>nor be fulfilled, though you do the thing that he hath

<P>forbidden.&nbsp; But if there was danger, what a slavery is it to

<P>live always in fear of the greatest of punishments, for doing

<P>so small and trivial a thing as eating of a little fruit is.

<P>2. Touching his laws, this I say further, they are both

<P>unreasonable, intricate, and intolerable.&nbsp; Unreasonable, as

<P>was hinted before; for that the punishment is not

<P>proportioned to the offence: there is great difference and

<P>disproportion between the life and an apple; yet the one must

<P>go for the other by the law of your Shaddai.&nbsp; But it is also

<P>intricate, in that he saith, first, you may eat of all; and

<P>yet after forbids the eating of one.&nbsp; And then, in the last

<P>place, it must needs be intolerable, forasmuch as that fruit

<P>which you are forbidden to eat of (if you are forbidden any)

<P>is that, and that alone, which is able, by your eating, to

<P>minister to you a good as yet unknown by you.&nbsp; This is

<P>manifest by the very name of the tree; it is called the "tree

<P>of knowledge of good and evil;" and have you that knowledge

<P>as yet? No, no; nor can you conceive how good, how pleasant,

<P>and how much to be desired to make one wise it is, so long as

<P>you stand by your King's commandment.&nbsp; Why should you be

<P>holden in ignorance and blindness?&nbsp; Why should you not be

<P>enlarged in knowledge and understanding?&nbsp; And now, O ye

<P>inhabitants of the famous town of Mansoul, to speak more

<P>particularly to yourselves you are not a free people!&nbsp; You

<P>are kept both in bondage and slavery, and that by a grievous

<P>threat; no reason being annexed but, "So I will have it; so

<P>it shall be."&nbsp; And is it not grievous to think on, that that

<P>very thing which you are forbidden to do might you but do it,

<P>would yield you both wisdom and honour? for then your eyes

<P>will be opened, and you shall be as gods.&nbsp; Now, since this is

<P>thus,' quoth he, 'can you be kept by any prince in more

<P>slavery and in greater bondage than you are under this day?

<P>You are made underlings, and are wrapped up in

<P>inconveniences, as I have well made appear.&nbsp; For what bondage

<P>greater than to be kept in blindness?&nbsp; Will not reason tell

<P>you that it is better to have eyes than to be without them?

<P>and so to be at liberty to be better than to be shut up in a

<P>dark and stinking cave?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And just now, while Diabolus was speaking these words to

<P>Mansoul, Tisiphone shot at Captain Resistance, where he stood

<P>on the gate, and mortally wounded him in the head; so that

<P>he, to the amazement of the townsmen, and the encouragement

<P>of Diabolus, fell down dead quite over the wall.&nbsp; Now, when

<P>Captain Resistance was dead, (and he was the only man of war

<P>in the town,) poor Mansoul was wholly left naked of courage,

<P>nor had she now any heart to resist.&nbsp; But this was as the

<P>devil would have it.&nbsp; Then stood forth he, Mr. Ill-pause,

<P>that Diabolus brought with him, who was his orator; and he

<P>addressed himself to speak to the town of Mansoul; the tenour

<P>of whose speech here follows:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'it is my master's happiness that he

<P>has this day a quiet and teachable auditory; and it is hoped

<P>by us that we shall prevail with you not to cast off good

<P>advice.&nbsp; My master has a very great love for you; and

<P>although, as he very well knows, that he runs the hazard of

<P>the anger of King Shaddai, yet love to you will make him do

<P>more than that.&nbsp; Nor doth there need that a word more should

<P>be spoken to confirm for truth what he hath said; there is

<P>not a word but carries with it self-evidence in its bowels;

<P>the very name of the tree may put an end to all controversy

<P>in this matter.&nbsp; I therefore, at this time, shall only add

<P>this advice to you, under and by the leave of my lord;' (and

<P>with that he made Diabolus a very low congee;) 'consider his

<P>words, look on the tree and the promising fruit thereof;

<P>remember also that yet you know but little, and that this is

<P>the way to know more: and if your reasons be not conquered to

<P>accept of such good counsel, you are not the men that I took

<P>you to be.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when the townsfolk saw that the tree was good for food,

<P>and that it was pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired

<P>to make one wise, they did as old Ill-pause advised; they

<P>took and did eat thereof.&nbsp; Now this I should have told you

<P>before, that even then, when this Ill-pause was making his

<P>speech to the townsmen, my Lord Innocency (whether by a shot

<P>from the camp of the giant, or from some sinking qualm that

<P>suddenly took him, or whether by the stinking breath of that

<P>treacherous villain old Ill-pause, for so I am most apt to

<P>think) sunk down in the place where he stood, nor could be

<P>brought to life again.&nbsp; Thus these two brave men died - brave

<P>men, I call them; for they were the beauty and glory of

<P>Mansoul, so long as they lived therein; nor did there now

<P>remain any more a noble spirit in Mansoul; they all fell down

<P>and yielded obedience to Diabolus; and became his slaves and

<P>vassals, as you shall hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now these being dead, what do the rest of the townsfolk, but,

<P>as men that had found a fool's paradise, they presently, as

<P>afore was hinted, fall to prove the truth of the giant's

<P>words.&nbsp; And, first, they did as Ill-pause had taught them;

<P>they looked, they considered they were taken with the

<P>forbidden fruit; they took thereof, and did eat; and having

<P>eaten, they became immediately drunken therewith.&nbsp; So they

<P>open the gate, both Ear-gate and Eye-gate, and let in

<P>Diabolus with all his bands, quite forgetting their good

<P>Shaddai, his law, and the judgment that he had annexed, with

<P>solemn threatening, to the breach thereof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;Diabolus, having now obtained entrance in at the gates of

<P>the town, marches up to the middle thereof, to make his

<P>conquest as sure as he could; and finding, by this time, the

<P>affections of the people warmly inclining to him, he, as

<P>thinking it was best striking while the iron is hot, made

<P>this further deceivable speech unto them, saying, 'Alas, my

<P>poor Mansoul!&nbsp; I have done thee indeed this service, as to

<P>promote thee to honour, and to greaten thy liberty; but,

<P>alas! alas! poor Mansoul, thou wantest now one to defend

<P>thee; for assure thyself that when Shaddai shall hear what is

<P>done, he will come; for sorry will he be that thou hast

<P>broken his bonds, and cast his cords away from thee.&nbsp; What

<P>wilt thou do?&nbsp; Wilt thou, after enlargement, suffer thy

<P>privileges to be invaded and taken away, or what wilt resolve

<P>with thyself?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they all with one consent said to this bramble, 'Do thou

<P>reign over us.'&nbsp; So he accepted the motion, and became the

<P>king of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; This being done, the next thing

<P>was to give him possession of the castle, and so of the whole

<P>strength of the town.&nbsp; Wherefore, into the castle he goes; it

<P>was that which Shaddai built in Mansoul for his own delight

<P>and pleasure; this now was become a den and hold for the

<P>giant Diabolus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, having got possession of this stately palace or castle,

<P>what doth he but makes it a garrison for himself, and

<P>strengthens and fortifies it with all sorts of provision,

<P>against the King Shaddai, or those that should endeavour the

<P>regaining of it to him and his obedience again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This done, but not thinking himself yet secure enough, in the

<P>next place he bethinks himself of new modelling the town; and

<P>so he does, setting up one, and putting down another at

<P>pleasure.&nbsp; Wherefore my Lord Mayor, whose name was my Lord

<P>Understanding, and Mr. Recorder, whose name was Mr.

<P>Conscience, these he put out of place and power.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for my Lord Mayor, though he was an understanding man, and

<P>one too that had complied with the rest of the town of

<P>Mansoul in admitting the giant into the town, yet Diabolus

<P>thought not fit to let him abide in his former lustre and

<P>glory, because he was a seeing man.&nbsp; Wherefore he darkened

<P>him, not only by taking from him his office and power, but by

<P>building a high and strong tower, just between the sun's

<P>reflections and the windows of my lord's palace; by which

<P>means his house and all, and the whole of his habitation,

<P>were made as dark as darkness itself.&nbsp; And thus, being

<P>alienated from the light, he became as one that was born

<P>blind.&nbsp; To this, his house, my lord was confined as to a

<P>prison; nor might he, upon his parole, go farther than within

<P>his own bounds.&nbsp; And now, had he had a heart to do for

<P>Mansoul, what could he do for it, or wherein could he be

<P>profitable to her?&nbsp; So then, so long as Mansoul was under the

<P>power and government of Diabolus, (and so long it was under

<P>him, as it was obedient to him, which was even until by a war

<P>it was rescued out of his hand,) so long my Lord Mayor was

<P>rather an impediment in, than an advantage to the famous town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for Mr. Recorder, before the town was taken, he was a man

<P>well read in the laws of his king, and also a man of courage

<P>and faithfulness to speak truth at every occasion; and he had

<P>a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled with

<P>judgment.&nbsp; Now, this man Diabolus could by no means abide,

<P>because, though he gave his consent to his coming into the

<P>town, yet he could not, by all the wiles, trials, stratagems,

<P>and devices that he could use, make him wholly his own.

<P>True, he was much degenerated from his former king, and also

<P>much pleased with many of the giant's laws and service; but

<P>all this would not do, forasmuch as he was not wholly his.

<P>He would now and then think upon Shaddai, and have dread of

<P>his law upon him, and then he would speak against Diabolus

<P>with a voice as great as when a lion roareth.&nbsp; Yea, and would

<P>also at certain times, when his fits were upon him, (for you

<P>must know that sometimes he had terrible fits,) make the

<P>whole town of Mansoul shake with his voice: and therefore the

<P>now king of Mansoul could not abide him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus, therefore, feared the Recorder more than any that

<P>was left alive in the town of Mansoul, because, as I said,

<P>his words did shake the whole town; they were like the

<P>rattling thunder, and also like thunder-claps.&nbsp; Since,

<P>therefore, the giant could not make him wholly his own, what

<P>doth he do but studies all that he could to debauch the old

<P>gentleman, and by debauchery to stupefy his mind, and more

<P>harden his heart in the ways of vanity.&nbsp; And as he attempted,

<P>so he accomplished his design: he debauched the man, and by

<P>little and little so drew him into sin and wickedness, that

<P>at last he was not only debauched, as at first, and so by

<P>consequence defiled, but was almost (at last, I say) past all

<P>conscience of sin.&nbsp; And this was the farthest Diabolus could

<P>go.&nbsp; Wherefore he bethinks him of another project, and that

<P>was, to persuade the men of the town that Mr. Recorder was

<P>mad, and so not to be regarded.&nbsp; And for this he urged his

<P>fits, and said, 'If he be himself, why doth he not do thus

<P>always?&nbsp; But,' quoth he, 'as all mad folks have their fits,

<P>and in them their raving language, so hath this old and

<P>doating gentleman.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus, by one means or another, he quickly got Mansoul to

<P>slight, neglect, and despise whatever Mr. Recorder could say.

<P>For, besides what already you have heard, Diabolus had a way

<P>to make the old gentleman, when he was merry, unsay and deny

<P>what he in his fits had affirmed.&nbsp; And, indeed, this was the

<P>next way to make himself ridiculous, and to cause that no man

<P>should regard him.&nbsp; Also now he never spake freely for King

<P>Shaddai, but also by force and constraint.&nbsp; Besides, he would

<P>at one time be hot against that at which, at another, he

<P>would hold his peace; so uneven was he now in his doings.

<P>Sometimes he would be as if fast asleep, and again sometimes

<P>as dead, even then when the whole town of Mansoul was in her

<P>career after vanity, and in her dance after the giant's pipe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore, sometimes when Mansoul did use to be frighted with

<P>the thundering voice of the Recorder that was, and when they

<P>did tell Diabolus of it, he would answer, that what the old

<P>gentleman said was neither of love to him nor pity to them,

<P>but of a foolish fondness that he had to be prating; and so

<P>would hush, still, and put all to quiet again.&nbsp; And that he

<P>might leave no argument unurged that might tend to make them

<P>secure, he said, and said it often, 'O Mansoul! consider

<P>that, notwithstanding the old gentleman's rage, and the

<P>rattle of his high and thundering words, you hear nothing of

<P>Shaddai himself;' when, liar and deceiver that he was, every

<P>outcry of Mr. Recorder against the sin of Mansoul was the

<P>voice of God in him to them.&nbsp; But he goes on, and says, 'You

<P>see that he values not the loss nor rebellion of the town of

<P>Mansoul, nor will he trouble himself with calling his town to

<P>a reckoning for their giving themselves to me.&nbsp; He knows that

<P>though you were his, now you are lawfully mine; so, leaving

<P>us one to another, he now hath shaken his hands of us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Moreover, O Mansoul!' quoth he, 'consider how I have served

<P>you, even to the uttermost of my power; and that with the

<P>best that I have, could get, or procure for you in all the

<P>world: besides, I dare say that the laws and customs that you

<P>now are under, and by which you do homage to me, do yield you

<P>more solace and content than did the paradise that at first

<P>you possessed.&nbsp; Your liberty also, as yourselves do very well

<P>know, has been greatly widened and enlarged by me; whereas I

<P>found you a penned-up people.&nbsp; I have not laid any restraint

<P>upon you; you have no law, statute, or judgment of mine to

<P>fright you; I call none of you to account for your doings,

<P>except the madman - you know who I mean; I have granted you

<P>to live, each man like a prince in his own, even with as

<P>little control from me as I myself have from you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And thus would Diabolus hush up and quiet the town of

<P>Mansoul, when the Recorder that was, did at times molest

<P>them: yea, and with such cursed orations as these, would set

<P>the whole town in a rage and fury against the old gentleman.

<P>Yea, the rascal crew at some times would be for destroying

<P>him.&nbsp; They have often wished, in my hearing, that he had

<P>lived a thousand miles off from them: his company, his words,

<P>yea, the sight of him, and specially when they remembered how

<P>in old times he did use to threaten and condemn them, (for

<P>all he was now so debauched,) did terrify and afflict them

<P>sore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But all wishes were vain, for I do not know how, unless by

<P>the power of Shaddai, and his wisdom, he was preserved in

<P>being amongst them.&nbsp; Besides, his house was as strong as a

<P>castle, and stood hard by a stronghold of the town: moreover,

<P>if at any time any of the crew or rabble attempted to make

<P>him away, he could pull up the sluices, and let in such

<P>floods as would drown all round about him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But to leave Mr. Recorder, and to come to my Lord Willbewill,

<P>another of the gentry of the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; This

<P>Willbewill was as high-born as any man in Mansoul, and was as

<P>much, if not more, a freeholder than many of them were;

<P>besides, if I remember my tale aright, he had some privileges

<P>peculiar to himself in the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now,

<P>together with these, he was a man of great strength,

<P>resolution, and courage, nor in his occasion could any turn

<P>him away.&nbsp; But I say, whether he was proud of his estate,

<P>privileges, strength, or what, (but sure it was through pride

<P>of something,) he scorns now to be a slave in Mansoul; and

<P>therefore resolves to bear office under Diabolus, that he

<P>might (such an one as he was) be a petty ruler and governor

<P>in Mansoul.&nbsp; And, headstrong man that he was! thus he began

<P>betimes; for this man, when Diabolus did make his oration at

<P>Ear-gate, was one of the first that was for consenting to his

<P>words, and for accepting his counsel at wholesome, and that

<P>was for the opening of the gate, and for letting him into the

<P>town; wherefore Diabolus had a kindness for him, and

<P>therefore he designed for him a place.&nbsp; And perceiving the

<P>valour and stoutness of the man, he coveted to have him for

<P>one of his great ones, to act and do in matters of the

<P>highest concern.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he sent for him, and talked with him of that secret matter

<P>that lay in his breast, but there needed not much persuasion

<P>in the case.&nbsp; For as at first he was willing that Diabolus

<P>should be let into the town, so now he was as willing to

<P>serve him there.&nbsp; When the tyrant, therefore, perceived the

<P>willingness of my lord to serve him, and that his mind stood

<P>bending that way, he forthwith made him the captain of the

<P>castle, governor of the wall, and keeper of the gates of

<P>Mansoul: yea, there was a clause in his commission, that

<P>nothing without him should be done in all the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; So that now, next to Diabolus himself, who but my

<P>Lord Willbewill in all the town of Mansoul! nor could

<P>anything now be done, but at his will and pleasure,

<P>throughout the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He had also one Mr. Mind for

<P>his clerk, a man to speak on every way like his master: for

<P>he and his lord were in principle one, and in practice not

<P>far asunder.&nbsp; And now was Mansoul brought under to purpose,

<P>and made to fulfil the lusts of the will, and of the mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate one this

<P>Willbewill was when power was put into his hand.&nbsp; First, he

<P>flatly denied that he owed any suit or service to his former

<P>prince and liege lord.&nbsp; This done, in the next place he took

<P>an oath, and swore fidelity to his great master Diabolus, and

<P>then, being stated and settled in his places, offices,

<P>advancements, and preferments, oh! you cannot think, unless

<P>you had seen it, the strange work that this workman made in

<P>the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First, he maligned Mr. Recorder to death; he would neither

<P>endure to see him, nor hear the words of his mouth; he would

<P>shut his eyes when he saw him, and stop his ears when he

<P>heard him speak.&nbsp; Also he could not endure that so much as a

<P>fragment of the law of Shaddai should be anywhere seen in the

<P>town.&nbsp; For example, his clerk, Mr. Mind, had some old, rent,

<P>and torn parchments of the law of Shaddai in his house, but

<P>when Willbewill saw them, he cast them behind his back.

<P>True, Mr. Recorder had some of the laws in his study; but my

<P>lord could by no means come at them.&nbsp; He also thought and

<P>said, that the windows of my old Lord Mayor's house were

<P>always too light for the profit of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; The

<P>light of a candle he could not endure.&nbsp; Now nothing at all

<P>pleased Willbewill but what pleased Diabolus his lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was none like him to trumpet about the streets the

<P>brave nature, the wise conduct, and great glory of the king

<P>Diabolus.&nbsp; He would range and rove throughout all the streets

<P>of Mansoul to cry up his illustrious lord, and would make

<P>himself even as an abject, among the base and rascal crew, to

<P>cry up his valiant prince.&nbsp; And I say, when and wheresoever

<P>he found these vassals, he would even make himself as one of

<P>them.&nbsp; In all ill courses he would act without bidding, and

<P>do mischief without commandment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Lord Willbewill also had a deputy under him, and his name

<P>was Mr. Affection, one that was also greatly debauched in his

<P>principles, and answerable thereto in his life: he was wholly

<P>given to the flesh, and therefore they called him Vile-

<P>Affection.&nbsp; Now there was he and one Carnal-Lust, the

<P>daughter of Mr. Mind, (like to like,) that fell in love, and

<P>made a match, and were married; and, as I take it, they had

<P>several children, as Impudent, Blackmouth, and Hate-Reproof.

<P>These three were black boys.&nbsp; And besides these they had

<P>three daughters, as Scorn-Truth and Slight-God, and the name

<P>of the youngest was Revenge.&nbsp; These were all married in the

<P>town, and also begot and yielded many bad brats, too many to

<P>be here inserted.&nbsp; But to pass by this.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the giant had thus engarrisoned himself in the town of

<P>Mansoul, and had put down and set up whom he thought good, he

<P>betakes himself to defacing.&nbsp; Now there was in the market-

<P>place in Mansoul, and also upon the gates of the castle, an

<P>image of the blessed King Shaddai.&nbsp; This image was so exactly

<P>engraven, (and it was engraven in gold,) that it did the most

<P>resemble Shaddai himself of anything that then was extant in

<P>the world.&nbsp; This he basely commanded to be defaced, and it

<P>was as basely done by the hand of Mr. No-Truth.&nbsp; Now you must

<P>know that, as Diabolus had commanded, and that by the hand of

<P>Mr. No-Truth, the image of Shaddai was defaced, he likewise

<P>gave order that the same Mr. No-Truth should set up in its

<P>stead the horrid and formidable image of Diabolus, to the

<P>great contempt of the former King, and debasing of his town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Moreover, Diabolus made havoc of all remains of the laws and

<P>statutes of Shaddai that could be found in the town of

<P>Mansoul; to wit, such as contained either the doctrines of

<P>morals, with all civil and natural documents.&nbsp; Also relative

<P>severities he sought to extinguish.&nbsp; To be short, there was

<P>nothing of the remains of good in Mansoul which he and

<P>Willbewill sought not to destroy; for their design was to

<P>turn Mansoul into a brute, and to make it like to the sensual

<P>sow, by the hand of Mr. No-Truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he had destroyed what law and good orders he could, then

<P>further to effect his design, namely, to alienate Mansoul

<P>from Shaddai her King, he commands, and they set up his own

<P>vain edicts, statutes, and commandments, in all places of

<P>resort or concourse in Mansoul, to wit, such as gave liberty

<P>to the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eyes, and the

<P>pride of life, which are not of Shaddai, but of the world.

<P>He encouraged, countenanced, and promoted lasciviousness, and

<P>all ungodliness there.&nbsp; Yea, much more did Diabolus to

<P>encourage wickedness in the town of Mansoul; he promised them

<P>peace, content, joy, and bliss, in doing his commands, and

<P>that they should never be called to an account for their not

<P>doing the contrary.&nbsp; And let this serve to give a taste to

<P>them that love to hear tell of what is done beyond their

<P>knowledge afar off in other countries.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Mansoul being wholly at his beck, and brought wholly to

<P>his bow, nothing was heard or seen therein but that which

<P>tended to set up him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now he, having disabled the Lord Mayor and Mr. Recorder

<P>from bearing of office in Mansoul, and seeing that the town,

<P>before he came to it, was the most ancient of corporations in

<P>the world, and fearing, if he did not maintain greatness,

<P>they at any time should object that he had done them an

<P>injury; therefore, I say, (that they might see that he did

<P>not intend to lessen their grandeur, or to take from them any

<P>of their advantageous things,) he did choose for them a Lord

<P>Mayor and a Recorder himself, and such as contented them at

<P>the heart, and such also as pleased him wondrous well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The name of the Mayor that was of Diabolus' making was the

<P>Lord Lustings, a man that had neither eyes nor ears.&nbsp; All

<P>that he did, whether as a man or an officer, he did it

<P>naturally, as doth the beast.&nbsp; And that which made him yet

<P>the more ignoble, though not to Mansoul, yet to them that

<P>beheld and were grieved for its ruin, was, that he never

<P>could favour good, but evil.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Recorder was one whose name was Forget-Good, and a very

<P>sorry fellow he was.&nbsp; He could remember nothing but mischief,

<P>and to do it with delight.&nbsp; He was naturally prone to do

<P>things that were hurtful, even hurtful to the town of

<P>Mansoul, and to all the dwellers there.&nbsp; These two,

<P>therefore, by their power and practice, examples, and smiles

<P>upon evil, did much more grammar and settle the common people

<P>in hurtful ways.&nbsp; For who doth not perceive that when those

<P>that sit aloft are vile and corrupt themselves, they corrupt

<P>the whole region and country where they are?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Besides these, Diabolus made several burgesses and aldermen

<P>in Mansoul, such as out of whom the town, when it needed,

<P>might choose them officers, governors, and magistrates.&nbsp; And

<P>these are the names of the chief of them: Mr. Incredulity,

<P>Mr. Haughty, Mr. Swearing, Mr. Whoring, Mr. Hard-Heart, Mr.

<P>Pitiless, Mr. Fury, Mr. No-Truth, Mr. Stand-to-Lies, Mr.

<P>False-Peace, Mr. Drunkenness, Mr. Cheating, Mr. Atheism -

<P>thirteen in all.&nbsp; Mr. Incredulity is the eldest, and Mr.

<P>Atheism the youngest of the company.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was also an election of common councilmen and others,

<P>as bailiffs, sergeants, constables, and others; but all of

<P>them like to those afore-named, being either fathers,

<P>brothers, cousins, or nephews to them, whose names, for

<P>brevity's sake, I omit to mention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the giant had thus far proceeded in his work, in the

<P>next place, he betook him to build some strongholds in the

<P>town, and he built three that seemed to be impregnable.&nbsp; The

<P>first he called the Hold of Defiance, because it was made to

<P>command the whole town, and to keep it from the knowledge of

<P>its ancient King.&nbsp; The second he called Midnight Hold,

<P>because it was built on purpose to keep Mansoul from the true

<P>knowledge of itself.&nbsp; The third was called Sweet-Sin Hold,

<P>because by that he fortified Mansoul against all desires of

<P>good.&nbsp; The first of these holds stood close by Eye-gate,

<P>that, as much might be, light might be darkened there; the

<P>second was built hard by the old castle, to the end that that

<P>might be made more blind, if possible; and the third stood in

<P>the market-place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He that Diabolus made governor over the first of these was

<P>one Spite-God, a most blasphemous wretch: he came with the

<P>whole rabble of them that came against Mansoul at first, and

<P>was himself one of themselves.&nbsp; He that was made the governor

<P>of Midnight Hold was one Love-no-Light; he was also of them

<P>that came first against the town.&nbsp; And he that was made the

<P>governor of the hold called Sweet-Sin Hold was one whose name

<P>was Love-Flesh: he was also a very lewd fellow, but not of

<P>that country where the other are bound.&nbsp; This fellow could

<P>find more sweetness when he stood sucking of a lust than he

<P>did in all the paradise of God.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now Diabolus thought himself safe.&nbsp; He had taken Mansoul,

<P>he had engarrisoned himself therein; he had put down the old

<P>officers, and had set up new ones; he had defaced the image

<P>of Shaddai, and had set up his own; he had spoiled the old

<P>law books, and had promoted his own vain lies; he had made

<P>him new magistrates, and set up new aldermen; he had builded

<P>him new holds, and had manned them for himself: and all this

<P>he did to make himself secure, in case the good Shaddai, or

<P>his Son, should come to make an incursion upon him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now you may well think, that long before this time, word, by

<P>some one or other, could not but be carried to the good King

<P>Shaddai, how his Mansoul, in the continent of Universe, was

<P>lost; and that the runagate giant Diabolus, once one of his

<P>Majesty's servants, had, in rebellion against the King, made

<P>sure thereof for himself.&nbsp; Yea, tidings were carried and

<P>brought to the King thereof, and that to a very circumstance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At first, how Diabolus came upon Mansoul (they being a simple

<P>people and innocent) with craft, subtlety, lies, and guile.

<P>ITEM, that he had treacherously slain the right noble and

<P>valiant captain, their Captain Resistance, as he stood upon

<P>the gate with the rest of the townsmen.&nbsp; ITEM, how my brave

<P>Lord Innocent fell down dead (with grief, some say, or with

<P>being poisoned with the stinking breath of one Ill-Pause, as

<P>say others) at the hearing of his just lord and rightful

<P>prince, Shaddai, so abused by the mouth of so filthy a

<P>Diabolian as that varlet Ill-Pause was.&nbsp; The messenger

<P>further told, that after this Ill-Pause had made a short

<P>oration to the townsmen in behalf of Diabolus, his master;

<P>the simple town, believing that what was said was true, with

<P>one consent did open Ear-gate, the chief gate of the

<P>corporation, and did let him, with his crew, into a

<P>possession of the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He further showed

<P>how Diabolus had served the Lord Mayor and Mr. Recorder, to

<P>wit, that he had put them from all place of power and trust.

<P>ITEM, he showed also that my Lord Willbewill was turned a

<P>very rebel, and runagate, and that so was one Mr. Mind, his

<P>clerk; and that they two did range and revel it all the town

<P>over, and teach the wicked ones their ways.&nbsp; He said,

<P>moreover, that this Willbewill was put into great trust, and

<P>particularly that Diabolus had put into Willbewill's hand all

<P>the strong places in Mansoul; and that Mr. Affection was made

<P>my Lord Willbewill's deputy in his most rebellious affairs.

<P>'Yea,' said the messenger, 'this monster, Lord Willbewill,

<P>has openly disavowed his King Shaddai, and hath horribly

<P>given his faith and plighted his troth to Diabolus.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Also,' said the messenger, 'besides all this, the new king,

<P>or rather rebellious tyrant, over the once famous, but now

<P>perishing town of Mansoul, has set up a Lord Mayor and a

<P>Recorder of his own.&nbsp; For Mayor, he has set up one Mr.

<P>Lustings; and for Recorder, Mr. Forget-Good; two of the

<P>vilest of all the town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; This faithful messenger

<P>also proceeded, and told what a sort of new burgesses

<P>Diabolus had made; also that he had built several strong

<P>forts, towers, and strongholds in Mansoul.&nbsp; He told, too, the

<P>which I had almost forgot, how Diabolus had put the town of

<P>Mansoul into arms, the better to capacitate them, on his

<P>behalf, to make resistance against Shaddai their King, should

<P>he come to reduce them to their former obedience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now this tidings-teller did not deliver his relation of

<P>things in private, but in open court, the King and his Son,

<P>high lords, chief captains, and nobles, being all there

<P>present to hear.&nbsp; But by that they had heard the whole of the

<P>story, it would have amazed one to have seen, had he been

<P>there to behold it, what sorrow and grief, and compunction of

<P>spirit, there was among all sorts, to think that famous

<P>Mansoul was now taken: only the King and his Son foresaw all

<P>this long before, yea, and sufficiently provided for the

<P>relief of Mansoul, though they told not everybody thereof.

<P>Yet because they also would have a share in condoling of the

<P>Misery of Mansoul, therefore they also did, and that at a

<P>rate of the highest degree, bewail the losing of Mansoul.

<P>The King said plainly that it grieved him at the heart, and

<P>you may be sure that his Son was not a whit behind him.&nbsp; Thus

<P>gave they conviction to all about them that they had love and

<P>compassion for the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Well, when the

<P>King and his Son were retired into the privy chamber, there

<P>they again consulted about what they had designed before, to

<P>wit, that as Mansoul should in time be suffered to be lost,

<P>so as certainly it should be recovered again; recovered, I

<P>say, in such a way, as that both the King and his Son would

<P>get themselves eternal fame and glory thereby.&nbsp; Wherefore,

<P>after this consult, the Son of Shaddai (a sweet and comely

<P>Person, and one that had always great affection for those

<P>that were in affliction, but one that had mortal enmity in

<P>his heart against Diabolus, because he was designed for it,

<P>and because he sought his crown and dignity) - this Son of

<P>Shaddai, I say, having stricken hands with his Father and

<P>promised that he would be his servant to recover his Mansoul

<P>again, stood by his resolution, nor would he repent of the

<P>same.&nbsp; The purport of which agreement was this: to wit, that

<P>at a certain time, prefixed by both, the King's Son should

<P>take a journey into the country of Universe, and there, in a

<P>way of justice and equity, by making amends for the follies

<P>of Mansoul, he should lay a foundation of perfect deliverance

<P>from Diabolus and from his tyranny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Moreover Emmanuel resolved to make, at a time convenient, a

<P>war upon the giant Diabolus, even while he was possessed of

<P>the town of Mansoul; and that he would fairly by strength of

<P>hand drive him out of his hold, his nest, and take it to

<P>himself to be his habitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This now being resolved upon, order was given to the Lord

<P>Chief Secretary to draw up a fair record of what was

<P>determined, and to cause that it should be published in all

<P>the corners of the kingdom of Universe.&nbsp; A short breviate of

<P>the contents thereof you may, if you please, take here as

<P>follows:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Let all men know who are concerned, that the Son of Shaddai,

<P>the great King, is engaged by covenant to his Father to bring

<P>his Mansoul to him again; yea, and to put Mansoul, too,

<P>through the power of his matchless love, into a far better

<P>and more happy condition than it was in before it was taken

<P>by Diabolus.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These papers, therefore, were published in several places, to

<P>the no little molestation of the tyrant Diabolus; 'for now,'

<P>thought he, 'I shall be molested, and my habitation will be

<P>taken from me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when this matter, I mean this purpose of the King and his

<P>Son, did at first take air at court, who can tell how the

<P>high lords, chief captains, and noble princes that were

<P>there, were taken with the business!&nbsp; First, they whispered

<P>it one to another, and after that it began to ring out

<P>through the King's palace, all wondering at the glorious

<P>design that between the King and his Son was on foot for the

<P>miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, the courtiers could scarce

<P>do anything either for the King or kingdom, but they would

<P>mix, with the doing thereof, a noise of the love of the King

<P>and his Son, that they had for the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nor could these lords, high captains, and princes be content

<P>to keep this news at court; yea, before the records thereof

<P>were perfected, themselves came down and told it in Universe.

<P>At last it came to the ears, as I said, of Diabolus, to his

<P>no little discontent; for you must think it would perplex him

<P>to hear of such a design against him.&nbsp; Well, but after a few

<P>casts in his mind, he concluded upon these four things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First, that this news, these good tidings, (if possible,)

<P>should be kept from the ears of the town of Mansoul; 'for,'

<P>said he, 'if they should once come to the knowledge that

<P>Shaddai, their former King, and Emmanuel his Son, are

<P>contriving good for the town of Mansoul, what can be expected

<P>by me, but that Mansoul will make a revolt from under my hand

<P>and government, and return again to him?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, to accomplish this his design, he renews his flattery

<P>with my Lord Willbewill, and also gives him strict charge and

<P>command, that he should keep watch by day and by night at all

<P>the gates of the town, especially Ear-gate and Eye-gate; 'for

<P>I hear of a design,' quoth he, 'a design to make us all

<P>traitors, and that Mansoul must be reduced to its first

<P>bondage again.&nbsp; I hope they are but flying stories,' quoth

<P>he; 'however, let no such news by any means be let into

<P>Mansoul, lest the people be dejected thereat.&nbsp; I think, my

<P>lord, it can be no welcome news to you; I am sure it is none

<P>to me; and I think that, at this time, it should be all our

<P>wisdom and care to nip the head of all such rumours as shall

<P>tend to trouble our people.&nbsp; Wherefore I desire, my lord,

<P>that you will in this matter do as I say.&nbsp; Let there be

<P>strong guards daily kept at every gate of the town.&nbsp; Stop

<P>also and examine from whence such come that you perceive do

<P>from far come hither to trade, nor let them by any means be

<P>admitted into Mansoul, unless you shall plainly perceive that

<P>they are favourers of our excellent government.&nbsp; I command,

<P>moreover,' said Diabolus, 'that there be spies continually

<P>walking up and down the town of Mansoul, and let them have

<P>power to suppress and destroy any that they shall perceive to

<P>be plotting against us, or that shall prate of what by

<P>Shaddai and Emmanuel is intended.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This, therefore, was accordingly done; my Lord Willbewill

<P>hearkened to his lord and master, went willingly after the

<P>commandment, and, with all the diligence he could, kept any

<P>that would from going out abroad, or that sought to bring

<P>these tidings to Mansoul, from coming into the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Secondly, this done, in the next place, Diabolus, that he

<P>might make Mansoul as sure as he could, frames and imposes a

<P>new oath and horrible covenant upon the townsfolk:- To wit,

<P>that they should never desert him nor his government, nor yet

<P>betray him, nor seek to alter his laws; but that they should

<P>own, confess, stand by, and acknowledge him for their

<P>rightful king, in defiance to any that do or hereafter shall,

<P>by any pretence, law, or title whatever, lay claim to the

<P>town of Mansoul; thinking, belike, that Shaddai had not power

<P>to absolve them from this covenant with death, and agreement

<P>with hell.&nbsp; Nor did the silly Mansoul stick or boggle at all

<P>at this most monstrous engagement; but, as if it had been a

<P>sprat in the mouth of a whale, they swallowed it without any

<P>chewing.&nbsp; Were they troubled at all?&nbsp; Nay, they rather

<P>bragged and boasted of their so brave fidelity to the tyrant,

<P>their pretended king, swearing that they would never be

<P>changelings, nor forsake their old lord for a new.&nbsp; Thus did

<P>Diabolus tie poor Mansoul fast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thirdly.&nbsp; But jealousy, that never thinks itself strong

<P>enough, put him, in the next place, upon another exploit,

<P>which was, yet more, if possible, to debauch this town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore he caused, by the hand of one Mr. Filth,

<P>an odious, nasty, lascivious piece of beastliness to be drawn

<P>up in writing, and to be set upon the castle gates; whereby

<P>he granted and gave license to all his true and trusty sons

<P>in Mansoul to do whatsoever their lustful appetites prompted

<P>them to do; and that no man was to let, hinder, or control

<P>them, upon pain of incurring the displeasure of their prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now this he did for these reasons:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. That the town of Mansoul might be yet made weaker and

<P>weaker, and so more unable, should tidings come that their

<P>redemption was designed, to believe, hope, or consent to the

<P>truth thereof; for reason says, The bigger the sinner, the

<P>less grounds of hopes of mercy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. The second reason was, if perhaps Emmanuel, the Son of

<P>Shaddai their King, by seeing the horrible and profane doings

<P>of the town of Mansoul, might repent, though entered into a

<P>covenant of redeeming them, of pursuing that covenant of

<P>their redemption; for he knew that Shaddai was holy, and that

<P>his Son Emmanuel was holy; yea, he knew it by woeful

<P>experience, for for his iniquity and sin was Diabolus cast

<P>from the highest orbs.&nbsp; Wherefore what more rational than for

<P>him to conclude that thus, for sin, it might fare with

<P>Mansoul?&nbsp; But fearing also lest this knot should break, he

<P>bethinks himself of another, to wit:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fourthly.&nbsp; To endeavour to possess all hearts in the town of

<P>Mansoul that Shaddai was raising an army, to come to

<P>overthrow and utterly to destroy this town of Mansoul.&nbsp; And

<P>this he did to forestall any tidings that might come to their

<P>ears of their deliverance: 'For,' thought he, 'if I first

<P>bruit this, the tidings that shall come after will all be

<P>swallowed up of this; for what else will Mansoul say, when

<P>they shall hear that they must be delivered, but that the

<P>true meaning is, Shaddai intends to destroy them?&nbsp; Wherefore

<P>he summons the whole town into the market-place, and there,

<P>with deceitful tongue, thus he addressed himself unto them:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen, and my very good friends, you are all, as you

<P>know, my legal subjects, and men of the famous town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; You know how, from the first day that I have been

<P>with you until now, I have behaved myself among you, and what

<P>liberty and great privileges you have enjoyed under my

<P>government, I hope to your honour and mine, and also to your

<P>content and delight.&nbsp; Now, my famous Mansoul, a noise of

<P>trouble there is abroad, of trouble to the town of Mansoul;

<P>sorry I am thereof for your sakes: for I received but now by

<P>the post from my Lord Lucifer, (and he useth to have good

<P>intelligence,) that your old King Shaddai is raising an army

<P>to come against you, to destroy you root and branch; and

<P>this, O Mansoul, is now the cause that at this time I have

<P>called you together, namely, to advise what in this juncture

<P>is best to be done.&nbsp; For my part, I am but one, and can with

<P>ease shift for myself, did I list to seek my own case, and to

<P>leave my Mansoul in all the danger; but my heart is so firmly

<P>united to you, and so unwilling am I to leave you, that I am

<P>willing to stand and fall with you, to the utmost hazard that

<P>shall befall me.&nbsp; What say you, O my Mansoul?&nbsp; Will you now

<P>desert your old friend, or do you think of standing by me?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, as one man, with one mouth, they cried out together,

<P>'Let him die the death that will not.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Diabolus again, 'It is in vain for us to hope for

<P>quarter, for this King knows not how to show it.&nbsp; True,

<P>perhaps, he, at his first sitting down before us, will talk

<P>of and pretend to mercy, that thereby, with the more ease,

<P>and less trouble, he may again make himself the master of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Whatever, therefore, he shall say, believe not one

<P>syllable or tittle of it; for all such language is but to

<P>overcome us, and to make us, while we wallow in our blood,

<P>the trophies of his merciless victory.&nbsp; My mind is,

<P>therefore, that we resolve to the last man to resist him, and

<P>not to believe him upon any terms, for in at that door will

<P>come our danger.&nbsp; But shall we be flattered out of our lives?

<P>I hope you know more of the rudiments of politics than to

<P>suffer yourselves so pitifully to be served.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But suppose he should, if he get us to yield, save some of

<P>our lives, or the lives of some of them that are underlings

<P>in Mansoul, what help will that be to you that are the chief

<P>of the town, especially you whom I have set up and whose

<P>greatness has been procured by you through your faithful

<P>sticking to me?&nbsp; And suppose, again, that he should give

<P>quarter to every one of you, be sure he will bring you into

<P>that bondage under which you were captivated before, or a

<P>worse, and then what good will your lives do you?&nbsp; Shall you

<P>with him live in pleasure as you do now?&nbsp; No, no; you must be

<P>bound by laws that will pinch you, and be made to do that

<P>which at present is hateful to you.&nbsp; I am for you, if you are

<P>for me; and it is better to die valiantly than to live like

<P>pitiful slaves.&nbsp; But, I say, the life of a slave will be

<P>counted a life too good for Mansoul now.&nbsp; Blood, blood,

<P>nothing but blood is in every blast of Shaddai's trumpet

<P>against poor Mansoul now.&nbsp; Pray, be concerned; I hear he is

<P>coming.&nbsp; Up, and stand to your arms that now, while you have

<P>any leisure, I may learn you some feats of war.&nbsp; Armour for

<P>you I have, and by me it is; yea, and it is sufficient for

<P>Mansoul from top to toe; nor can you be hurt by what his

<P>force can do, if you shall keep it well girt and fastened

<P>about you.&nbsp; Come, therefore, to my castle, and welcome, and

<P>harness yourselves for the war.&nbsp; There is helmet,

<P>breastplate, sword, and shield, and what not, that will make

<P>you fight like men.
