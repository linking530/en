<P>'1. My helmet, otherwise called an head-piece, is in hope of

<P>doing well at last, what lives soever you live.&nbsp; This is that

<P>which they had who said, that they should have peace, though

<P>they walked in the wickedness of their heart, to add

<P>drunkenness to thirst.&nbsp; A piece of approved armour this is,

<P>and whoever has it, and can hold it, so long no arrow, dart,

<P>sword, or shield can hurt him.&nbsp; This, therefore, keep on, and

<P>thou wilt keep off many a blow, my Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. My breastplate is a breastplate of iron.&nbsp; I had it forged

<P>in mine own country, and all my soldiers are armed therewith.

<P>In plain language, it is a hard heart, a heart as hard as

<P>iron, and as much past feeling as a stone; the which if you

<P>get and keep, neither mercy shall win you, nor judgment

<P>fright you.&nbsp; This therefore, is a piece of armour most

<P>necessary for all to put on that hate Shaddai, and that would

<P>fight against him under my banner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. My sword is a tongue that is set on fire of hell, and

<P>that can bend itself to speak evil of Shaddai, his Son, his

<P>ways, and people.&nbsp; Use this; it has been tried a thousand

<P>times twice told.&nbsp; Whoever hath it, keeps it, and makes that

<P>use of it as I would have him, can never be conquered by mine

<P>enemy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'4. My, shield is unbelief, or calling into question the

<P>truth of the word, or all the sayings that speak of the

<P>judgment that Shaddai has appointed for wicked men.&nbsp; Use this

<P>shield; many attempts he has made upon it, and sometimes, it

<P>is true, it has been bruised; but they that have writ of the

<P>wars of Emmanuel against my servants, have testified that he

<P>could do no mighty work there because of their unbelief.

<P>Now, to handle this weapon of mine aright, it is not to

<P>believe things because they are true, of what sort or by

<P>whomsoever asserted.&nbsp; If he speaks of judgment, care not for

<P>it; if he speaks of mercy, care not for it; if he promises,

<P>if he swears that he would do to Mansoul, if it turns, no

<P>hurt, but good, regard not what is said, question the truth

<P>of all, for it is to wield the shield of unbelief aright, and

<P>as my servants ought and do; and he that doth otherwise loves

<P>me not, nor do I count him but an enemy to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'5. Another part or piece,' said Diabolus, 'of mine excellent

<P>armour is a dumb and prayerless spirit, a spirit that scorns

<P>to cry for mercy: wherefore be you, my Mansoul, sure that you

<P>make use of this.&nbsp; What! cry for quarter!&nbsp; Never do that,
if

<P>you would be mine.&nbsp; I know you are stout men, and am sure

<P>that I have clad you with that which is armour of proof.

<P>Wherefore, to cry to Shaddai for mercy, let that be far from

<P>you.&nbsp; Besides all this, I have a maul, firebrands, arrows,

<P>and death, all good hand-weapons, and such as will do

<P>execution.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After he had thus furnished his men with armour and arms, he

<P>addressed himself to them in such like words as these:

<P>'Remember,' quoth he, 'that I am your rightful king, and that

<P>you have taken an oath and entered into covenant to be true

<P>to me and my cause: I say, remember this, and show yourselves

<P>stout and valiant men of Mansoul.&nbsp; Remember also the kindness

<P>that I have always showed to you, and that without your

<P>petition I have granted to you external things; wherefore the

<P>privileges, grants, immunities, profits, and honours

<P>wherewith I have endowed you do call for, at your hands,

<P>returns of loyalty, my lion-like men of Mansoul: and when so

<P>fit a time to show it as when another shall seek to take my

<P>dominion over you into his own hands?&nbsp; One word more, and I

<P>have done.&nbsp; Can we but stand, and overcome this one shock or

<P>brunt, I doubt not but in little time all the world will be

<P>ours; and when that day comes, my true hearts, I will make

<P>you kings, princes, and captains, and what brave days shall

<P>we have then!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus having thus armed and forearmed his servants and

<P>vassals in Mansoul against their good and lawful King

<P>Shaddai, in the next place, he doubleth his guards at the

<P>gates of the town, and he takes himself to the castle, which

<P>was his stronghold.&nbsp; His vassals also, to show their wills,

<P>and supposed (but ignoble) gallantry, exercise themselves in

<P>their arms every day, and teach one another feats of war;

<P>they also defied their enemies, and sang up the praises of

<P>their tyrant; they threatened also what men they would be if

<P>ever things should rise so high as a war between Shaddai and

<P>their king.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now all this time the good King, the King Shaddai, was

<P>preparing to send an army to recover the town of Mansoul

<P>again from under the tyranny of their pretended king

<P>Diabolus; but he thought good, at first, not to send them by

<P>the hand and conduct of brave Emmanuel his Son, but under the

<P>hand of some of his servants, to see first by them the temper

<P>of Mansoul, and whether by them they would be won to the

<P>obedience of their King.&nbsp; The army consisted of above forty

<P>thousand, all true men, for they came from the King's own

<P>court, and were those of his own choosing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They came up to Mansoul under the conduct of four stout

<P>generals, each man being a captain of ten thousand men, and

<P>these are their names and their ensigns.&nbsp; The name of the

<P>first was Boanerges, the name of the second was Captain

<P>Conviction, the name of the third was Captain Judgment, and

<P>the name of the fourth was Captain Execution.&nbsp; These were the

<P>captains that Shaddai sent to regain Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These four captains, as was said, the King thought fit, in

<P>the first place, to send to Mansoul, to make an attempt upon

<P>it; for indeed generally in all his wars he did use to send

<P>these four captains in the van, for they were very stout and

<P>rough-hewn men, men that were fit to break the ice, and to

<P>make their way by dint of sword, and their men were like

<P>themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To each of these captains the King gave a banner, that it

<P>might be displayed, because of the goodness of his cause, and

<P>because of the right that he had to Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First, to Captain Boanerges, for he was the chief, to him, I

<P>say, were given ten thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign was Mr.

<P>Thunder; he bare the black colours, and his scutcheon was the

<P>three burning thunderbolts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The second captain was Captain Conviction; to him also were

<P>given ten thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign's name was Mr. Sorrow; he

<P>did bear the pale colours, and his scutcheon was the book of

<P>the law wide open, from whence issued a flame of fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The third captain was Captain Judgment; to him were given ten

<P>thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign's name was Mr. Terror; he bare the

<P>red colours, and his scutcheon was a burning fiery furnace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fourth captain was Captain Execution; to him were given

<P>ten thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign was one Mr. Justice; he also

<P>bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was a fruitless tree,

<P>with an axe lying at the root thereof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These four captains, as I said, had every one of them under

<P>his command ten thousand men, all of good fidelity to the

<P>King, and stout at their military actions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, the captains and their forces, their men and under

<P>officers, being had upon a day by Shaddai into the field, and

<P>there called all over by their names, were then and there put

<P>into such harness as became their degree and that service

<P>which now they were going about for their King.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the King had mustered his forces, (for it is he

<P>that mustereth the host to the battle,) he gave unto the

<P>captains their several commissions, with charge and

<P>commandment in the audience of all the soldiers, that they

<P>should take heed faithfully and courageously to do and

<P>execute the same.&nbsp; Their commissions were, for the substance

<P>of them, the same in form, though, as to name, title, place

<P>and degree of the captains, there might be some, but very

<P>small variation.&nbsp; And here let me give you an account of the

<P>matter and sum contained in their commission.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A COMMISSION FROM THE GREAT SHADDAI, KING OF MANSOUL, TO HIS

<P>TRUSTY AND NOBLE CAPTAIN, THE CAPTAIN BOANERGES, FOR HIS

<P>MAKING WAR UPON THE TOWN OF MANSOUL.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O, thou Boanerges, one of my stout and thundering captains

<P>over one ten thousand of my valiant and faithful servants, go

<P>thou in my name, with this thy force, to the miserable town

<P>of Mansoul; and when thou comest thither, offer them first

<P>conditions of peace; and command them that, casting off the

<P>yoke and tyranny of the wicked Diabolus, they return to me,

<P>their rightful Prince and Lord.&nbsp; Command them also that they

<P>cleanse themselves from all that is his in the town of

<P>Mansoul, and look to thyself, that thou hast good

<P>satisfaction touching the truth of their obedience.&nbsp; Thus

<P>when thou hast commanded them, (if they in truth submit

<P>thereto,) then do thou, to the uttermost of thy power, what

<P>in thee lies to set up for me a garrison in the famous town

<P>of Mansoul; nor do thou hurt the least native that moveth or

<P>breatheth therein, if they will submit themselves to me, but

<P>treat thou such as if they were thy friend or brother; for

<P>all such I love, and they shall be dear unto me, and tell

<P>them that I will take a time to come unto them, and to let

<P>them know that I am merciful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But if they shall, notwithstanding thy summons and the

<P>producing of thy authority, resist, stand out against thee,

<P>and rebel, then do I command thee to make use of all thy

<P>cunning, power, might, and force, to bring them under by

<P>strength of hand.&nbsp; Farewell.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus you see the sum of their commissions; for, as I said

<P>before, for the substance of them, they were the same that

<P>the rest of the noble captains had.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore they, having received each commander his authority

<P>at the hand of their King, the day being appointed, and the

<P>place of their rendezvous prefixed, each commander appeared

<P>in such gallantry as became his cause and calling.&nbsp; So, after

<P>a new entertainment from Shaddai, with flying colours they

<P>set forward to march towards the famous town of Mansoul.

<P>Captain Boanerges led the van, Captain Conviction and Captain

<P>Judgment made up the main body, and Captain Execution brought

<P>up the rear.&nbsp; They then, having a great way to go, (for the

<P>town of Mansoul was far off from the court of Shaddai,)

<P>marched through the regions and countries of many people, not

<P>hurting or abusing any, but blessing wherever they came.

<P>They also lived upon the King's cost in all the way they

<P>went.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having travelled thus for many days, at last they came within

<P>sight of Mansoul; the which when they saw, the captains could

<P>for their hearts do no less than for a while bewail the

<P>condition of the town; for they quickly saw how that it was

<P>prostrate to the will of Diabolus, and to his ways and

<P>designs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, to be short, the captains came up before the town,

<P>march up to Ear-gate, sit down there (for that was the place

<P>of hearing).&nbsp; So, when they had pitched their tents and

<P>entrenched themselves, they addressed themselves to make

<P>their assault.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now the townsfolk at first, beholding so gallant a company,

<P>so bravely accoutred, and so excellently disciplined, having

<P>on their glittering armour, and displaying of their flying

<P>colours, could not but come out of their houses and gaze.

<P>But the cunning fox Diabolus, fearing that the people, after

<P>this sight, should, on a sudden summons, open the gates to

<P>the captains, came down with all haste from the castle, and

<P>made them retire into the body of the town, who, when he had

<P>them there, made this lying and deceivable speech unto them:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'although you are my trusty and well-

<P>beloved friends, yet I cannot but a little chide you for your

<P>late uncircumspect action, in going out to gaze on that great

<P>and mighty force that but yesterday sat down before, and have

<P>now entrenched themselves in order to the maintaining of a

<P>siege against the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Do you know who

<P>they are, whence they come, and what is their purpose in

<P>sitting down before the town of Mansoul?&nbsp; They are they of

<P>whom I have told you long ago, that they would come to

<P>destroy this town, and against whom I have been at the cost

<P>to arm you with CAP-A-PIE for your body, besides great

<P>fortifications for your mind.&nbsp; Wherefore, then, did you not

<P>rather, even at the first appearance of them, cry out, "Fire

<P>the beacons!" and give the whole town an alarm concerning

<P>them, that we might all have been in a posture of defence,

<P>and been ready to have received them with the highest acts of

<P>defiance?&nbsp; Then had you showed yourselves men to my liking;

<P>whereas, by what you have done, you have made me half afraid

<P>- I say, half afraid - that when they and we shall come to

<P>push a pike, I shall find you want courage to stand it out

<P>any longer.&nbsp; Wherefore have I commanded a watch, and that you

<P>should double your guards at the gates?&nbsp; Wherefore have I

<P>endeavoured to make you as hard as iron, and your hearts as a

<P>piece of the nether millstone?&nbsp; Was it, think you, that you

<P>might show yourselves women, and that you might go out like a

<P>company of innocents to gaze on your mortal foes?&nbsp; Fie, fie!

<P>put yourselves into a posture of defence, beat up the drum,

<P>gather together in warlike manner, that our foes may know

<P>that, before they shall conquer this corporation, there are

<P>valiant men in the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I will leave off now to chide, and will not further rebuke

<P>you; but I charge you, that henceforwards you let me see no

<P>more such actions.&nbsp; Let not henceforward a man of you,

<P>without order first obtained from me, so much as show his

<P>head over the wall of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; You have now

<P>heard me; do as I have commanded, and you shall cause me that

<P>I dwell securely with you, and that I take care, as for

<P>myself, so for your safety and honour also.&nbsp; Farewell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now were the townsmen strangely altered; they were as men

<P>stricken with a panic fear; they ran to and fro through the

<P>streets of the town of Mansoul, crying out, 'Help, help! the

<P>men that turn the world upside down are come hither also.'

<P>Nor could any of them be quiet after; but still, as men

<P>bereft of wit, they cried out, 'The destroyers of our peace

<P>and people are come.'&nbsp; This went down with Diabolus.&nbsp; 'Ah,'

<P>quoth he to himself, 'this I like well: now it is as I would

<P>have it; now you show your obedience to your prince.&nbsp; Hold

<P>you but here, and then let them take the town if they can.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, before the King's forces had sat before Mansoul three

<P>days, Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go down to

<P>Ear-gate, and there, in the name of the great Shaddai, to

<P>summon Mansoul to give audience to the message that he, in

<P>his Master's name, was to them commanded to deliver.&nbsp; So the

<P>trumpeter, whose name was Take-heed-what-you-hear, went up,

<P>as he was commanded, to Ear-gate, and there sounded his

<P>trumpet for a hearing; but there was none that appeared that

<P>gave answer or regard, for so had Diabolus commanded.&nbsp; So the

<P>trumpeter returned to his captain, and told him what he had

<P>done, and also how he had sped; whereat the captain was

<P>grieved, but bid the trumpeter go to his tent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again Captain Boanerges sendeth his trumpeter to Ear-gate, to

<P>sound as before for a hearing; but they again kept close,

<P>came not out, nor would they give him an answer, so observant

<P>were they of the command of Diabolus their king.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the captains and other field officers called a council

<P>of war, to consider what further was to be done for the

<P>gaining of the town of Mansoul; and, after some close and

<P>thorough debate upon the contents of their commissions, they

<P>concluded yet to give to the town, by the hand of the fore-

<P>named trumpeter, another summons to hear; but if that shall

<P>be refused, said they, and that the town shall stand it out

<P>still, then they determined, and bid the trumpeter tell them

<P>so, that they would endeavour, by what means they could, to

<P>compel them by force to the obedience of their King.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go up to Ear-

<P>gate again, and, in the name of the great King Shaddai, to

<P>give it a very loud summons to come down without delay to

<P>Ear-gate, there to give audience to the King's most noble

<P>captains.&nbsp; So the trumpeter went, and did as he was

<P>commanded: he went up to Ear-gate, and sounded his trumpet,

<P>and gave a third summons to Mansoul.&nbsp; He said, moreover, that

<P>if this they should still refuse to do, the captains of his

<P>prince would with might come down upon them, and endeavour to

<P>reduce them to their obedience by force.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood up my Lord Willbewill, who was the governor of the

<P>town, (this Willbewill was that apostate of whom mention was

<P>made before,) and the keeper of the gates of Mansoul.&nbsp; He

<P>therefore, with big and ruffling words, demanded of the

<P>trumpeter who he was, whence he came, and what was the cause

<P>of his making so hideous a noise at the gate, and speaking

<P>such insufferable words against the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The trumpeter answered, 'I am servant to the most noble

<P>captain, Captain Boanerges, general of the forces of the

<P>great King Shaddai, against whom both thyself, with the whole

<P>town of Mansoul, have rebelled, and lift up the heel; and my

<P>master, the captain, hath a special message to this town, and

<P>to thee, as a member thereof; the which if you of Mansoul

<P>shall peaceably hear, so; and if not, you must take what

<P>follows.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Lord Willbewill, 'I will carry thy words to my

<P>lord, and will know what he will say.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the trumpeter soon replied, saying.&nbsp; 'Our message is not

<P>to the giant Diabolus, but to the miserable town of Mansoul;

<P>nor shall we at all regard what answer by him is made, nor

<P>yet by any for him.&nbsp; We are sent to this town to recover it

<P>from under his cruel tyranny, and to persuade it to submit,

<P>as in former times it did, to the most excellent King

<P>Shaddai.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Lord Willbewill, 'I will do your errand to the

<P>town.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The trumpeter then replied, 'Sir, do not deceive us, lest, in

<P>so doing, you deceive yourselves much more.'&nbsp; He added,

<P>moreover, 'For we are resolved, if in peaceable manner you do

<P>not submit yourselves, then to make a war upon you, and to

<P>bring you under by force.&nbsp; And of the truth of what I now

<P>say, this shall be a sign unto you, - you shall see the black

<P>flag, with its hot, burning thunder-bolts, set upon the mount

<P>to-morrow, as a token of defiance against your prince, and of

<P>our resolutions to reduce you to your Lord and rightful

<P>King.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the said Lord Willbewill returned from off the wall, and

<P>the trumpeter came into the camp.&nbsp; When the trumpeter was

<P>come into the camp, the captains and officers of the mighty

<P>King Shaddai came together to know if he had obtained a

<P>hearing, and what was the effect of his errand.&nbsp; So the

<P>trumpeter told, saying, 'When I had sounded my trumpet, and

<P>had called aloud to the town for a hearing, my Lord

<P>Willbewill, the governor of the town, and he that hath charge

<P>of the gates, came up when he heard me sound, and, looking

<P>over the wall, he asked me what I was, whence I came, and

<P>what was the cause of my making this noise.&nbsp; So I told him my

<P>errand, and by whose authority I brought it.&nbsp; "Then," said

<P>he, "I will tell it to the governor and to Mansoul;" and then

<P>I returned to my lords.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the brave Boanerges, 'Let us yet for a while lie

<P>still in our trenches, and see what these rebels will do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when the time drew nigh that audience by Mansoul must be

<P>given to the brave Boanerges and his companions, it was

<P>commanded that all the men of war throughout the whole camp

<P>of Shaddai should as one man stand to their arms, and make

<P>themselves ready, if the town of Mansoul shall hear, to

<P>receive it forthwith to mercy; but if not, to force a

<P>subjection.&nbsp; So the day being come, the trumpeters sounded,

<P>and that throughout the whole camp, that the men of war might

<P>be in a readiness for that which then should be the work of

<P>the day.&nbsp; But when they that were in the town of Mansoul

<P>heard the sound of the trumpets throughout the camp of

<P>Shaddai, and thinking no other but that it must be in order

<P>to storm the corporation, they at first were put to great

<P>consternation of spirit; but after they a little were settled

<P>again, they also made what preparation they could for a war,

<P>if they did storm; else, to secure themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when the utmost time was come, Boanerges was resolved

<P>to hear their answer; wherefore he sent out his trumpeter

<P>again to summon Mansoul to a hearing of the message that they

<P>had brought from Shaddai.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he went and sounded, and the townsmen came up, but made

<P>Ear-gate as sure as they could.&nbsp; Now when they were come up

<P>to the top of the wall, Captain Boanerges desired to see the

<P>Lord Mayor; but my Lord Incredulity was then Lord Mayor, for

<P>he came in the room of my Lord Lustings.&nbsp; So Incredulity came

<P>up and showed himself over the wall; but when the Captain

<P>Boanerges had set his eyes upon him, he cried out aloud,

<P>'This is not he: where is my Lord Understanding, the ancient

<P>Lord Mayor of the town of Mansoul? for to him I would deliver

<P>my message.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the giant (for Diabolus was also come down) to the

<P>captain, 'Mr.&nbsp; Captain, you have by your boldness given to

<P>Mansoul at least four summonses to subject herself to your

<P>King, by whose authority I know not, nor will I dispute that

<P>now.&nbsp; I ask, therefore, what is the reason of all this ado,

<P>or what would you be at if you knew yourselves?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Captain Boanerges, whose were the black colours, and

<P>whose scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts, taking no

<P>notice of the giant or of his speech, thus addressed himself

<P>to the town of Mansoul: 'Be it known unto you, O unhappy and

<P>rebellious Mansoul, that the most gracious King, the great

<P>King Shaddai, my Master, hath sent me unto you with

<P>commission' (and so he showed to the town his broad seal) 'to

<P>reduce you to his obedience; and he hath commanded me, in

<P>case you yield upon my summons, to carry it to you as if you

<P>were my friends or brethren; but he also hath bid, that if,

<P>after summons to submit you still stand out and rebel, we

<P>should endeavour to take you by force.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood forth Captain Conviction, and said, (his were the

<P>pale colours, and for a scutcheon he had the book of the law

<P>wide open, etc.,) 'Hear, O Mansoul!&nbsp; Thou, O Mansoul, wast

<P>once famous for innocency, but now thou art degenerated into

<P>lies and deceit.&nbsp; Thou hast heard what my brother, the

<P>Captain Boanerges, hath said; and it is your wisdom, and will

<P>be your happiness, to stoop to, and accept of conditions of

<P>peace and mercy when offered, specially when offered by one

<P>against whom thou hast rebelled, and one who is of power to

<P>tear thee in pieces, for so is Shaddai, our King; nor, when

<P>he is angry, can anything stand before him.&nbsp; If you say you

<P>have not sinned, or acted rebellion against our King, the

<P>whole of your doings since the day that you cast off his

<P>service (and there was the beginning of your sin) will

<P>sufficiently testify against you.&nbsp; What else means your

<P>hearkening to the tyrant, and your receiving him for your

<P>king?&nbsp; What means else your rejecting of the laws of Shaddai,

<P>and your obeying of Diabolus?&nbsp; Yea, what means this your

<P>taking up of arms against, and the shutting of your gates

<P>upon us, the faithful servants of your King?&nbsp; Be ruled then,

<P>and accept of my brother's invitation, and overstand not the

<P>time of mercy, but agree with thine adversary quickly.&nbsp; Ah,

<P>Mansoul! suffer not thyself to be kept from mercy, and to be

<P>run into a thousand miseries, by the flattering wiles of

<P>Diabolus.&nbsp; Perhaps that piece of deceit may attempt to make

<P>you believe that we seek our own profit in this our service,

<P>but know it is obedience to our King, and love to your

<P>happiness, that is the cause of this undertaking of ours.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Again I say to thee, O Mansoul, consider if it be not

<P>amazing grace that Shaddai should so humble himself as he

<P>doth: now he, by us, reasons with you, in a way of entreaty

<P>and sweet persuasions, that you would subject yourselves to

<P>him.&nbsp; Has he that need of you that we are sure you have of

<P>him?&nbsp; No, no; but he is merciful, and will not that Mansoul

<P>should die, but turn to him and live.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood forth Captain Judgment, whose were the red

<P>colours, and for a scutcheon he had the burning fiery

<P>furnace, and he said, 'O ye, the inhabitants of the town of

<P>Mansoul, that have lived so long in rebellion and acts of

<P>treason against the King Shaddai, know that we come not to-

<P>day to this place, in this manner, with our message of our

<P>own minds, or to revenge our own quarrel; it is the King, my

<P>Master, that hath sent us to reduce you to your obedience to

<P>him; the which if you refuse in a peaceable way to yield, we

<P>have commission to compel you thereto.&nbsp; And never think of

<P>yourselves, nor yet suffer the tyrant Diabolus to persuade

<P>you to think, that our King, by his power, is not able to

<P>bring you down, and to lay you under his feet; for he is the

<P>former of all things, and if he touches the mountains, they

<P>smoke.&nbsp; Nor will the gate of the King's clemency stand always

<P>open; for the day that shall burn like an oven is before him;

<P>yea, it hasteth greatly, it slumbereth not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O Mansoul, is it little in thine eyes that our King doth

<P>offer thee mercy, and that after so many provocations?&nbsp; Yea,

<P>he still holdeth out his golden sceptre to thee, and will not

<P>yet suffer his gate to be shut against thee: wilt thou

<P>provoke him to do it?&nbsp; If so, consider of what I say; to thee

<P>it is opened no more for ever.&nbsp; If thou sayest thou shalt not

<P>see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in

<P>him.&nbsp; Yea, because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee

<P>away with his stroke; then a great ransom cannot deliver

<P>thee.&nbsp; Will he esteem thy riches?&nbsp; No, not gold, nor all the

<P>forces of strength.&nbsp; He hath prepared his throne for

<P>judgment, for he will come with fire, and with his chariots

<P>like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his

<P>rebukes with flames of fire.&nbsp; Therefore, O Mansoul, take heed

<P>lest, after thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked,

<P>justice and judgment should take hold of thee.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now while the Captain Judgment was making this oration to the

<P>town of Mansoul, it was observed by some that Diabolus

<P>trembled; but he proceeded in his parable and said, 'O thou

<P>woful town of Mansoul, wilt thou not yet set open thy gate to

<P>receive us, the deputies of thy King, and those that would

<P>rejoice to see thee live?&nbsp; Can thine heart endure, or can thy

<P>hands be strong, in the day that he shall deal in judgment

<P>with thee?&nbsp; I say, canst thou endure to be forced to drink,

<P>as one would drink sweet wine, the sea of wrath that our King

<P>has prepared for Diabolus and his angels?&nbsp; Consider, betimes

<P>consider.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood forth the fourth captain, the noble Captain

<P>Execution, and said, 'O town of Mansoul, once famous, but now

<P>like the fruitless bough, once the delight of the high ones,

<P>but now a den for Diabolus, hearken also to me, and to the

<P>words that I shall speak to thee in the name of the great

<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; Behold, the axe is laid to the root of the trees:

<P>every tree, therefore, that bringeth not forth good fruit, is

<P>hewn down and cast into the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou, O town of Mansoul, hast hitherto been this fruitless

<P>tree; thou bearest nought but thorns and briars.&nbsp; Thy evil

<P>fruit bespeaks thee not to be a good tree; thy grapes are

<P>grapes of gall, thy clusters are bitter.&nbsp; Thou hast rebelled

<P>against thy King; and, lo! we, the power and force of

<P>Shaddai, are the axe that is laid to thy root.&nbsp; What sayest

<P>thou?&nbsp; Wilt thou turn?&nbsp; I say again, tell me, before the

<P>first blow is given, wilt thou turn?&nbsp; Our axe must first be

<P>laid TO thy root before it be laid AT thy root; it must first

<P>be laid TO thy root in a way of threatening, before it is

<P>laid AT thy root by way of execution; and between these two

<P>is required thy repentance, and this is all the time that

<P>thou hast.&nbsp; What wilt thou do?&nbsp; Wilt thou turn, or shall I

<P>smite?&nbsp; If I fetch my blow, Mansoul, down you go; for I have

<P>commission to lay my axe AT as well as TO thy roots, nor will

<P>anything but yielding to our King prevent doing of execution.

<P>What art thou fit for, O Mansoul, if mercy preventeth not,

<P>but to be hewn down, and cast into the fire and burned?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O Mansoul, patience and forbearance do not act for ever: a

<P>year, or two, or three, they may; but if thou provoke by a

<P>three years' rebellion, (and thou hast already done more than

<P>this,) then what follows but, 'Cut it down'? nay, 'After that

<P>thou shalt cut it down.'&nbsp; And dost thou think that these are

<P>but threatenings, or that our King has not power to execute

<P>his words?&nbsp; O Mansoul, thou wilt find that in the words of

<P>our King, when they are by sinners made little or light of,

<P>there is not only threatening, but burning coals of fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou hast been a cumber-ground long already, and wilt thou

<P>continue so still?&nbsp; Thy sin has brought this army to thy

<P>walls, and shall it bring it in judgment to do execution into

<P>thy town?&nbsp; Thou hast heard what the captains have said, but

<P>as yet thou shuttest thy gates.&nbsp; Speak out, Mansoul; wilt

<P>thou do so still, or wilt thou accept of conditions of

<P>peace?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These brave speeches of these four noble captains the town of

<P>Mansoul refused to hear; yet a sound thereof did beat against

<P>Ear-gate, though the force thereof could not break it open.

<P>In fine, the town desired a time to prepare their answer to

<P>these demands.&nbsp; The captains then told them, that if they

<P>would throw out to them one Ill-Pause that was in the town,

<P>that they might reward him according to his works, then they

<P>would give them time to consider; but if they would not cast

<P>him to them over the wall of Mansoul, then they would give

<P>them none; 'for,' said they, 'we know that, so long as Ill-

<P>Pause draws breath in Mansoul, all good consideration will be

<P>confounded, and nothing but mischief will come thereon.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Diabolus, who was there present, being loath to lose his

<P>Ill-Pause, because he was his orator, (and yet be sure he

<P>had, could the captains have laid their fingers on him,) was

<P>resolved at this instant to give them answer by himself; but

<P>then changing his mind, he commanded the then Lord Mayor, the

<P>Lord Incredulity, to do it, saying, 'My lord, do you give

<P>these runagates an answer, and speak out, that Mansoul may

<P>hear and understand you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Incredulity, at Diabolus' command, began, and said,

<P>'Gentlemen, you have here, as we do behold, to the

<P>disturbance of our prince and the molestation of the town of

<P>Mansoul, camped against it: but from whence you come, we will

<P>not know; and what you are, we will not believe.&nbsp; Indeed, you

<P>tell us in your terrible speech that you have this authority

<P>from Shaddai, but by what right he commands you to do it, of

<P>that we shall yet be ignorant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'You have also, by the authority aforesaid, summoned this

<P>town to desert her lord, and, for protection, to yield up

<P>herself to the great Shaddai, your King; flatteringly telling

<P>her, that if she will do it, he will pass by and not charge

<P>her with her past offences.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Further, you have also, to the terror of the town of

<P>Mansoul, threatened with great and sore destructions to

<P>punish this corporation, if she consents not to do as your

<P>wills would have her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, captains, from whencesoever you come, and though your

<P>designs be ever so right, yet know ye that neither my Lord

<P>Diabolus, nor I, his servant, Incredulity, nor yet our brave

<P>Mansoul, doth regard either your persons, message, or the

<P>King that you say hath sent you.&nbsp; His power, his greatness,

<P>his vengeance, we fear not; nor will we yield at all to your

<P>summons.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'As for the war that you threaten to make upon us, we must

<P>therein defend ourselves as well as we can; and know ye, that

<P>we are not without wherewithal to bid defiance to you; and,

<P>in short, (for I will not be tedious,) I tell you, that we

<P>take you to be some vagabond runagate crew, that having

<P>shaken off all obedience to your King, have gotten together

<P>in tumultuous manner, and are ranging from place to place to

<P>see if, through the flatteries you are skilled to make on the

<P>one side, and threats wherewith you think to fright on the

<P>other, to make some silly town, city, or country, desert

<P>their place, and leave it to you; but Mansoul is none of

<P>them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To conclude: we dread you not, we fear you not, nor will we

<P>obey your summons.&nbsp; Our gates we will shut upon you, our

<P>place we will keep you out of.&nbsp; Nor will we long thus suffer

<P>you to sit down before us: our people must live in quiet:

<P>your appearance doth disturb them.&nbsp; Wherefore arise with bag

<P>and baggage, and begone, or we will let fly from the walls

<P>against you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This oration, made by old Incredulity, was seconded by

<P>desperate Willbewill, in words to this effect: 'Gentlemen, we

<P>have heard your demands, and the noise of your threats, and

<P>have heard the sound of your summons; but we fear not your

<P>force, we regard not your threats, but will still abide as

<P>you found us.&nbsp; And we command you, that in three days' time

<P>you cease to appear in these parts, or you shall know what it

<P>is once to dare offer to rouse the lion Diabolus when asleep

<P>in his town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Recorder, whose name was Forget-Good, he also added as

<P>followeth: 'Gentlemen, my lords, as you see, have with mild

<P>and gentle words answered your rough and angry speeches: they

<P>have, moreover, in my hearing, given you leave quietly to

<P>depart as you came; wherefore, take their kindness and be

<P>gone.&nbsp; We might have come out with force upon you, and have

<P>caused you to feel the dint of our swords; but as we love

<P>ease and quiet ourselves, so we love not to hurt or molest

<P>others.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then did the town of Mansoul shout for joy, as if by Diabolus

<P>and his crew some great advantage had been gotten of the

<P>captains.&nbsp; They also rang the bells, and made merry, and

<P>danced upon the walls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus also returned to the castle, and the Lord Mayor and

<P>Recorder to their place; but the Lord Willbewill took special

<P>care that the gates should be secured with double guards,

<P>double bolts, and double locks and bars; and that Ear-gate

<P>especially might the better be looked to, for that was the

<P>gate in at which the King's forces sought most to enter.&nbsp; The

<P>Lord Willbewill made one old Mr. Prejudice, an angry and ill-

<P>conditioned fellow, captain of the ward at that gate, and put

<P>under his power sixty men, called deaf men; men advantageous

<P>for that service, forasmuch as they mattered no words of the

<P>captains, nor of the soldiers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when the captains saw the answer of the great ones, and

<P>that they could not get a hearing from the old natives of the

<P>town, and that Mansoul was resolved to give the King's army

<P>battle, they prepared themselves to receive them, and to try

<P>it out by the power of the arm.&nbsp; And, first, they made their

<P>force more formidable against Ear-gate; for they knew that,

<P>unless they could penetrate that, no good could be done upon

<P>the town.&nbsp; This done, they put the rest of their men in their

<P>places; after which, they gave out the word, which was, 'YE

<P>MUST BE BORN AGAIN.'&nbsp; Then they sounded the trumpet; then

<P>they in the town made them answer, with shout against shout,

<P>charge against charge, and so the battle began.&nbsp; Now they in

<P>the town had planted upon the tower over Ear-gate two great

<P>guns, the one called High-mind, and the other Heady.&nbsp; Unto

<P>these two guns they trusted much; they were cast in the

<P>castle by Diabolus' founder, whose name was Mr. Puff-up, and

<P>mischievous pieces they were.&nbsp; But so vigilant and watchful,

<P>when the captains saw them, were they, that though sometimes

<P>their shot would go by their ears with a whiz, yet they did

<P>them no harm.&nbsp; By these two guns the townsfolk made no

<P>question but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai, and well

<P>enough to secure the gate; but they had not much cause to

<P>boast of what execution they did, as by what follows will be

<P>gathered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The famous Mansoul had also some other small pieces in it, of

<P>the which they made use against the camp of Shaddai.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They from the camp also did as stoutly, and with as much of

<P>that as may in truth be called valour, let fly as fast at the

<P>town and at Ear-gate; for they saw that, unless they could

<P>break open Ear-gate, it would be but in vain to batter the

<P>wall.&nbsp; Now the King's captains had brought with them several

<P>slings, and two or three battering-rams; with their slings,

<P>therefore, they battered the houses and people of the town,

<P>and with their rams they sought to break Ear-gate open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The camp and the town had several skirmishes and brisk

<P>encounters, while the captains with their engines made many

<P>brave attempts to break open or beat down the tower that was

<P>over Ear-gate, and at the said gate to make their entrance;

<P>but Mansoul stood it out so lustily, through the rage of

<P>Diabolus, the valour of the Lord Willbewill, and the conduct

<P>of old Incredulity, the Mayor, and Mr. Forget-Good, the

<P>Recorder, that the charge and expense of that summer's wars,

<P>on the King's side, seemed to be almost quite lost, and the

<P>advantage to return to Mansoul.&nbsp; But when the captains saw

<P>how it was they made a fair retreat, and entrenched

<P>themselves in their winter quarters.&nbsp; Now, in this war, you

<P>must needs think there was much loss on both sides, of which

<P>be pleased to accept of this brief account following.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The King's captains, when they marched from the court to come

<P>up against Mansoul to war, as they came crossing over the

<P>country, they happened to light upon three young fellows that

<P>had a mind to go for soldiers: proper men they were, and men

<P>of courage and skill, to appearance.&nbsp; Their names were Mr.

<P>Tradition, Mr. Human-Wisdom, and Mr. Man's-Invention.&nbsp; So

<P>they came up to the captains, and proffered their service to

<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; The captains then told them of their design, and

<P>bid them not to be rash in their offers; but the young men

<P>told them they had considered the thing before, and that

<P>hearing they were upon their march for such a design, came

<P>hither on purpose to meet them, that they might be listed

<P>under their excellencies.&nbsp; Then Captain Boanerges, for that

<P>they were men of courage, listed them into his company, and

<P>so away they went to the war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the war was begun, in one of the briskest

<P>skirmishes, so it was, that a company of the Lord

<P>Willbewill's men sallied out at the sallyport or postern of

<P>the town, and fell in upon the rear of Captain Boanerges'

<P>men, where these three fellows happened to be; so they took

<P>them prisoners, and away they carried them into the town,

<P>where they had not lain long in durance, but it began to be

<P>noised about the streets of the town what three notable

<P>prisoners the Lord Willbewill's men had taken, and brought in

<P>prisoners out of the camp of Shaddai.&nbsp; At length tidings

<P>thereof were carried to Diabolus to the castle, to wit what

<P>my Lord Willbewill's men had done, and whom they had taken

<P>prisoners.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Diabolus called for Willbewill, to know the certainty of

<P>this matter.&nbsp; So he asked him, and he told him.&nbsp; Then did
the

<P>giant send for the prisoners, and, when they were come,

<P>demanded of them who they were, whence they came, and what

<P>they did in the camp of Shaddai; and they told him.&nbsp; Then he

<P>sent them to ward again.&nbsp; Not many days after, he sent for

<P>them to him again, and then asked them if they would be

<P>willing to serve him against their former captains.&nbsp; They

<P>then told him that they did not so much live by religion as

<P>by the fates of fortune; and that since his lordship was

<P>willing to entertain them, they should be willing to serve

<P>him.&nbsp; Now while things were thus in hand, there was one

<P>Captain Anything, a great doer, in the town of Mansoul; and

<P>to this Captain Anything did Diabolus send these men, and a

<P>note under his hand, to receive them into his company, the

<P>contents of which letter were thus:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Anything, my darling, - The three men that are the bearers

<P>of this letter have a desire to serve me in the war; nor know

<P>I better to whose conduct to commit them than to thine.

<P>Receive them, therefore, in my name, and, as need shall

<P>require, make use of them against Shaddai and his men.

<P>Farewell.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they came, and he received them; and he made of two of

<P>them sergeants; but he made Mr. Man's-Invention his ancient-

<P>bearer.&nbsp; But thus much for this, and now to return to the

<P>camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They of the camp did also some execution upon the town; for

<P>they did beat down the roof of the Lord Mayor's house, and so

<P>laid him more open than he was before.&nbsp; They had almost, with

<P>a sling, slain my Lord Willbewill outright; but he made a

<P>shift to recover again.&nbsp; But they made a notable slaughter

<P>among the aldermen, for with one only shot they cut off six

<P>of them; to wit, Mr. Swearing, Mr. Whoring, Mr. Fury, Mr.

<P>Stand-to-Lies, Mr. Drunkenness, and Mr. Cheating.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They also dismounted the two guns that stood upon the tower

<P>over Ear-gate, and laid them flat in the dirt.&nbsp; I told you

<P>before that the King's noble captains had drawn off to their

<P>winter quarters, and had there entrenched themselves and

<P>their carriages, so as with the best advantage to their King,

<P>and the greatest annoyance to the enemy, they might give

<P>seasonable and warm alarms to the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; And this

<P>design of them did so hit, that I may say they did almost

<P>what they would to the molestation of the corporation.&nbsp; For

<P>now could not Mansoul sleep securely as before, nor could

<P>they now go to their debaucheries with that quietness as in

<P>times past; for they had from the camp of Shaddai such

<P>frequent, warm, and terrifying alarms, yea, alarms upon

<P>alarms, first at one gate and then at another, and again at

<P>all the gates at once, that they were broken as to former

<P>peace.&nbsp; Yea, they had their alarms so frequently, and that

<P>when the nights were at longest, the weather coldest, and so

<P>consequently the season most unseasonable, that that winter

<P>was to the town of Mansoul a winter by itself.&nbsp; Sometimes the

<P>trumpets would sound, and sometimes the slings would whirl

<P>the stones into the town.&nbsp; Sometimes ten thousand of the

<P>King's soldiers would be running round the walls of Mansoul

<P>at midnight, shouting and lifting up the voice for the

<P>battle.&nbsp; Sometimes, again, some of them in the town would be

<P>wounded, and their cry and lamentable voice would be heard,

<P>to the great molestation of the now languishing town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, so distressed with those that laid siege

<P>against them were they, that, I dare say, Diabolus, their

<P>king, had in these days his rest much broken.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In these days, as I was informed, new thoughts, and thoughts

<P>that began to run counter one to another, began to possess

<P>the minds of the men of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Some would say,

<P>'There is no living thus.'&nbsp; Others would then reply, 'This

<P>will be over shortly.'&nbsp; Then would a third stand up and

<P>answer, 'Let us turn to the King Shaddai, and so put an end

<P>to these troubles.'&nbsp; And a fourth would come in with a fear,

<P>saying, 'I doubt he will not receive us.'&nbsp; The old gentleman,

<P>too, the Recorder, that was so before Diabolus took Mansoul,

<P>he also began to talk aloud, and his words were now to the

<P>town of Mansoul as if they were great claps of thunder.&nbsp; No

<P>noise now so terrible to Mansoul as was his, with the noise

<P>of the soldiers and shoutings of the captains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Also things began to grow scarce in Mansoul; now the things

<P>that her soul lusted after were departing from her.&nbsp; Upon all

<P>her pleasant things there was a blast, and burning instead of

<P>beauty.&nbsp; Wrinkles now, and some shows of the shadow of death,

<P>were upon the inhabitants of Mansoul.&nbsp; And now, O how glad

<P>would Mansoul have been to have enjoyed quietness and

<P>satisfaction of mind, though joined with the meanest

<P>condition in the world!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The captains also, in the deep of this winter, did send by

<P>the mouth of Boanerges' trumpeter a summons to Mansoul to

<P>yield up herself to the King, the great King Shaddai.&nbsp; They

<P>sent it once, and twice, and thrice; not knowing but that at

<P>some times there might be in Mansoul some willingness to

<P>surrender up themselves unto them, might they but have the

<P>colour of an invitation to do it under.&nbsp; Yea, so far as I

<P>could gather, the town had been surrendered up to them before

<P>now, had it not been for the opposition of old Incredulity,

<P>and the fickleness of the thoughts of my Lord Willbewill.

<P>Diabolus also began to rave; wherefore Mansoul, as to

<P>yielding, was not yet all of one mind; therefore they still

<P>lay distressed under these perplexing fears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I told you but now that they of the King's army had this

<P>winter sent three times to Mansoul to submit herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first time the trumpeter went he went with words of

<P>peace, telling them that the captains, the noble captains of

<P>Shaddai, did pity and bewail the misery of the now perishing

<P>town of Mansoul, and were troubled to see them so much to

<P>stand in the way of their own deliverance.&nbsp; He said,

<P>moreover, that the captains bid him tell them, that if now

<P>poor Mansoul would humble herself and turn, her former

<P>rebellions and most notorious treasons should by their

<P>merciful King be forgiven them, yea, and forgotten too.&nbsp; And

<P>having bid them beware that they stood not in their own way,

<P>that they opposed not themselves, nor made themselves their

<P>own losers, he returned again into the camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The second time the trumpeter went, he did treat them a

<P>little more roughly; for, after sound of trumpet, he told

<P>them that their continuing in their rebellion did but chafe

<P>and heat the spirit of the captains, and that they were

<P>resolved to make a conquest of Mansoul, or to lay their bones

<P>before the town walls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went again the third time, and dealt with them yet more

<P>roughly; telling them that now, since they had been so

<P>horribly profane, he did not know, not certainly know,

<P>whether the captains were inclining to mercy or judgment.

<P>'Only,' said he, 'they commanded me to give you a summons to

<P>open the gates unto them.'&nbsp; So he returned, and went into the

<P>camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These three summonses, and especially the last two, did so

<P>distress the town that they presently call a consultation,

<P>the result of which was this - That my Lord Willbewill should

<P>go up to Ear-gate, and there, with sound of trumpet, call to

<P>the captains of the camp for a parley.&nbsp; Well, the Lord

<P>Willbewill sounded upon the wall; so the captains came up in

<P>their harness, with their ten thousands at their feet.&nbsp; The

<P>townsmen then told the captains that they had heard and

<P>considered their summons, and would come to an agreement with

<P>them, and with their King Shaddai, upon such certain terms,

<P>articles, and propositions as, with and by the order of their

<P>prince, they to them were appointed to propound; to wit, they

<P>would agree upon these grounds to be one people with them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. If that those of their own company, as the now Lord Mayor

<P>and their Mr. Forget-Good, with then brave Lord Willbewill,

<P>might, under Shaddai, be still the governors of the town,

<P>castle, and gates of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. Provided that no man that now serveth under their great

<P>giant Diabolus be by Shaddai cast out of house, harbour, or

<P>the freedom that he hath hitherto enjoyed in the famous town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. That it shall be granted them, that they of the town of

<P>Mansoul shall enjoy certain of their rights and privileges;

<P>to wit, such as have formerly been granted them, and that

<P>they have long lived in the enjoyment of, under the reign of

<P>their king Diabolus, that now is, and long has been, their

<P>only lord and great defender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. That no new law, officer, or executioner of law or office,

<P>shall have any power over them, without their own choice and

<P>consent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'These be our propositions, or conditions of peace; and upon

<P>these terms,' said they, 'we will submit to your King.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when the captains had heard this weak and feeble offer of

<P>the town of Mansoul, and their high and bold demands, they

<P>made to them again, by their noble captain, the Captain

<P>Boanerges, this speech following:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O ye inhabitants of the town of Mansoul, when I heard your

<P>trumpet sound for a parley with us, I can truly say I was

<P>glad; but when you said you were willing to submit yourselves

<P>to our King and Lord, then I was yet more glad; but when, by

<P>your silly provisos and foolish cavils, you laid the

<P>stumbling-block of your iniquity before your own faces, then

<P>was my gladness turned into sorrows, and my hopeful

<P>beginnings of your return, into languishing fainting fears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I count that old Ill-Pause, the ancient enemy of Mansoul,

<P>did draw up those proposals that now you present us with as

<P>terms of an agreement; but they deserve not to be admitted to

<P>sound in the ear of any man that pretends to have service for

<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; We do therefore jointly, and that with the highest

<P>disdain, refuse and reject such things, as the greatest of

<P>iniquities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But, O Mansoul, if you will give yourselves into our hands,

<P>or rather into the hands of our King, and will trust him to

<P>make such terms with and for you as shall seem good in his

<P>eyes, (and I dare say they shall be such as you shall find to

<P>be most profitable to you,) then we will receive you, and be

<P>at peace with you; but if you like not to trust yourselves in

<P>the arms of Shaddai our King, then things are but where they

<P>were before, and we know also what we have to do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then cried out old Incredulity, the Lord Mayor, and said,

<P>'And who, being out of the hands of their enemies, as ye see

<P>we are now, will be so foolish as to put the staff out of

<P>their own hands into the hands of they know not who?&nbsp; I, for

<P>my part, will never yield to so unlimited a proposition.&nbsp; Do

<P>we know the manner and temper of their King?&nbsp; It is said by

<P>some that he will be angry with his subjects if but the

<P>breadth of an hair they chance to step out of the way; and by

<P>others, that he requireth of them much more than they can

<P>perform.&nbsp; Wherefore, it seems, O Mansoul, to be thy wisdom to

<P>take good heed what thou dost in this matter; for if you once

<P>yield, you give up yourselves to another, and so you are no

<P>more your own.&nbsp; Wherefore, to give up yourselves to an

<P>unlimited power, is the greatest folly in the world; for now

<P>you indeed may repent, but can never justly complain.&nbsp; But do

<P>you indeed know, when you are his, which of you he will kill,

<P>and which of you he will save alive; or whether he will not

<P>cut off every one of us, and send out of his own country

<P>another new people, and cause them to inhabit this town?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This speech of the Lord Mayor undid all, and threw flat to

<P>the ground their hopes of an accord.&nbsp; Wherefore the captains

<P>returned to their trenches, to their tents, and to their men,

<P>as they were; and the Mayor to the castle and to his King.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Diabolus had waited for his return, for he had heard that

<P>they had been at their points.&nbsp; So, when he was come into the

<P>chamber of state, Diabolus saluted him with - 'Welcome, my

<P>lord.&nbsp; How went matters betwixt you to-day?'&nbsp; So the Lord

<P>Incredulity, with a low congee, told him the whole of the

<P>matter, saying, 'Thus and thus said the captains of Shaddai,

<P>and thus and thus said I.'&nbsp; The which when it was told to

<P>Diabolus, he was very glad to hear it, and said, 'My Lord

<P>Mayor, my faithful Incredulity, I have proved thy fidelity

<P>above ten times already, but never yet found thee false.&nbsp; I

<P>do promise thee, if we rub over this brunt, to prefer thee to

<P>a place of honour, a place far better than to be Lord Mayor

<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; I will make thee my universal deputy, and thou

<P>shalt, next to me, have all nations under thy hand; yea, and

<P>thou shalt lay bands upon them, that they may not resist

<P>thee; nor shall any of our vassals walk more at liberty, but

<P>those that shall be content to walk in thy fetters.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now came the Lord Mayor out from Diabolus, as if he had

<P>obtained a favour indeed.&nbsp; Wherefore to his habitation he

<P>goes in great state, and thinks to feed himself well enough

<P>with hopes, until the time came that his greatness should be

<P>enlarged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now, though the Lord Mayor and Diabolus did thus well

<P>agree, yet this repulse to the brave captains put Mansoul

<P>into a mutiny.&nbsp; For while old Incredulity went into the

<P>castle to congratulate his lord with what had passed, the old

<P>Lord Mayor, that was so before Diabolus came to the town, to

<P>wit, my Lord Understanding, and the old Recorder, Mr.

<P>Conscience, getting intelligence of what had passed at Ear-

<P>gate, (for you must know that they might not be suffered to

<P>be at that debate, lest they should then have mutinied for

<P>the captains; but, I say, they got intelligence of what had

<P>passed there, and were much concerned therewith,) wherefore

<P>they, getting some of the town together, began to possess

<P>them with the reasonableness of the noble captains' demands,

<P>and with the bad consequences that would follow upon the

<P>speech of old Incredulity, the Lord Mayor; to wit how little

<P>reverence he showed therein either to the captains or to

<P>their King; also how he implicitly charged them with

<P>unfaithfulness and treachery.&nbsp; 'For what less,' quoth they,

<P>'could be made of his words, when he said he would not yield

<P>to their proposition; and added, moreover, a supposition that

<P>he would destroy us, when before he had sent us word that he

<P>would show us mercy!'&nbsp; The multitude, being now possessed

<P>with the conviction of the evil that old Incredulity had

<P>done, began to run together by companies in all places, and

<P>in every corner of the streets of Mansoul; and first they

<P>began to mutter, then to talk openly, and after that they run

<P>to and fro, and cried as they run, 'Oh the brave captains of

<P>Shaddai! would we were under the government of the captains,

<P>and of Shaddai their King!'&nbsp; When the Lord Mayor had

<P>intelligence that Mansoul was in an uproar, down he comes to

<P>appease the people, and thought to have quashed their heat

<P>with the bigness and the show of his countenance; but when

<P>they saw him, they came running upon him, and had doubtless

<P>done him a mischief, had he not betaken himself to house.

<P>However, they strongly assaulted the house where he was, to

<P>have pulled it down about his ears; but the place was too

<P>strong, so they failed of that.&nbsp; So he, taking some courage,

<P>addressed himself, out at a window, to the people in this

<P>manner:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen, what is the reason that there is here such an

<P>uproar to-day?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then answered my Lord Understanding, 'It is even because that

<P>thou and thy master have carried it not rightly, and as you

<P>should, to the captains of Shaddai; for in three things you

<P>are faulty.&nbsp; First, in that you would not let Mr. Conscience

<P>and myself be at the hearing of your discourse.&nbsp; Secondly, in

<P>that you propounded such terms of peace to the captains that

<P>by no means could be granted, unless they had intended that

<P>their Shaddai should have been only a titular prince, and

<P>that Mansoul should still have had power by law to have lived

<P>in all lewdness and vanity before him, and so by consequence

<P>Diabolus should still here be king in power, and the other

<P>only king in name.&nbsp; Thirdly, for that thou didst thyself,

<P>after the captains had showed us upon what conditions they

<P>would have received us to mercy, even undo all again with thy

<P>unsavoury, unseasonable, and ungodly speech.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When old Incredulity had heard this speech, he cried out,

<P>'Treason! treason!&nbsp; To your arms! to your arms!&nbsp; O ye, the

<P>trusty friends of Diabolus in Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>UND. - Sir, you may put upon my words what meaning you

<P>please; but I am sure that the captains of such an high lord

<P>as theirs is, deserved a better treatment at your hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said old Incredulity, 'This is but little better.&nbsp; But,

<P>Sir,' quoth he, 'what I spake I spake for my prince, for his

<P>government, and the quieting of the people, whom by your

<P>unlawful actions you have this day set to mutiny against us.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then replied the old Recorder, whose name was Mr. Conscience,

<P>and said, 'Sir, you ought not thus to retort upon what my

<P>Lord Understanding hath said.&nbsp; It is evident enough that he

<P>hath spoken the truth, and that you are an enemy to Mansoul.

<P>Be convinced, then, of the evil of your saucy and malapert

<P>language, and of the grief that you have put the captains to;

<P>yea, and of the damages that you have done to Mansoul

<P>thereby.&nbsp; Had you accepted of the conditions, the sound of

<P>the trumpet and the alarm of war had now ceased about the

<P>town of Mansoul; but that dreadful sound abides, and your

<P>want of wisdom in your speech has been the cause of it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said old Incredulity, 'Sir, if I live, I will do your

<P>errand to Diabolus, and there you shall have an answer to

<P>your words.&nbsp; Meanwhile we will seek the good of the town, and

<P>not ask counsel of you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>UND. - Sir, your prince and you are both foreigners to

<P>Mansoul, and not the natives thereof; and who can tell but

<P>that, when you have brought us into greater straits, (when

<P>you also shall see that yourselves can be safe by no other

<P>means than by flight,) you may leave us and shift for

<P>yourselves, or set us on fire, and go away in the smoke, or

<P>by the light of our burning, and so leave us in our ruins?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INCRED. - Sir, you forget that you are under a governor, and

<P>that you ought to demean yourself like a subject; and know

<P>ye, when my lord the king shall hear of this day's work, he

<P>will give you but little thanks for your labour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now while these gentlemen were thus in their chiding words,

<P>down come from the walls and gates of the town the Lord

<P>Willbewill, Mr. Prejudice, old Ill-Pause, and several of the

<P>new-made aldermen and burgesses, and they asked the reason of

<P>the hubbub and tumult; and with that every man began to tell

<P>his own tale, so that nothing could be heard distinctly.

<P>Then was a silence commanded, and the old fox Incredulity

<P>began to speak.&nbsp; 'My lord,' quoth he, 'here are a couple of

<P>peevish gentlemen, that have, as a fruit of their bad

<P>dispositions, and, as I fear, through the advice of one Mr.

<P>Discontent, tumultuously gathered this company against me

<P>this day, and also attempted to run the town into acts of

<P>rebellion against our prince.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then stood up all the Diabolonians that were present, and

<P>affirmed these things to be true.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when they that took part with my Lord Understanding and

<P>with Mr. Conscience perceived that they were like to come to

<P>the worst, for that force and power was on the other side,

<P>they came in for their help and relief; so a great company

<P>was on both sides.&nbsp; Then they on Incredulity's side would

<P>have had the two old gentlemen presently away to prison; but

<P>they on the other side said they should not.&nbsp; Then they began

<P>to cry up parties again: the Diabolonians cried up old

<P>Incredulity, Forget-Good, the new aldermen, and their great

<P>one Diabolus; and the other party, they as fast cried up

<P>Shaddai, the captains, his laws, their mercifulness, and

<P>applauded their conditions and ways.&nbsp; Thus the bickerment

<P>went awhile; at last they passed from words to blows, and now

<P>there were knocks on both sides.&nbsp; The good old gentleman, Mr.

<P>Conscience, was knocked down twice by one of the

<P>Diabolonians, whose name was Mr. Benumbing; and my Lord

<P>Understanding had like to have been slain with an arquebuse,

<P>but that he that shot did not take his aim aright.&nbsp; Nor did

<P>the other side wholly escape; for there was one Mr. Rashhead,

<P>a Diabolonian, that had his brains beaten out by Mr. Mind,

<P>the Lord Willbewill's servant; and it made me laugh to see

<P>how old Mr. Prejudice was kicked and tumbled about in the

<P>dirt; for though, a while since, he was made captain of a

<P>company of the Diabolonians, to the hurt and damage of the

<P>town, yet now they had got him under their feet, and, I'll

<P>assure you, he had, by some of the Lord Understanding's

<P>party, his crown cracked to boot.&nbsp; Mr. Anything also, he

<P>became a brisk man in the broil; but both sides were against

<P>him, because he was true to none.&nbsp; Yet he had, for his

<P>malapertness, one of his legs broken, and he that did it

<P>wished it had been his neck.&nbsp; Much more harm was done on both

<P>sides, but this must not be forgotten; it was now a wonder to

<P>see my Lord Willbewill so indifferent as he was: he did not

<P>seem to take one side more than another, only it was

<P>perceived that he smiled to see how old Prejudice was tumbled

<P>up and down in the dirt.&nbsp; Also, when Captain Anything came

<P>halting up before him, he seemed to take but little notice of

<P>him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the uproar was over, Diabolus sends for my Lord

<P>Understanding and Mr. Conscience, and claps them both up in

<P>prison as the ringleaders and managers of this most heavy,

<P>riotous rout in Mansoul.&nbsp; So now the town began to be quiet

<P>again, and the prisoners were used hardly; yea, he thought to

<P>have made them away, but that the present juncture did not

<P>serve for that purpose, for that war was in all their gates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But let us return again to our story.&nbsp; The captains, when

<P>they were gone back from the gate, and were come into the

<P>camp again, called a council of war, to consult what was

<P>further for them to do.&nbsp; Now, some said, 'Let us go up

<P>presently, and fall upon the town;' but the greatest part

<P>thought rather better it would be to give them another

<P>summons to yield; and the reason why they thought this to be

<P>best was, because that, so far as could be perceived, the

<P>town of Mansoul now was more inclinable than heretofore.

<P>'And if,' said they, 'while some of them are in a way of

<P>inclination, we should by ruggedness give them distaste, we

<P>may set them further from closing with our summons than we

<P>would be willing they should.'&nbsp; Wherefore to this advice they

<P>agreed, and called a trumpeter, put words into his mouth, set

<P>him his time, and bid him God speed.&nbsp; Well, many hours were

<P>not expired before the trumpeter addressed himself to his

<P>journey.&nbsp; Wherefore, coming up to the wall of the town, he

<P>steereth his course to Ear-gate, and there sounded, as he was

<P>commanded.&nbsp; They then that were within came out to see what

<P>was the matter, and the trumpeter made them this speech

<P>following:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O hard-hearted and deplorable town of Mansoul, how long wilt

<P>thou love thy sinful, sinful simplicity, and, ye fools,

<P>delight in your scorning?&nbsp; As yet despise you the offers of

<P>peace and deliverance?&nbsp; As yet will ye refuse the golden

<P>offers of Shaddai, and trust to the lies and falsehoods of

<P>Diabolus?&nbsp; Think you, when Shaddai shall have conquered you,

<P>that the remembrance of these your carriages towards him will

<P>yield you peace and comfort, or that by ruffling language you

<P>can make him afraid as a grasshopper?&nbsp; Doth he entreat you

<P>for fear of you?&nbsp; Do you think that you are stronger than he?

<P>Look to the heavens, and behold and consider the stars, how

<P>high are they?&nbsp; Can you stop the sun from running his course,

<P>and hinder the moon from giving her light?&nbsp; Can you count the

<P>number of the stars, or stay the bottles of heaven?&nbsp; Can you

<P>call for the waters of the sea, and cause them to cover the

<P>face of the ground?&nbsp; Can you behold every one that is proud,

<P>and abase him, and bind their faces in secret?&nbsp; Yet these are

<P>some of the works of our King, in whose name this day we come

<P>up unto you, that you may be brought under his authority.&nbsp; In

<P>his name, therefore, I summon you again to yield up

<P>yourselves to his captains.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this summons the Mansoulians seemed to be at a stand, and

<P>knew not what answer to make.&nbsp; Wherefore Diabolus forthwith

<P>appeared, and took upon him to do it himself; and thus he

<P>begins, but turns his speech to them of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'and my faithful subjects, if it is

<P>true that this summoner hath said concerning the greatness of

<P>their King, by his terror you will always be kept in bondage,

<P>and so be made to sneak.&nbsp; Yea, how can you now, though he is

<P>at a distance, endure to think of such a mighty one?&nbsp; And if

<P>not to think of him while at a distance, how can you endure

<P>to be in his presence?&nbsp; I, your prince, am familiar with you,

<P>and you may play with me as you would with a grasshopper.

<P>Consider, therefore, what is for your profit, and remember

<P>the immunities that I have granted you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Farther, if all be true that this man hath said, how comes

<P>it to pass that the subjects of Shaddai are so enslaved in

<P>all places where they come?&nbsp; None in the universe so unhappy

<P>as they, none so trampled upon as they.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Consider, my Mansoul: would thou wert as loath to leave me

<P>as I am loath to leave thee.&nbsp; But consider, I say, the ball

<P>is yet at thy foot; liberty you have, if you know how to use

<P>it; yea, a king you have too, if you can tell how to love and

<P>obey him.'
