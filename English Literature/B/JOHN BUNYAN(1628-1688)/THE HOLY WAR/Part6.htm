<P>Now when Emmanuel perceived that through the policy of Mr.

<P>Carnal-Security the hearts of the men of Mansoul were chilled

<P>and abated in their practical love to him,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First.&nbsp; He bemoans them, and, condoles their state with the

<P>Secretary, saying, 'Oh that my people had hearkened unto me,

<P>and that Mansoul had walked in my ways!&nbsp; I would have fed

<P>them with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the

<P>rock would I have sustained them.'&nbsp; This done, he said in his

<P>heart, 'I will return to the court, and go to my place, till

<P>Mansoul shall consider and acknowledge their offence.'&nbsp; And

<P>he did so, and the cause and manner of his going away from

<P>them was, that Mansoul declined him, as is manifest in these

<P>particulars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'1. They left off their former way of visiting him, they came

<P>not to his royal palace as afore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. They did not regard, nor yet take notice, that he came or

<P>came not to visit them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. The love-feasts that had wont to be between their Prince

<P>and them, though he made them still, and called them to them,

<P>yet they neglected to come to them, or to be delighted with

<P>them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'4. They waited not for his counsels, but began to be

<P>headstrong and confident in themselves, concluding that now

<P>they were strong and invincible, and that Mansoul was secure,

<P>and beyond all reach of the foe, and that her state must

<P>needs be unalterable for ever.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, as was said, Emmanuel perceiving that by the craft of

<P>Mr. Carnal-Security, the town of Mansoul was taken off from

<P>their dependence upon him, and upon his Father by him, and

<P>set upon what by them was bestowed upon it; he first, as I

<P>said, bemoaned their state, then he used means to make them

<P>understand that the way that they went on in was dangerous:

<P>for he sent my Lord High Secretary to them, to forbid them

<P>such ways; but twice when he came to them, he found them at

<P>dinner in Mr. Carnal-Security's parlour; and perceiving also

<P>that they were not willing to reason about matters concerning

<P>their good, he took grief and went his way; the which when he

<P>had told to the Prince Emmanuel, he took offence, and was

<P>grieved also, and so made provision to return to his Father's

<P>court.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the methods of his withdrawing, as I was saying before,

<P>were thus:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'1. Even while he was yet with them in Mansoul, he kept

<P>himself close, and more retired than formerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. His speech was not now, if he came in their company, so

<P>pleasant and familiar as formerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. Nor did he, as in times past, send to Mansoul, from his

<P>table, those dainty bits which he was wont to do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'4. Nor when they came to visit him, as now and then they

<P>would, would he be so easily spoken with as they found him to

<P>be in times past.&nbsp; They might now knock once, yea, twice, but

<P>he would seem not at all to regard them; whereas formerly at

<P>the sound of their feet he would up and run, and meet them

<P>halfway, and take them too, and lay them in his bosom.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But thus Emmanuel carried it now, and by this his carriage he

<P>sought to make them bethink themselves, and return to him.

<P>But, alas! they did not consider, they did not know his ways,

<P>they regarded not, they were not touched with these, nor with

<P>the true remembrance of former favours.&nbsp; Wherefore what does

<P>he but in private manner withdraw himself, first from his

<P>palace, then to the gate of the town, and so away from

<P>Mansoul he goes, till they should acknowledge their offence,

<P>and more earnestly seek his face.&nbsp; Mr. God's-Peace also laid

<P>down his commission, and would for the present act no longer

<P>in the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus they walked contrary to him, and he again, by way of

<P>retaliation, walked contrary to them.&nbsp; But, alas! by this

<P>time they were so hardened in their way, and had so drunk in

<P>the doctrine of Mr. Carnal-Security, that the departing of

<P>their Prince touched them not, nor was he remembered by them

<P>when gone; and so, of consequence, his absence not condoled

<P>by them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, there was a day wherein this old gentleman, Mr. Carnal-

<P>Security, did again make a feast for the town of Mansoul; and

<P>there was at that time in the town one Mr. Godly-Fear, one

<P>now but little set by, though formerly one of great request.

<P>This man, old Carnal-Security, had a mind, if possible, to

<P>gull, and debauch, and abuse, as he did the rest, and

<P>therefore he now bids him to the feast with his neighbours.

<P>So the day being come, they prepare, and he goes and appears

<P>with the rest of the guests; and being all set at the table,

<P>they did eat and drink, and were merry, even all but this one

<P>man: for Mr. Godly-Fear sat like a stranger, and did neither

<P>eat nor was merry.&nbsp; The which, when Mr. Carnal-Security

<P>perceived, he presently addressed himself in a speech thus to

<P>him:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Mr. Godly-Fear, are you not well?&nbsp; You seem to be ill of

<P>body or mind, or both.&nbsp; I have a cordial of Mr. Forget-Good's

<P>making, the which, sir, if you will take a dram of, I hope it

<P>may make you bonny and blithe, and so make you more fit for

<P>us, feasting companions.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Unto whom the good old gentleman discreetly replied, 'Sir, I

<P>thank you for all things courteous and civil; but for your

<P>cordial I have no list thereto.&nbsp; But a word to the natives of

<P>Mansoul: You, the elders and chief of Mansoul, to me it is

<P>strange to see you so jocund and merry, when the town of

<P>Mansoul is in such woeful case.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Carnal-Security, 'You want sleep, good air, I

<P>doubt.&nbsp; If you please, lie down, and take a nap, and we

<P>meanwhile will be merry.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the good man as follows: 'Sir, if you were not

<P>destitute of an honest heart, you could not do as you have

<P>done and do.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Carnal-Security, 'Why?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GODLY.&nbsp; Nay, pray interrupt me not.&nbsp; It is true the town of

<P>Mansoul was strong, and, with a PROVISO, impregnable; but

<P>you, the townsmen, have weakened it, and it now lies

<P>obnoxious to its foes.&nbsp; Nor is it a time to flatter, or be

<P>silent; it is you, Mr. Carnal-Security, that have wilily

<P>stripped Mansoul, and driven her glory from her; you have

<P>pulled down her towers, you have broken down her gates, you

<P>have spoiled her locks and bars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now, to explain myself: from that time that my lords of

<P>Mansoul, and you, sir, grew so great, from that time the

<P>Strength of Mansoul has been offended, and now he is arisen

<P>and is gone.&nbsp; If any shall question the truth of my words, I

<P>will answer him by this, and suchlike questions.&nbsp; 'Where is

<P>the Prince Emmanuel?&nbsp; When did a man or woman in Mansoul see

<P>him?&nbsp; When did you hear from him, or taste any of his dainty

<P>bits?'&nbsp; You are now a feasting with this Diabolonian monster,

<P>but he is not your Prince.&nbsp; I say, therefore, though enemies

<P>from without, had you taken heed, could not have made a prey

<P>of you, yet since you have sinned against your Prince, your

<P>enemies within have been too hard for you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Carnal-Security, 'Fie! fie!&nbsp; Mr. Godly-Fear,

<P>fie! - will you never shake off your TIMOROUSNESS?&nbsp; Are you

<P>afraid of being sparrow-blasted?&nbsp; Who hath hurt you?&nbsp; Behold,

<P>I am on your side; only you are for doubting, and I am for

<P>being confident.&nbsp; Besides, is this a time to be sad in?&nbsp; A

<P>feast is made for mirth; why, then, do you now, to your

<P>shame, and our trouble, break out into such passionate

<P>melancholy language, when you should eat and drink, and be

<P>merry?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Godly-Fear again, 'I may well be sad, for

<P>Emmanuel is gone from Mansoul.&nbsp; I say again, he is gone, and

<P>you, sir, are the man that has driven him away; yea, he is

<P>gone without so much as acquainting the nobles of Mansoul

<P>with his going; and if that is not a sign of his anger, I am

<P>not acquainted with the methods of godliness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And now, my lords and gentlemen, for my speech is still to

<P>you, your gradual declining from him did provoke him

<P>gradually to depart from you, the which he did for some time,

<P>if perhaps you would have been made sensible thereby, and

<P>have been renewed by humbling yourselves; but when he saw

<P>that none would regard, nor lay these fearful beginnings of

<P>his anger and judgment to heart, he went away from this

<P>place; and this I saw with mine eye.&nbsp; Wherefore now, while

<P>you boast, your strength is gone; you are like the man that

<P>had lost his locks that before did wave about his shoulders.

<P>You may, with this lord of your feast, shake yourselves, and

<P>conclude to do as at other times; but since without him you

<P>can do nothing, and he is departed from you, turn your feast

<P>into a sigh, and your mirth into lamentation.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the subordinate preacher, old Mr. Conscience by name, he

<P>that of old was Recorder of Mansoul, being startled at what

<P>was said, began to second it thus:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Indeed, my brethren,' quoth he, 'I fear that Mr. Godly-Fear

<P>tells us true: I, for my part, have not seen my Prince a long

<P>season.&nbsp; I cannot remember the day, for my part; nor can I

<P>answer Mr. Godly-Fear's question.&nbsp; I doubt, I am afraid that

<P>all is nought with Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GODLY.&nbsp; Nay, I know that you shall not find him in Mansoul,

<P>for he is departed and gone; yea, and gone for the faults of

<P>the elders, and for that they rewarded his grace with

<P>unsufferable unkindness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then did the subordinate preacher look as if he would fall

<P>down dead at the table; also all there present, except the

<P>man of the house, began to look pale and wan.&nbsp; But having a

<P>little recovered themselves, and jointly agreeing to believe

<P>Mr. Godly-Fear and his sayings, they began to consult what

<P>was best to be done, (now Mr. Carnal-Security was gone into

<P>his withdrawing-room, for he liked not such dumpish doings,)

<P>both to the man of the house for drawing them into evil, and

<P>also to recover Emmanuel's love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And, with that, that saying of their Prince came very hot

<P>into their minds, which he had bidden them do to such as were

<P>false prophets that should arise to delude the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; So they took Mr. Carnal-Security (concluding that

<P>he must be he) and burned his house upon him with fire; for

<P>he also was a Diabolonian by nature.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when this was passed and over, they bespeed themselves to

<P>look for Emmanuel their Prince; and they sought him, but they

<P>found him not.&nbsp; Then were they more confirmed in the truth of

<P>Mr. Godly-Fear's sayings, and began also severely to reflect

<P>upon themselves for their so vile and ungodly doings; for

<P>they concluded now that it was through them that their Prince

<P>had left them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they agreed and went to my Lord Secretary, (him whom

<P>before they refused to hear - him whom they had grieved with

<P>their doings,) to know of him, for he was a seer, and could

<P>tell where Emmanuel was, and how they might direct a petition

<P>to him.&nbsp; But the Lord Secretary would not admit them to a

<P>conference about this matter, nor would admit them to his

<P>royal place of abode, nor come out to them to show them his

<P>face or intelligence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now was it a day gloomy and dark, a day of clouds and of

<P>thick darkness with Mansoul.&nbsp; Now they saw that they had been

<P>foolish, and began to perceive what the company and prattle

<P>of Mr. Carnal-Security had done, and what desperate damage

<P>his swaggering words had brought poor Mansoul into.&nbsp; But what

<P>further it was likely to cost them they were ignorant of.

<P>Now Mr. Godly-Fear began again to be in repute with the men

<P>of the town; yea, they were ready to look upon him as a

<P>prophet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when the Sabbath day was come, they went to hear their

<P>subordinate preacher; but oh, how he did thunder and lighten

<P>this day!&nbsp; His text was that in the prophet Jonah: 'They that

<P>observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.'&nbsp; But there

<P>was then such power and authority in that sermon, and such a

<P>dejection seen in the countenances of the people that day,

<P>that the like hath seldom been heard or seen.&nbsp; The people,

<P>when sermon was done, were scarce able to go to their homes,

<P>or to betake themselves to their employs the week after; they

<P>were so sermon-smitten, and also so sermon-sick by being

<P>smitten, that they knew not what to do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not only show to Mansoul their sin, but did tremble

<P>before them, under the sense of his own, still crying out of

<P>himself, as he preached to them, 'Unhappy man that I am! that

<P>I should do so wicked a thing!&nbsp; That I, a preacher! whom the

<P>Prince did set up to teach to Mansoul his law, should myself

<P>live senseless and sottishly here, and be one of the first

<P>found in transgression!&nbsp; This transgression also fell within

<P>my precincts; I should have cried out against the wickedness;

<P>but I let Mansoul lie wallowing in it, until it had driven

<P>Emmanuel from its borders!'&nbsp; With these things he also

<P>charged all the lords and gentry of Mansoul, to the almost

<P>distracting of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>About this time, also, there was a great sickness in the town

<P>of Mansoul, and most of the inhabitants were greatly

<P>afflicted.&nbsp; Yea, the captains also, and men of war, were

<P>brought thereby to a languishing condition, and that for a

<P>long time together; so that in case of an invasion, nothing

<P>could to purpose now have been done, either by the townsmen

<P>or field officers.&nbsp; Oh, how many pale faces, weak hands,

<P>feeble knees, and staggering men were now seen to walk the

<P>streets of Mansoul!&nbsp; Here were groans, there pants, and

<P>yonder lay those that were ready to faint.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The garments, too, which Emmanuel had given them were but in

<P>a sorry case; some were rent, some were torn, and all in a

<P>nasty condition; some also did hang so loosely upon them,

<P>that the next bush they came at was ready to pluck them off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After some time spent in this sad and desolate condition, the

<P>subordinate preacher called for a day of fasting, and to

<P>humble themselves for being so wicked against the great

<P>Shaddai and his Son.&nbsp; And he desired that Captain Boanerges

<P>would preach.&nbsp; So he consented to do it; and the day being

<P>come, and his text was this, 'Cut it down, why cumbereth it

<P>the ground?'&nbsp; And a very smart sermon he made upon the place.

<P>First, he showed what was the occasion of the words, namely,

<P>because the fig-tree was barren; then he showed what was

<P>contained in the sentence, namely, repentance, or utter

<P>desolation.&nbsp; He then showed, also, by whose authority this

<P>sentence was pronounced, and that was by Shaddai himself.

<P>And, lastly, he showed the reasons of the point, and then

<P>concluded his sermon.&nbsp; But he was very pertinent in the

<P>application, insomuch that he made poor Mansoul tremble.&nbsp; For

<P>this sermon, as well as the former, wrought much upon the

<P>hearts of the men of Mansoul; yea, it greatly helped to keep

<P>awake those that were roused by the preaching that went

<P>before.&nbsp; So that now throughout the whole town, there was

<P>little or nothing to be heard or seen but sorrow, and

<P>mourning, and woe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, after sermon, they got together and consulted what was

<P>best to be done.&nbsp; 'But,' said the subordinate preacher, 'I

<P>will do nothing of mine own head, without advising with my

<P>neighbour Mr. Godly-Fear.&nbsp; For if he had aforehand understood

<P>more of the mind of our Prince than we, I do not know but he

<P>also may have it now, even now we are turning again to

<P>virtue.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they called and sent for Mr. Godly-Fear, and he forthwith

<P>appeared.&nbsp; Then they desired that he would further show his

<P>opinion about what they had best to do. Then said the old

<P>gentleman as followeth: 'It is my opinion that this town of

<P>Mansoul should, in this day of her distress, draw up and send

<P>an humble petition to their offended Prince Emmanuel, that

<P>he, in his favour and grace, will turn again unto you, and

<P>not keep anger for ever.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the townsmen had heard this speech, they did, with one

<P>consent, agree to his advice; so they did presently draw up

<P>their request, and the next was, But who shall carry it?&nbsp; At

<P>last they did all agree to send it by my Lord Mayor.&nbsp; So he

<P>accepted of the service, and addressed himself to his

<P>journey; and went and came to the court of Shaddai, whither

<P>Emmanuel the Prince of Mansoul was gone.&nbsp; But the gate was

<P>shut, and a strict watch kept thereat; so that the petitioner

<P>was forced to stand without for a great while together.&nbsp; Then

<P>he desired that some would go into the Prince and tell him

<P>who stood at the gate, and what his business was.&nbsp; So one

<P>went and told to Shaddai, and to Emmanuel his Son, that the

<P>Lord Mayor of the town of Mansoul stood without at the gate

<P>of the King's court, desiring to be admitted into the

<P>presence of the Prince, the King's Son.&nbsp; He also told what

<P>was the Lord Mayor's errand, both to the King and his Son

<P>Emmanuel.&nbsp; But the Prince would not come down, nor admit that

<P>the gate should be opened to him, but sent him an answer to

<P>this effect: 'They have turned their back unto me, and not

<P>their face; but now in the time of their trouble they say to

<P>me, Arise, and save us.&nbsp; But can they not now go to Mr.

<P>Carnal-Security, to whom they went when they turned from me,

<P>and make him their leader, their lord, and their protection

<P>now in their trouble; why now in their trouble do they visit

<P>me, since in their prosperity they went astray?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The answer made my Lord Mayor look black in the face; it

<P>troubled, it perplexed, it rent him sore.&nbsp; And now he began

<P>again to see what it was to be familiar with Diabolonians,

<P>such as Mr. Carnal-Security was.&nbsp; When he saw that at court,

<P>as yet, there was little help to be expected, either for

<P>himself or friends in Mansoul, he smote upon his breast, and

<P>returned weeping, and all the way bewailing the lamentable

<P>state of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when he was come within sight of the town, the elders

<P>and chief of the people of Mansoul went out at the gate to

<P>meet him, and to salute him, and to know how he sped at

<P>court.&nbsp; But he told them his tale in so doleful a manner,

<P>that they all cried out, and mourned, and wept.&nbsp; Wherefore

<P>they threw ashes and dust upon their heads, and put sackcloth

<P>upon their loins, and went crying out through the town of

<P>Mansoul; the which, when the rest of the townsfolk saw, they

<P>all mourned and wept.&nbsp; This, therefore, was a day of rebuke

<P>and trouble, and of anguish to the town of Mansoul, and also

<P>of great distress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After some time, when they had somewhat refrained themselves,

<P>they came together to consult again what by them was yet to

<P>be done; and they asked advice, as they did before, of that

<P>reverend Mr. Godly-Fear, who told them that there was no way

<P>better than to do as they had done, nor would he that they

<P>should be discouraged at all with that they had met with at

<P>court; yea, though several of their petitions should be

<P>answered with nought but silence or rebuke: 'For,' said he,

<P>'it is the way of the wise Shaddai to make men wait and to

<P>exercise patience, and it should be the way of them in want,

<P>to be willing to stay his leisure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they took courage, and sent again and again, and again,

<P>and again; for there was not now one day, nor an hour that

<P>went over Mansoul's head, wherein a man might not have met

<P>upon the road one or other riding post, sounding the horn

<P>from Mansoul to the court of the King Shaddai; and all with

<P>letters petitionary in behalf of, and for the Prince's return

<P>to Mansoul.&nbsp; The road, I say, was now full of messengers,

<P>going and returning, and meeting one another; some from the

<P>court, and some from Mansoul; and this was the work of the

<P>miserable town of Mansoul, all that long, that sharp, that

<P>cold and tedious winter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now if you have not forgot, you may yet remember that I told

<P>you before, that after Emmanuel had taken Mansoul, yea, and

<P>after that he had new modelled the town, there remained in

<P>several lurking places of the corporation many of the old

<P>Diabolonians, that either came with the tyrant when he

<P>invaded and took the town, or that had there, by reason of

<P>unlawful mixtures, their birth and breeding, and bringing up.

<P>And their holes, dens, and lurking places were in, under, or

<P>about the wall of the town.&nbsp; Some of their names are the Lord

<P>Fornication, the Lord Adultery, the Lord Murder, the Lord

<P>Anger, the Lord Lasciviousness, the Lord Deceit, the Lord

<P>Evil-eye, the Lord Blasphemy, and that horrible villain, the

<P>old and dangerous Lord Covetousness.&nbsp; These, as I told you,

<P>with many more, had yet their abode in the town of Mansoul,

<P>and that after that Emmanuel had driven their prince Diabolus

<P>out of the castle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Against these the good Prince did grant a commission to the

<P>Lord Willbewill and others, yea, to the whole town of

<P>Mansoul, to seek, take, secure, and destroy any or all that

<P>they could lay hands of, for that they were Diabolonians by

<P>nature, enemies to the Prince, and those that sought to ruin

<P>the blessed town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But the town of Mansoul did not

<P>pursue this warrant, but neglected to look after, to

<P>apprehend, to secure, and to destroy these Diabolonians.

<P>Wherefore what do these villains but by degrees take courage

<P>to put forth their heads, and to show themselves to the

<P>inhabitants of the town.&nbsp; Yea, and as I was told, some of the

<P>men of Mansoul grew too familiar with some of them, to the

<P>sorrow of the corporation, as you yet will hear more of in

<P>time and place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when the Diabolonian lords that were left perceived

<P>that Mansoul had, through sinning, offended Emmanuel their

<P>Prince, and that he had withdrawn himself and was gone, what

<P>do they but plot the ruin of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; So upon a

<P>time they met together at the hold of one Mr. Mischief, who

<P>was also a Diabolonian, and there consulted how they might

<P>deliver up Mansoul into the hands of Diabolus again.&nbsp; Now

<P>some advised one way, and some another, every man according

<P>to his own liking.&nbsp; At last my Lord Lasciviousness

<P>propounded, whether it might not be best, in the first place,

<P>for some of those that were Diabolonians in Mansoul, to

<P>adventure to offer themselves for servants to some of the

<P>natives of the town; 'for,' said he, 'if they so do, and

<P>Mansoul shall accept of them, they may for us, and for

<P>Diabolus our Lord, make the taking of the town of Mansoul

<P>more easy than otherwise it will be.'&nbsp; But then stood up the

<P>Lord Murder, and said, 'This may not be done at this time;

<P>for Mansoul is now in a kind of a rage, because by our

<P>friend, Mr. Carnal-Security, she hath been once ensnared

<P>already, and made to offend against her Prince; and how shall

<P>she reconcile herself unto her lord again, but by the heads

<P>of these men?&nbsp; Besides, we know that they have in commission

<P>to take and slay us wherever they shall find us; let us,

<P>therefore, be wise as foxes: when we are dead, we can do them

<P>no hurt; but while we live, we may.'&nbsp; Thus, when they had

<P>tossed the matter to and fro, they jointly agreed that a

<P>letter should forthwith be sent away to Diabolus in their

<P>name, by which the state of the town of Mansoul should be

<P>showed him, and how much it is under the frowns of their

<P>Prince.&nbsp; 'We may also,' said some, 'let him know our

<P>intentions, and ask of him his advice in the case.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So a letter was presently framed, the contents of which were

<P>these:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To our great lord, the Prince Diabolus, dwelling below in

<P>the infernal cave:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O great father, and mighty Prince Diabolus, we, the true

<P>Diabolonians yet remaining in the rebellious town of Mansoul,

<P>having received our beings from thee, and our nourishment at

<P>thy hands, cannot with content and quiet endure to behold, as

<P>we do this day, how thou art dispraised, disgraced, and

<P>reproached among the inhabitants of this town; nor is thy

<P>long absence at all delightful to us, because greatly to our

<P>detriment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The reason of this our writing unto our lord, is for that we

<P>are not altogether without hope that this town may become thy

<P>habitation again; for it is greatly declined from its Prince

<P>Emmanuel; and he is uprisen, and is departed from them: yea,

<P>and though they send, and send, and send, and send after him

<P>to return to them, yet can they not prevail, nor get good

<P>words from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'There has been also of late, and is yet remaining, a very

<P>great sickness and fainting among them; and that not only

<P>upon the poorer sort of the town, but upon the lords,

<P>captains, and chief gentry of the place, (we only who are of

<P>the Diabolonians by nature remain well, lively, and strong,)

<P>so that through their great transgression on the one hand,

<P>and their dangerous sickness on the other, we judge they lie

<P>open to thy hand and power.&nbsp; If, therefore, it shall stand

<P>with thy horrible cunning, and with the cunning of the rest

<P>of the princes with thee, to come and make an attempt to take

<P>Mansoul again, send us word, and we shall to our utmost power

<P>be ready to deliver it into thy hand.&nbsp; Or if what we have

<P>said shall not by thy fatherhood be thought best and most

<P>meet to be done, send us thy mind in a few words, and we are

<P>all ready to follow thy counsel to the hazarding of our

<P>lives, and what else we have.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Given under our hands the day and date above-written, after

<P>a close consultation at the house of Mr. Mischief, who yet is

<P>alive and hath his place in our desirable town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Mr. Profane (for he was the carrier) was come with his

<P>letter to Hell-Gate Hill, he knocked at the brazen gates for

<P>entrance.&nbsp; Then did Cerberus, the porter, for he is the

<P>keeper of that gate, open to Mr. Profane, to whom he

<P>delivered his letter, which he had brought from the

<P>Diabolonians in Mansoul.&nbsp; So he carried it in, and presented

<P>it to Diabolus his lord, and said, 'Tidings, my lord, from

<P>Mansoul, from our trusty friends in Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then came together from all places of the den Beelzebub,

<P>Lucifer, Apollyon, with the rest of the rabblement there, to

<P>hear what news from Mansoul.&nbsp; So the letter was broken up and

<P>read, and Cerberus he stood by.&nbsp; When the letter was openly

<P>read, and the contents thereof spread into all the corners of

<P>the den, command was given that, without let or stop, dead-

<P>man's bell should be rung for joy.&nbsp; So the bell was rung, and

<P>the princes rejoiced that Mansoul was likely to come to ruin.

<P>Now, the clapper of the bell went, 'The town of Mansoul is

<P>coming to dwell with us: make room for the town of Mansoul.'

<P>This bell therefore they did ring, because they did hope that

<P>they should have Mansoul again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when they had performed this their horrible ceremony,

<P>they got together again to consult what answer to send to

<P>their friends in Mansoul; and some advised one thing, and

<P>some another: but at length, because the business required

<P>haste, they left the whole business to the prince Diabolus,

<P>judging him the most proper lord of the place.&nbsp; So he drew up

<P>a letter as he thought fit, in answer to what Mr. Profane had

<P>brought, and sent it to the Diabolonians that did dwell in

<P>Mansoul, by the same hand that had brought theirs to him; and

<P>these were the contents thereof:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To our offspring, the high and mighty Diabolonians that yet

<P>dwell in the town of Mansoul, Diabolus, the great prince of

<P>Mansoul, wisheth a prosperous issue and conclusion of those

<P>many brave enterprises, conspiracies, and designs, that you,

<P>of your love and respect to our honour, have in your hearts

<P>to attempt to do against Mansoul.&nbsp; Beloved children and

<P>disciples, my Lord Fornication, Adultery, and the rest, we

<P>have here, in our desolate den, received, to our highest joy

<P>and content, your welcome letter, by the hand of our trusty

<P>Mr. Profane; and to show how acceptable your tidings were, we

<P>rang out our bell for gladness; for we rejoiced as much as we

<P>could, when we perceived that yet we had friends in Mansoul,

<P>and such as sought our honour and revenge in the ruin of the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; We also rejoiced to hear that they are in a

<P>degenerated condition, and that they have offended their

<P>Prince, and that he is gone.&nbsp; Their sickness also pleaseth

<P>us, as does also your health, might, and strength.&nbsp; Glad also

<P>would we be, right horribly beloved, could we get this town

<P>into our clutches again.&nbsp; Nor will we be sparing of spending

<P>our wit, our cunning, our craft, and hellish inventions to

<P>bring to a wished conclusion this your brave beginning in

<P>order thereto.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And take this for your comfort, (our birth, and our

<P>offspring,) that shall we again surprise it and take it, we

<P>will attempt to put all your foes to the sword, and will make

<P>you the great lords and captains of the place.&nbsp; Nor need you

<P>fear, if ever we get it again, that we after that shall be

<P>cast out any more; for we will come with more strength, and

<P>so lay far more fast hold than at the first we did.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>it is the law of that Prince that now they own, that if we

<P>get them a second time, they shall be ours for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Do you, therefore, our trusty Diabolonians, yet more pry

<P>into, and endeavour to spy out the weakness of the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; We also would that you yourselves do attempt to

<P>weaken them more and more.&nbsp; Send us word also by what means

<P>you think we had best to attempt the regaining thereof:

<P>namely, whether by persuasion to a vain and loose life; or,

<P>whether by tempting them to doubt and despair; or, whether by

<P>blowing up of the town by the gunpowder of pride, and self-

<P>conceit.&nbsp; Do you also, O ye brave Diabolonians, and true sons

<P>of the pit, be always in a readiness to make a most hideous

<P>assault within, when we shall be ready to storm it without.

<P>Now speed you in your project, and we in our desires, to the

<P>utmost power of our gates, which is the wish of your great

<P>Diabolus, Mansoul's enemy, and him that trembles when he

<P>thinks of judgment to come.&nbsp; All the blessings of the pit be

<P>upon you, and so we close up our letter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Given at the pit's mouth, by the joint consent of all the

<P>princes of darkness, to be sent, to the force and power that

<P>we have yet remaining in Mansoul, by the hand of Mr. Profane,

<P>by me, Diabolus.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This letter, as was said, was sent to Mansoul, to the

<P>Diabolonians that yet remained there, and that yet inhabited

<P>the wall, from the dark dungeon of Diabolus, by the hand of

<P>Mr. Profane, by whom they also in Mansoul sent theirs to the

<P>pit.&nbsp; Now, when this Mr. Profane had made his return, and was

<P>come to Mansoul again, he went and came as he was wont to the

<P>house of Mr. Mischief, for there was the conclave, and the

<P>place where the contrivers were met.&nbsp; Now, when they saw that

<P>their messenger was returned safe and sound, they were

<P>greatly gladded thereat.&nbsp; Then he presented them with his

<P>letter which he had brought from Diabolus for them; the

<P>which, when they had read and considered, did much augment

<P>their gladness.&nbsp; They asked him after the welfare of their

<P>friends, as how their Lord Diabolus, Lucifer, and Beelzebub

<P>did, with the rest of those of the den.&nbsp; To which this

<P>Profane made answer, 'Well, well, my lords; they are well,

<P>even as well as can be in their place.&nbsp; They also,' said he,

<P>'did ring for joy at the reading of your letter, as you well

<P>perceived by this when you read it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, as was said, when they had read their letter, and

<P>perceived that it encouraged them in their work, they fell to

<P>their way of contriving again, namely, how they might

<P>complete their Diabolonian design upon Mansoul.&nbsp; And the

<P>first thing that they agreed upon was to keep all things from

<P>Mansoul as close as they could.&nbsp; 'Let it not be known, let

<P>not Mansoul be acquainted with what we design against it.'

<P>The next thing was, how, or by what means, they should try to

<P>bring to pass the ruin and overthrow of Mansoul; and one said

<P>after this manner, and another said after that.&nbsp; Then stood

<P>up Mr. Deceit, and said, 'My right Diabolonian friends, our

<P>lords, and the high ones of the deep dungeon, do propound

<P>unto us these three ways.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'1. Whether we had best to seek its ruin by making Mansoul

<P>loose and vain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. Or whether by driving them to doubt and despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. Or whether by endeavouring to blow them up by the

<P>gunpowder of pride and self-conceit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, I think, if we shall tempt them to pride, that may do

<P>something; and if we tempt them to wantonness, that may help.

<P>But, in my mind, if we could drive them into desperation,

<P>that would knock the nail on the head; for then we should

<P>have them, in the first place, question the truth of the love

<P>of the heart of their Prince towards them, and that will

<P>disgust him much.&nbsp; This, if it works well, will make them

<P>leave off quickly their way of sending petitions to him; then

<P>farewell earnest solicitations for help and supply; for then

<P>this conclusion lies naturally before them, "As good do

<P>nothing, as do to no purpose."'&nbsp; So to Mr. Deceit they

<P>unanimously did consent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the next question was, But how shall we do to bring this

<P>our project to pass? and it was answered by the same

<P>gentleman - that this might be the best way to do it: 'Even

<P>let,' quoth he, 'so many of our friends as are willing to

<P>venture themselves for the promoting of their prince's cause,

<P>disguise themselves with apparel, change their names, and go

<P>into the market like far country-men, and proffer to let

<P>themselves for servants to the famous town of Mansoul, and

<P>let them pretend to do for their masters as beneficially as

<P>may be; for by so doing they may, if Mansoul shall hire them,

<P>in little time so corrupt and defile the corporation, that

<P>her now Prince shall be not only further offended with them,

<P>but in conclusion shall spue them out of his mouth.&nbsp; And when

<P>this is done, our prince Diabolus shall prey upon them with

<P>ease: yea, of themselves they shall fall into the mouth of

<P>the cater.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This project was no sooner propounded, but was as highly

<P>accepted, and forward were all Diabolonians now to engage in

<P>so delicate an enterprise: but it was not thought fit that

<P>all should do thus; wherefore they pitched upon two or three,

<P>namely, the Lord Covetousness, the Lord Lasciviousness, and

<P>the Lord Anger.&nbsp; The Lord Covetousness called himself by the

<P>name of Prudent-Thrifty; the Lord Lasciviousness called

<P>himself by the name of Harmless-Mirth; and the Lord Anger

<P>called himself by the name of Good-Zeal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So upon a market-day they came into the market-place, three

<P>lusty fellows they were to look on, and they were clothed in

<P>sheep's russet, which was also now in a manner as white as

<P>were the white robes of the men of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now the men

<P>could speak the language of Mansoul well.&nbsp; So when they were

<P>come into the market-place, and had offered to let themselves

<P>to the townsmen, they were presently taken up; for they asked

<P>but little wages, and promised to do their masters great

<P>service.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Mind hired Prudent-Thrifty, and Mr. Godly-Fear hired

<P>Good-Zeal.&nbsp; True, this fellow Harmless-Mirth did hang a

<P>little in hand, and could not so soon get him a master as the

<P>others did, because the town of Mansoul was now in Lent, but

<P>after a while, because Lent was almost out, the Lord

<P>Willbewill hired Harmless-Mirth to be both his waiting man

<P>and his lackey: and thus they got them masters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;These villains now being got thus far into the houses of the

<P>men of Mansoul, quickly began to do great mischief therein;

<P>for, being filthy, arch, and sly, they quickly corrupted the

<P>families where they were; yea, they tainted their masters

<P>much, especially this Prudent-Thrifty, and him they call

<P>Harmless-Mirth.&nbsp; True, he that went under the visor of Good-

<P>Zeal, was not so well liked of his master; for he quickly

<P>found that he was but a counterfeit rascal; the which when

<P>the fellow perceived, with speed he made his escape from the

<P>house, or I doubt not but his master had hanged him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when these vagabonds had thus far carried on their

<P>design, and had corrupted the town as much as they could, in

<P>the next place they considered with themselves at what time

<P>their prince Diabolus without, and themselves within the

<P>town, should make an attempt to seize upon Mansoul; and they

<P>all agreed upon this, that a market-day would be best for

<P>that work; for why?&nbsp; Then will the townsfolk be busy in their

<P>ways: and always take this for a rule, when people are most

<P>busy in the world, they least fear a surprise.&nbsp; 'We also

<P>then,' said they, 'shall be able with less suspicion to

<P>gather ourselves together for the work of our friends and

<P>lords; yea, and in such a day, if we shall attempt our work,

<P>and miss it, we may, when they shall give us the rout, the

<P>better hide ourselves in the crowd, and escape.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These things being thus far agreed upon by them, they wrote

<P>another letter to Diabolus, and sent it by the hand to Mr.

<P>Profane, the contents of which were these:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'The lords of Looseness send to the great and high Diabolus

<P>from our dens, caves, holes, and strongholds, in and about

<P>the wall of the town of Mansoul, greeting:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Our great lord, and the nourisher of our lives, Diabolus -

<P>how glad we were when we heard of your fatherhood's readiness

<P>to comply with us, and help forward our design in our

<P>attempts to ruin Mansoul, none can tell but those who, as we

<P>do, set themselves against all appearance of good, when and

<P>wheresoever we find it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Touching the encouragement that your greatness is pleased to

<P>give us to continue to devise, contrive, and study the utter

<P>desolation of Mansoul, that we are not solicitous about: for

<P>we know right well that it cannot but be pleasing and

<P>profitable to us to see our enemies, and them that seek our

<P>lives, die at our feet, or fly before us.&nbsp; We therefore are

<P>still contriving, and that to the best of our cunning, to

<P>make this work most facile and easy to your lordships, and to

<P>us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First, we considered of that most hellishly cunning,

<P>compacted, threefold project, that by you was propounded to

<P>us in your last; and have concluded, that though to blow them

<P>up with the gunpowder of pride would do well, and to do it by

<P>tempting them to be loose and vain will help on, yet to

<P>contrive to bring them into the gulf of desperation, we think

<P>will do best of all.&nbsp; Now we, who are at your beck, have

<P>thought or two ways to do this: first we, for our parts, will

<P>make them as vile as we can, and then you with us, at a time

<P>appointed, shall be ready to fall upon them with the utmost

<P>force.&nbsp; And of all the nations that are at your whistle, we

<P>think that an army of doubters may be the most likely to

<P>attack and overcome the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thus shall we

<P>overcome these enemies, else the pit shall open her mouth

<P>upon them, and desperation shall thrust them down into it.

<P>We have also, to effect this so much by us desired design,

<P>sent already three of our trusty Diabolonians among them;

<P>they are disguised in garb, they have changed their names,

<P>and are now accepted of them; namely, Covetousness,

<P>Lasciviousness, and Anger.&nbsp; The name of Covetousness is

<P>changed to Prudent-Thrifty, and him Mr. Mind has hired, and

<P>is almost become as bad as our friend.&nbsp; Lasciviousness has

<P>changed his name to Harmless-Mirth, and he is got to be the

<P>Lord Willbewill's lackey; but he has made his master very

<P>wanton.&nbsp; Anger changed his name into Good-Zeal, and was

<P>entertained by Mr. Godly-Fear; but the peevish old gentleman

<P>took pepper in the nose, and turned our companion out of his

<P>house.&nbsp; Nay, he has informed us since that he ran away from

<P>him, or else his old master had hanged him up for his labour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now these have much helped forward our work and design upon

<P>Mansoul; for notwithstanding the spite and quarrelsome temper

<P>of the old gentleman last mentioned, the other two ply their

<P>business well, and are likely to ripen the work apace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Our next project is, that it be concluded that you come upon

<P>the town upon a market-day, and that when they are upon the

<P>heat of their business; for then, to be sure, they will be

<P>most secure, and least think that an assault will be made

<P>upon them.&nbsp; They will also at such a time be less able to

<P>defend themselves, and to offend you in the prosecution of

<P>our design.&nbsp; And we your trusty (and we are sure your

<P>beloved) ones shall, when you shall make your furious assault

<P>without, be ready to second the business within.&nbsp; So shall

<P>we, in all likelihood, be able to put Mansoul to utter

<P>confusion, and to swallow them up before they can come to

<P>themselves.&nbsp; If your serpentine heads, most subtile dragons,

<P>and our highly esteemed lords can find out a better way than

<P>this, let us quickly know your minds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'To the monsters of the infernal cave, from the house of Mr.

<P>Mischief in Mansoul, by the hand of Mr. Profane.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now all the while that the raging runagates and hellish

<P>Diabolonians were thus contriving the ruin of the town of

<P>Mansoul, they (namely, the poor town itself) was in a sad and

<P>woeful case; partly because they had so grievously offended

<P>Shaddai and his Son, and partly because that the enemies

<P>thereby got strength within them afresh; and also because,

<P>though they had by many petitions made suit to the Prince

<P>Emmanuel, and to his Father Shaddai by him, for their pardon

<P>and favour, yet hitherto obtained they not one smile; but

<P>contrariwise, through the craft and subtilty of the domestic

<P>Diabolonians, their cloud was made to grow blacker and

<P>blacker, and their Emmanuel to stand at further distance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sickness also did still greatly rage in Mansoul, both

<P>among the captains and the inhabitants of the town; and their

<P>enemies only were now lively and strong, and likely to become

<P>the head, whilst Mansoul was made the tail.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By this time the letter last mentioned, that was written by

<P>the Diabolonians that yet lurked in the town of Mansoul, was

<P>conveyed to Diabolus in the black den, by the hand of Mr.

<P>Profane.&nbsp; He carried the letter by Hell-Gate Hill as afore,

<P>and conveyed it by Cerberus to his lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when Cerberus and Mr. Profane did meet, they were

<P>presently as great as beggars, and thus they fell into

<P>discourse about Mansoul, and about the project against her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Ah! old friend,' quoth Cerberus, 'art thou come to Hell-Gate

<P>Hill again?&nbsp; By St. Mary, I am glad to see thee!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; Yes, my lord, I am come again about the concerns of

<P>the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CERB.&nbsp; Prithee, tell me what condition is that town of

<P>Mansoul in at present?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; In a brave condition, my lord, for us, and for my

<P>lords, the lords of this place, I trow for they are greatly

<P>decayed as to godliness, and that is as well as our heart can

<P>wish; their Lord is greatly out with them, and that doth also

<P>please us well.&nbsp; We have already also a foot in their dish,

<P>for our Diabolonian friends are laid in their bosoms, and

<P>what do we lack but to be masters of the place!&nbsp; Besides, our

<P>trusty friends in Mansoul are daily plotting to betray it to

<P>the lords of this town; also the sickness rages bitterly

<P>among them; and that which makes up all, we hope at last to

<P>prevail.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the dog of Hell-Gate, 'No time like this to assault

<P>them.&nbsp; I wish that the enterprise be followed close, and that

<P>the success desired may be soon effected: yea, I wish it for

<P>the poor Diabolonians' sakes, that live in the continual fear

<P>of their lives in that traitorous town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; The contrivance is almost finished, the lords in

<P>Mansoul that are Diabolonians are at it day and night, and

<P>the other are like silly doves; they want heart to be

<P>concerned with their state and to consider that ruin is at

<P>hand.&nbsp; Besides you may, yea, must think, when you put all

<P>things together, that there are many reasons that prevail

<P>with Diabolus to make what haste he can.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CERB.&nbsp; Thou hast said as it is; I am glad things are at this

<P>pass.&nbsp; Go in, my brave Profane, to my lords, they will give

<P>thee for thy welcome as good a CORANTO as the whole of this

<P>kingdom will afford.&nbsp; I have sent thy letter in already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Mr. Profane went into the den, and his lord Diabolus met

<P>him, and saluted him with, 'Welcome, my trusty servant: I

<P>have been made glad with thy letter.'&nbsp; The rest of the lords

<P>of the pit gave him also their salutations.&nbsp; Then Profane,

<P>after obeisance made to them all, said, 'Let Mansoul be given

<P>to my lord Diabolus, and let him be her king for ever.'&nbsp; And

<P>with that, the hollow belly and yawning gorge of hell gave so

<P>loud and hideous a groan, (for that is the music of that

<P>place,) that it made the mountains about it totter, as if

<P>they would fall in pieces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, after they had read and considered the letter, they

<P>consulted what answer to return; and the first that did speak

<P>to it was Lucifer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said he, 'The first project of the Diabolonians in

<P>Mansoul is likely to be lucky, and to take; namely, that they

<P>will, by all the ways and means they can, make Mansoul yet

<P>more vile and filthy: no way to destroy a soul like this.

<P>Our old friend Balaam went this way and prospered many years

<P>ago; let this therefore stand with us for a maxim, and be to

<P>Diabolonians for a general rule in all ages; for nothing can

<P>make this to fail but grace, in which I would hope that this

<P>town has no share.&nbsp; But whether to fall upon them on a

<P>market-day, because of their cumber in business, that I would

<P>should be under debate.&nbsp; And there is more reason why this

<P>head should be debated, than why some other should; because

<P>upon this will turn the whole of what we shall attempt.&nbsp; If

<P>we time not our business well, our whole project may fail.

<P>Our friends, the Diabolonians, say that a market-day is best;

<P>for then will Mansoul be most busy, and have fewest thoughts

<P>of a surprise.&nbsp; But what if also they should double their

<P>guards on those days? (and methinks nature and reason should

<P>teach them to do it;) and what if they should keep such a

<P>watch on those days as the necessity of their present case

<P>doth require? yea, what if their men should be always in arms

<P>on those days? then you may, my lords, be disappointed in

<P>your attempts, and may bring our friends in the town to utter

<P>danger of unavoidable ruin.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the great Beelzebub, 'There is something in what my

<P>lord hath said; but his conjecture may, or may not fall out.

<P>Nor hath my lord laid it down as that which must not be

<P>receded from; for I know that he said it only to provoke to a

<P>warm debate thereabout.&nbsp; Therefore we must understand, if we

<P>can, whether the town of Mansoul has such sense and knowledge

<P>of her decayed state, and of the design that we have on foot

<P>against her, as doth provoke her to set watch and ward at her

<P>gates, and to double them on market-days.&nbsp; But if, after

<P>inquiry made, it shall be found that they are asleep, then

<P>any day will do, but a market-day is best; and this is my

<P>judgment in this case.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then quoth Diabolus, 'How should we know this?' and it was

<P>answered, 'Inquire about it at the mouth of Mr. Profane.'&nbsp; So

<P>Profane was called in, and asked the question, and he made

<P>his answer as follows:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PROF.&nbsp; My lords, so far as I can gather, this is at present

<P>the condition of the town of Mansoul: they are decayed in

<P>their faith and love; Emmanuel, their Prince, has given them

<P>the back; they send often by petition to fetch him again, but

<P>he maketh not haste to answer their request, nor is there

<P>much reformation among them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>DIAB.&nbsp; I am glad that they are backward in a reformation, but

<P>yet I am afraid of their petitioning.&nbsp; However, their

<P>looseness of life is a sign that there is not much heart in

<P>what they do, and without the heart things are little worth.

<P>But go on, my masters; I will divert you, my lords, no

<P>longer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BEEL.&nbsp; If the case be so with Mansoul, as Mr. Profane has

<P>described it to be, it will be no great matter what day we

<P>assault it; not their prayers, nor their power will do them

<P>much service.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Beelzebub had ended his oration, then Apollyon did

<P>begin.&nbsp; 'My opinion,' said he, 'concerning this matter, is,

<P>that we go on fair and softly, not doing things in a hurry.

<P>Let our friends in Mansoul go on still to pollute and defile

<P>it, by seeking to draw it yet more into sin (for there is

<P>nothing like sin to devour Mansoul).&nbsp; If this be done, and it

<P>takes effect, Mansoul, of itself, will leave off to watch, to

<P>petition, or anything else that should tend to her security

<P>and safety; for she will forget her Emmanuel, she will not

<P>desire his company, and can she be gotten thus to live, her

<P>Prince will not come to her in haste.&nbsp; Our trusty friend, Mr.

<P>Carnal-Security, with one of his tricks did drive him out of

<P>the town; and why may not my Lord Covetousness, and my Lord

<P>Lasciviousness, by what they may do, keep him out of the

<P>town?&nbsp; And this I will tell you, (not because you know it

<P>not,) that two or three Diabolonians, if entertained and

<P>countenanced by the town of Mansoul, will do more to the

<P>keeping of Emmanuel from them, and towards making the town of

<P>Mansoul your own, than can an army of a legion that should be

<P>sent out from us to withstand him.&nbsp; Let, therefore, this

<P>first project that our friends in Mansoul have set on foot,

<P>be strongly and diligently carried on, with all cunning and

<P>craft imaginable; and let them send continually, under one

<P>guise or another, more and other of their men to play with

<P>the people of Mansoul; and then, perhaps, we shall not need

<P>to be at the charge of making a war upon them; or if that

<P>must of necessity be done, yet the more sinful they are, the

<P>more unable, to be sure, they will be to resist us, and then

<P>the more easily we shall overcome them.&nbsp; And besides, suppose

<P>(and that is the worst that can be supposed) that Emmanuel

<P>should come to them again, why may not the same means, or the

<P>like, drive him from them once more?&nbsp; Yea, why may he not, by

<P>their lapse into that sin again, be driven from them for

<P>ever, for the sake of which he was at the first driven from

<P>them for a season?&nbsp; And if this should happen, then away go

<P>with him his rams, his slings, his captains, his soldiers,

<P>and he leaveth Mansoul naked and bare.&nbsp; Yea, will not this

<P>town, when she sees herself utterly forsaken of her Prince,

<P>of her own accord open her gates again unto you, and make of

<P>you as in the days of old?&nbsp; But this must be done by time, a

<P>few days will not effect so great a work as this.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So soon as Apollyon had made an end of speaking, Diabolus

<P>began to blow out his own malice, and to plead his own cause;

<P>and he said, 'My lords, and powers of the cave, my true and

<P>trusty friends, I have with much impatience, as becomes me,

<P>given ear to your long and tedious orations.&nbsp; But my furious

<P>gorge, and empty paunch, so lusteth after a repossession of

<P>my famous town of Mansoul, that whatever comes out, I can

<P>wait no longer to see the events of lingering projects.&nbsp; I

<P>must, and that without further delay, seek, by all means I

<P>can, to fill my insatiable gulf with the soul and body of the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Therefore lend me your heads, your hearts,

<P>and your help, now I am going to recover my town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the lords and princes of the pit saw the flaming desire

<P>that was in Diabolus to devour the miserable town of Mansoul,

<P>they left off to raise any more objections, but consented to

<P>lend him what strength they could, though had Apollyon's

<P>advice been taken, they had far more fearfully distressed the

<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But, I say, they were willing to lend him

<P>what strength they could, not knowing what need they might

<P>have of him, when they should engage for themselves, as he.

<P>Wherefore they fell to advising about the next thing

<P>propounded, namely, what soldiers they were, and also how

<P>many, with whom Diabolus should go against the town of

<P>Mansoul to take it; and after some debate, it was concluded,

<P>according as in the letter the Diabolonians had suggested,

<P>that none were more fit for that expedition than an army of

<P>terrible doubters.&nbsp; They therefore concluded to send against

<P>Mansoul an army of sturdy doubters.&nbsp; The number thought fit

<P>to be employed in that service was between twenty and thirty

<P>thousand.&nbsp; So then the result of that great council of those

<P>high and mighty lords was - That Diabolus should even now,

<P>out of hand, beat up his drum for men in the land of

<P>Doubting, which land lieth upon the confines of the place

<P>called Hell-Gate Hill, for men that might be employed by him

<P>against the miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; It was also

<P>concluded, that these lords themselves should help him in the

<P>war, and that they would to that end head and manage his men.

<P>So they drew up a letter, and sent back to the Diabolonians

<P>that lurked in Mansoul, and that waited for the back-coming

<P>of Mr. Profane, to signify to them into what method and

<P>forwardness they at present had put their design.&nbsp; The

<P>contents whereof now follow:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'From the dark and horrible dungeon of hell, Diabolus with

<P>all the society of the princes of darkness, sends to our

<P>trusty ones, in and about the walls of the town of Mansoul,

<P>now impatiently waiting for our most devilish answer to their

<P>venomous and most poisonous design against the town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Our native ones, in whom from day to day we boast, and in

<P>whose actions all the year long we do greatly delight

<P>ourselves, we received your welcome, because highly esteemed

<P>letter, at the hand of our trusty and greatly beloved, the

<P>old gentleman, Mr. Profane.&nbsp; And do give you to understand,

<P>that when we had broken it up, and had read the contents

<P>thereof, to your amazing memory be it spoken, our yawning

<P>hollow-bellied place, where we are, made so hideous and

<P>yelling a noise for joy, that the mountains that stand round

<P>about Hell-Gate Hill, had like to have been shaken to pieces

<P>at the sound thereof.
