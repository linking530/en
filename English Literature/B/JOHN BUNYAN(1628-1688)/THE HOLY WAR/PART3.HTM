<P>Upon this speech, the town of Mansoul did again harden their

<P>hearts yet more against the captains of Shaddai.&nbsp; The

<P>thoughts of his greatness did quite quash them, and the

<P>thoughts of his holiness sunk them in despair.&nbsp; Wherefore,

<P>after a short consult, they (of the Diabolonian party they

<P>were) sent back this word by the trumpeter, That, for their

<P>parts, they were resolved to stick to their king, but never

<P>to yield to Shaddai; so it was but in vain to give them any

<P>further summons, for they had rather die upon the place than

<P>yield.&nbsp; And now things seemed to be gone quite back, and

<P>Mansoul to be out of reach or call, yet the captains who knew

<P>what their Lord could do, would not yet be beat out of heart;

<P>they therefore sent them another summons, more sharp and

<P>severe than the last; but the oftener they were sent to, to

<P>reconcile to Shaddai, the further off they were.&nbsp; 'As they

<P>called them, so they went from them - yea, though they called

<P>them to the Most High.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they ceased that way to deal with them any more, and

<P>inclined to think of another way.&nbsp; The captains, therefore,

<P>did gather themselves together, to have free conference among

<P>themselves, to know what was yet to be done to gain the town,

<P>and to deliver it from the tyranny of Diabolus; and one said

<P>after this manner, and another after that.&nbsp; Then stood up the

<P>right noble the Captain Conviction, and said, 'My brethren,

<P>mine opinion is this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First, that we continually play our slings into the town,

<P>and keep it in a continual alarm, molesting them day and

<P>night.&nbsp; By thus doing, we shall stop the growth of their

<P>rampant spirit; for a lion may be tamed by continual

<P>molestation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Secondly, this done, I advise that, in the next place, we

<P>with one consent draw up a petition to our Lord Shaddai, by

<P>which, after we have showed our King the condition of Mansoul

<P>and of affairs here, and have begged his pardon for our no

<P>better success, we will earnestly implore his Majesty's help,

<P>and that he will please to send us more force and power, and

<P>some gallant and well-spoken commander to head them, that so

<P>his Majesty may not lose the benefit of these his good

<P>beginnings, but may complete his conquest upon the town of

<P>Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To this speech of the noble Captain Conviction they as one

<P>man consented, and agreed that a petition should forthwith be

<P>drawn up, and sent by a fit man away to Shaddai with speed.

<P>The contents of the petition were thus:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Most gracious and glorious King, the Lord of the best world,

<P>and the builder of the town of Mansoul, we have, dread

<P>Sovereign, at thy commandment, put our lives in jeopardy, and

<P>at thy bidding made a war upon the famous town of Mansoul.

<P>When we went up against it, we did, according to our

<P>commission, first offer conditions of peace unto it.&nbsp; But

<P>they, great King, set light by our counsel, and would none of

<P>our reproof.&nbsp; They were for shutting their gates, and for

<P>keeping us out of the town.&nbsp; They also mounted their guns,

<P>they sallied out upon us, and have done us what damage they

<P>could; but we pursued them with alarm upon alarm, requiting

<P>them with such retribution as was meet, and have done some

<P>execution upon the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Diabolus, Incredulity, and Willbewill are the great doers

<P>against us: now we are in our winter quarters, but so as that

<P>we do yet with an high hand molest and distress the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Once, as we think, had we had but one substantial friend in

<P>the town, such as would but have seconded the sound of our

<P>summons as they ought, the people might have yielded

<P>themselves; but there were none but enemies there, nor any to

<P>speak in behalf of our Lord to the town.&nbsp; Wherefore, though

<P>we have done as we could, yet Mansoul abides in a state of

<P>rebellion against thee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now, King of kings, let it please thee to pardon the

<P>unsuccessfulness of thy servants, who have been no more

<P>advantageous in so desirable a work as the conquering of

<P>Mansoul is.&nbsp; And send, Lord, as we now desire, more forces to

<P>Mansoul, that it may be subdued; and a man to head them, that

<P>the town may both love and fear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'We do not thus speak because we are willing to relinquish

<P>the wars, (for we are for laying of our bones against the

<P>place,) but that the town of Mansoul may be won for thy

<P>Majesty.&nbsp; We also pray thy Majesty, for expedition in this

<P>matter, that, after their conquest, we may be at liberty to

<P>be sent about other thy gracious designs.&nbsp; Amen.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The petition, thus drawn up, was sent away with haste to the

<P>King by the hand of that good man, Mr. Love-to-Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this petition was come to the palace of the King, who

<P>should it be delivered to but to the King's Son?&nbsp; So he took

<P>it and read it, and because the contents of it pleased him

<P>well, he mended, and also in some things added to the

<P>petition himself.&nbsp; So, after he had made such amendments and

<P>additions as he thought convenient, with his own hand, he

<P>carried it in to the King; to whom, when he had with

<P>obeisance delivered it, he put on authority, and spake to it

<P>himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now the King, at the sight of the petition, was glad; but how

<P>much more, think you, when it was seconded by his Son!&nbsp; It

<P>pleased him also to hear that his servants who camped against

<P>Mansoul were so hearty in the work, and so steadfast in their

<P>resolves, and that they had already got some ground upon the

<P>famous town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore the King called to him Emmanuel, his Son, who said,

<P>'Here am I, my Father.'&nbsp; Then said the King, 'Thou knowest,

<P>as I do myself, the condition of the town of Mansoul, and

<P>what we have purposed, and what thou hast done to redeem it.

<P>Come now, therefore, my Son, and prepare thyself for the war,

<P>for thou shalt go to my camp at Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou shalt also

<P>there prosper and prevail, and conquer the town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the King's Son, 'Thy law is within my heart: I

<P>delight to do thy will.&nbsp; This is the day that I have longed

<P>for, and the work that I have waited for all this while.

<P>Grant me, therefore, what force thou shalt in thy wisdom

<P>think meet; and I will go and will deliver from Diabolus, and

<P>from his power, thy perishing town of Mansoul.&nbsp; My heart has

<P>been often pained within me for the miserable town of

<P>Mansoul; but now it is rejoiced, but now it is glad,'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And with that he leaped over the mountains for joy, saying,

<P>'I have not, in my heart, thought anything too dear for

<P>Mansoul: the day of vengeance is in mine heart for thee, my

<P>Mansoul: and glad am I that thou, my Father, hast made me the

<P>Captain of their salvation.&nbsp; And I will now begin to plague

<P>all those that have been a plague to my town of Mansoul, and

<P>will deliver it from their hand.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the King's Son had said thus to his Father, it presently

<P>flew like lightning round about at court; yea, it there

<P>became the only talk what Emmanuel was to go to do for the

<P>famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But you cannot think how the

<P>courtiers, too, were taken with this design of the Prince;

<P>yea, so affected were they with this work, and with the

<P>justness of the war, that the highest lord and greatest peer

<P>of the kingdom did covet to have commissions under Emmanuel,

<P>to go to help to recover again to Shaddai the miserable town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then was it concluded that some should go and carry tidings

<P>to the camp, that Emmanuel was to come to recover Mansoul,

<P>and that he would bring along with him so mighty, so

<P>impregnable a force, that he could not be resisted.&nbsp; But, oh!

<P>how ready were the high ones at court to run like lackeys to

<P>carry these tidings to the camp that was at Mansoul.&nbsp; Now,

<P>when the captains perceived that the King would send Emmanuel

<P>his Son, and that it also delighted the Son to be sent on

<P>this errand by the great Shaddai his Father, they also, to

<P>show how they were pleased at the thoughts of his coming gave

<P>a shout that made the earth rend at the sound thereof.&nbsp; Yea,

<P>the mountains did answer again by echo, and Diabolus himself

<P>did totter and shake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For you must know, that though the town of Mansoul itself was

<P>not much, if at all concerned with the project, (for, alas

<P>for them! they were wofully besotted, for they chiefly

<P>regarded their pleasure and their lusts,) yet Diabolus their

<P>governor was; for he had his spies continually abroad, who

<P>brought him intelligence of all things, and they told him

<P>what was doing at court against him, and that Emmanuel would

<P>shortly certainly come with a power to invade him.&nbsp; Nor was

<P>there any man at court, nor peer of the kingdom, that

<P>Diabolus so feared as he feared this Prince; for, if you

<P>remember, I showed you before that Diabolus had felt the

<P>weight of his hand already; so that, since it was he that was

<P>to come, this made him the more afraid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, you see how I have told you that the King's Son was

<P>engaged to come from the court to save Mansoul, and that his

<P>Father had made him the Captain of the forces.&nbsp; The time,

<P>therefore, of his setting forth being now expired, he

<P>addressed himself for his march, and taketh with him, for his

<P>power, five noble captains and their forces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. The first was that famous captain, the noble Captain

<P>Credence.&nbsp; His were the red colours, and Mr. Promise bare

<P>them; and for a scutcheon he had the holy lamb and golden

<P>shield; and he had ten thousand men at his feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. The second was that famous captain, the Captain Good-Hope.

<P>His were the blue colours; his standard-bearer was Mr.

<P>Expectation, and for his scutcheon he had the three golden

<P>anchors; and he had ten thousand men at his feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. The third was that valiant captain, the Captain Charity.

<P>His standard-bearer was Mr. Pitiful: his were the green

<P>colours, and for his scutcheon he had three naked orphans

<P>embraced in the bosom; and he had ten thousand men at his

<P>feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. The fourth was that gallant commander, the Captain

<P>Innocent.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Harmless: his were the

<P>white colours, and for his scutcheon he had the three golden

<P>doves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>5. The fifth was the truly loyal and well-beloved captain,

<P>the Captain Patience.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Suffer-

<P>Long: his were the black colours, and for a scutcheon he had

<P>three arrows through the golden heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were Emmanuel's captains; these their standard-bearers,

<P>their colours, and their scutcheons; and these the men under

<P>their command.&nbsp; So, as was said, the brave Prince took his

<P>march to go to the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Captain Credence led the

<P>van, and Captain Patience brought up the rear; so the other

<P>three, with their men, made up the main body, the Prince

<P>himself riding in his chariot at the head of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when they set out for their march, oh, how the trumpets

<P>sounded, their armour glittered, and how the colours waved in

<P>the wind!&nbsp; The Prince's armour was all of gold, and it shone

<P>like the sun in the firmament; the captains' armour was of

<P>proof, and was in appearance like the glittering stars.

<P>There were also some from the court that rode reformades for

<P>the love that they had to the King Shaddai, and for the happy

<P>deliverance of the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emmanuel also, when he had thus set forwards to go to recover

<P>the town of Mansoul, took with him, at the commandment of his

<P>Father, fifty-four battering-rams, and twelve slings to whirl

<P>stones withal.&nbsp; Every one of these was made of pure gold, and

<P>these they carried with them, in the heart and body of their

<P>army, all along as they went to Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they marched till they came within less than a league of

<P>the town; there they lay till the first four captains came

<P>thither to acquaint them with matters.&nbsp; Then they took their

<P>journey to go to the town of Mansoul, and unto Mansoul they

<P>came; but when the old soldiers that were in the camp saw

<P>that they had new forces to join with, they again gave such a

<P>shout before the walls of the town of Mansoul, that it put

<P>Diabolus into another fright.&nbsp; So they sat down before the

<P>town, not now as the other four captains did, to wit, against

<P>the gates of Mansoul only; but they environed it round on

<P>every side, and beset it behind and before; so that now, let

<P>Mansoul look which way it will, it saw force and power lie in

<P>siege against it.&nbsp; Besides, there were mounts cast up against

<P>it.&nbsp; The Mount Gracious was on the one side, and Mount

<P>Justice was on the other.&nbsp; Further, there were several small

<P>banks and advance-grounds, as Plain-Truth Hill and No-Sin

<P>Banks, where many of the slings were placed against the town.

<P>Upon Mount Gracious were planted four, and upon Mount Justice

<P>were placed as many, and the rest were conveniently placed in

<P>several parts round about the town.&nbsp; Five of the best

<P>battering-rams, that is, of the biggest of them, were placed

<P>upon Mount Hearken, a mount cast up hard by Ear-gate, with

<P>intent to break that open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when the men of the town saw the multitude of the

<P>soldiers that were come up against the place, and the rams

<P>and slings, and the mounts on which they were planted,

<P>together with the glittering of the armour and the waving of

<P>their colours, they were forced to shift, and shift, and

<P>again to shift their thoughts; but they hardly changed for

<P>thoughts more stout, but rather for thoughts more faint; for

<P>though before they thought themselves sufficiently guarded,

<P>yet now they began to think that no man knew what would be

<P>their hap or lot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the good Prince Emmanuel had thus beleaguered Mansoul,

<P>in the first place he hangs out the white flag, which he

<P>caused to be set up among the golden slings that were planted

<P>upon Mount Gracious.&nbsp; And this he did for two reasons: 1. To

<P>give notice to Mansoul that he could and would yet be

<P>gracious if they turned to him.&nbsp; 2. And that he might leave

<P>them the more without excuse, should he destroy them, they

<P>continuing in their rebellion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the white flag, with the three golden doves in it, was

<P>hung out for two days together, to give them time and space

<P>to consider; but they, as was hinted before, as if they were

<P>unconcerned, made no reply to the favourable signal of the

<P>Prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he commanded, and they set the red flag upon that mount

<P>called Mount Justice.&nbsp; It was the red flag of Captain

<P>Judgment, whose scutcheon was the burning fiery furnace; and

<P>this also stood waving before them in the wind for several

<P>days together.&nbsp; But look how they carried it under the white

<P>flag, when that was hung out, so did they also when the red

<P>one was; and yet he took no advantage of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he commanded again that his servants should hang out the

<P>black flag of defiance against them, whose scutcheon was the

<P>three burning thunderbolts; but as unconcerned was Mansoul at

<P>this as at those that went before.&nbsp; But when the Prince saw

<P>that neither mercy nor judgment, nor execution of judgment,

<P>would or could come near the heart of Mansoul, he was touched

<P>with much compunction, and said, 'Surely this strange

<P>carriage of the town of Mansoul doth rather arise from

<P>ignorance of the manner and feats of war, than from a secret

<P>defiance of us, and abhorrence of their own lives; or if they

<P>know the manner of the war of their own, yet not the rites

<P>and ceremonies of the wars in which we are concerned, when I

<P>make wars upon mine enemy Diabolus.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Therefore he sent to the town of Mansoul, to let them know

<P>what he meant by those signs and ceremonies of the flag; and

<P>also to know of them which of the things they would choose,

<P>whether grace and mercy, or judgment and the execution of

<P>judgment.&nbsp; All this while they kept their gates shut with

<P>locks, bolts, and bars, as fast as they could.&nbsp; Their guards

<P>also were doubled, and their watch made as strong as they

<P>could.&nbsp; Diabolus also did pluck up what heart he could, to

<P>encourage the town to make resistance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The townsmen also made answer to the Prince's messenger, in

<P>substance according to that which follows:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Great Sir, - As to what, by your messenger, you have

<P>signified to us, whether we will accept of your mercy, or

<P>fall by your justice, we are bound by the law and custom of

<P>this place, and can give you no positive answer; for it is

<P>against the law, government, and the prerogative royal of our

<P>king, to make either peace or war without him.&nbsp; But this we

<P>will do, - we will petition that our prince will come down to

<P>the wall, and there give you such treatment as he shall think

<P>fit and profitable for us.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the good Prince Emmanuel heard this answer, and saw the

<P>slavery and bondage of the people, and how much content they

<P>were to abide in the chains of the tyrant Diabolus, it

<P>grieved him at the heart; and, indeed, when at any time he

<P>perceived that any were contented under the slavery of the

<P>giant, he would be affected with it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But to return again to our purpose.&nbsp; After the town had

<P>carried this news to Diabolus, and had told him, moreover,

<P>that the Prince, that lay in the leaguer without the wall,

<P>waited upon them for an answer, he refused, and huffed as

<P>well as he could; but in heart he was afraid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said he, 'I will go down to the gates myself, and give

<P>him such an answer as I think fit.'&nbsp; So he went down to

<P>Mouth-gate, and there addressed himself to speak to Emmanuel,

<P>(but in such language as the town understood not,) the

<P>contents whereof were as follows:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O thou great Emmanuel, Lord of all the world, I know thee,

<P>that thou art the Son of the great Shaddai!&nbsp; Wherefore art

<P>thou come to torment me, and to cast me out of my possession?

<P>This town of Mansoul, as thou very well knowest, is mine, and

<P>that by a twofold right. 1. It is mine by right of conquest;

<P>I won it in the open field; and shall the prey be taken from

<P>the mighty, or the lawful captive be delivered?&nbsp; 2. This town

<P>of Mansoul is mine also by their subjection.&nbsp; They have

<P>opened the gates of their town unto me; they have sworn

<P>fidelity to me, and have openly chosen me to be their king;

<P>they have also given their castle into my hands; yea, they

<P>have put the whole strength of Mansoul under me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Moreover, this town of Mansoul hath disavowed thee, yea,

<P>they have cast thy law, thy name, thy image, and all that is

<P>thine, behind their back, and have accepted and set up in

<P>their room my law, my name, my image, and all that ever is

<P>mine.&nbsp; Ask else thy captains, and they will tell thee that

<P>Mansoul hath, in answer to all their summonses, shown love

<P>and loyalty to me, but always disdain, despite, contempt, and

<P>scorn to thee and thine.&nbsp; Now, thou art the Just One and the

<P>Holy, and shouldest do no iniquity.&nbsp; Depart, then, I pray

<P>thee, therefore, from me, and leave me to my just inheritance

<P>peaceably.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This oration was made in the language of Diabolus himself;

<P>for although he can, to every man, speak in their own

<P>language, (else he could not tempt them all as he does,) yet

<P>he has a language proper to himself, and it is the language

<P>of the infernal cave, or black pit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore the town of Mansoul (poor hearts!) understood him

<P>not; nor did they see how he crouched and cringed while he

<P>stood before Emmanuel, their Prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yea, they all this while took him to be one of that power and

<P>force that by no means could be resisted.&nbsp; Wherefore, while

<P>he was thus entreating that he might have yet his residence

<P>there, and that Emmanuel would not take it from him by force,

<P>the inhabitants boasted even of his valour, saying, 'Who is

<P>able to make war with him?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when this pretended king had made an end of what he

<P>would say, Emmanuel, the golden Prince, stood up and spake;

<P>the contents of whose words follow:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou deceiving one,' said he, 'I have, in my Father's name,

<P>in mine own name, and on the behalf and for the good of this

<P>wretched town of Mansoul, somewhat to say unto thee.&nbsp; Thou

<P>pretendest a right, a lawful right, to the deplorable town of

<P>Mansoul, when it is most apparent to all my Father's court

<P>that the entrance which thou hast obtained in at the gates of

<P>Mansoul was through thy lie and falsehood; thou beliedst my

<P>Father, thou beliedst his law, and so deceivedst the people

<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou pretendest that the people have accepted

<P>thee for their king, their captain, and right liege lord; but

<P>that also was by the exercise of deceit and guile.&nbsp; Now, if

<P>lying, wiliness, sinful craft, and all manner of horrible

<P>hypocrisy, will go in my Father's court (in which court thou

<P>must be tried) for equity and right, then will I confess unto

<P>thee that thou hast made a lawful conquest.&nbsp; But, alas! what

<P>thief, what tyrant, what devil is there that may not conquer

<P>after this sort?&nbsp; But I can make it appear, O Diabolus, that

<P>thou, in all thy pretences to a conquest of Mansoul, hast

<P>nothing of truth to say.&nbsp; Thinkest thou this to be right,

<P>that that didst put the lie upon my Father, and madest him

<P>(to Mansoul) the greatest deluder in the world?&nbsp; And what

<P>sayest thou to thy perverting knowingly the right purport and

<P>intent of the law?&nbsp; Was it good also that thou madest a prey

<P>of the innocency and simplicity of the now miserable town of

<P>Mansoul?&nbsp; Yea, thou didst overcome Mansoul by promising to

<P>them happiness in their transgressions against my Father's

<P>law, when thou knewest, and couldest not but know, hadst thou

<P>consulted nothing but thine own experience, that that was the

<P>way to undo them.&nbsp; Thou hast also thyself, O thou master of

<P>enmity, of spite defaced my Father's image in Mansoul, and

<P>set up thy own in its place, to the great contempt of my

<P>Father, the heightening of thy sin, and to the intolerable

<P>damage of the perishing town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou hast, moreover, (as if all these were but little things

<P>with thee,) not only deluded and undone this place, but, by

<P>thy lies and fradulent carriage, hast set them against their

<P>own deliverance.&nbsp; How hast thou stirred them up against my

<P>Father's captains, and made them to fight against those that

<P>were sent of him to deliver them from their bondage!&nbsp; All

<P>these things, and very many more, thou hast done against thy

<P>light, and in contempt of my Father and of his law, yea, and

<P>with design to bring under his displeasure for ever the

<P>miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I am therefore come to avenge the

<P>wrong that thou hast done to my Father, and to deal with thee

<P>for the blasphemies wherewith thou hast made poor Mansoul

<P>blaspheme his name.&nbsp; Yea, upon thy head, thou prince of the

<P>infernal cave, will I requite it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'As for myself, O Diabolus, I am come against thee by lawful

<P>power, and to take, by strength of hand, this town of Mansoul

<P>out of thy burning fingers; for this town of Mansoul is mine,

<P>O Diabolus, and that by undoubted right, as all shall see

<P>that will diligently search the most ancient and most

<P>authentic records, and I will plead my title to it, to the

<P>confusion of thy face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First, for the town of Mansoul, my Father built and did

<P>fashion it with his hand.&nbsp; The palace also that is in the

<P>midst of that town, he built it for his own delight.&nbsp; This

<P>town of Mansoul, therefore, is my Father's, and that by the

<P>best of titles, and he that gainsays the truth of this must

<P>lie against his soul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Secondly, O thou master of the lie, this town of Mansoul is

<P>mine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'1. For that I am my Father's heir, his firstborn, and the

<P>only delight of his heart.&nbsp; I am therefore come up against

<P>thee in mine own right, even to recover mine own inheritance

<P>out of thine hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. But further, as I have a right and title to Mansoul by

<P>being my Father's heir, so I have also by my Father's

<P>donation.&nbsp; His it was, and he gave it me; nor have I at any

<P>time offended my Father, that he should take it from me, and

<P>give it to thee.&nbsp; Nor have I been forced, by playing the

<P>bankrupt, to sell or set to sale to thee my beloved town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Mansoul is my desire, my delight, and the joy of my

<P>heart.&nbsp; But,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. Mansoul is mine by right of purchase.&nbsp; I have bought it,

<P>O Diabolus, I have bought it to myself.&nbsp; Now, since it was my

<P>Father's and mine, as I was his heir, and since also I have

<P>made it mine by virtue of a great purchase, it followeth

<P>that, by all lawful right, the town of Mansoul is mine, and

<P>that thou art an usurper, a tyrant, and traitor, in thy

<P>holding possession thereof.&nbsp; Now, the cause of my purchasing

<P>of it was this: Mansoul had trespassed against my Father; now

<P>my Father had said, that in the day that they broke his law

<P>they should die.&nbsp; Now, it is more possible for heaven and

<P>earth to pass away than for my Father to break his word.

<P>Wherefore when Mansoul had sinned indeed by hearkening to thy

<P>lie, I put in and became a surety to my Father, body for

<P>body, and soul for soul, that I would make amends for

<P>Mansoul's transgressions, and my Father did accept thereof.

<P>So, when the time appointed was come, I gave body for body,

<P>soul for soul, life for life, blood for blood, and so

<P>redeemed my beloved Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'4. Nor did I do this by halves: my Father's law and justice,

<P>that were both concerned in the threatening upon

<P>transgression, are both now satisfied, and very well content

<P>that Mansoul should be delivered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'5. Nor am I come out this day against thee, but by

<P>commandment of my Father; it was he that said unto me, "Go

<P>down and deliver Mansoul."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Wherefore be it known unto thee, O thou fountain of deceit,

<P>and be it also known to the foolish town of Mansoul, that I

<P>am not come against thee this day without my Father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And now,' said the golden-headed Prince, 'I have a word to

<P>the town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; But so soon as mention was made that

<P>he had a word to speak to the besotted town of Mansoul, the

<P>gates were double-guarded, and all men commanded not to give

<P>him audience.&nbsp; So he proceeded and said, 'O unhappy town of

<P>Mansoul, I cannot but be touched with pity and compassion for

<P>thee.&nbsp; Thou hast accepted of Diabolus for thy king, and art

<P>become a nurse and minister of Diabolonians against thy

<P>sovereign Lord.&nbsp; Thy gates thou hast opened to him, but hast

<P>shut them fast against me; thou hast given him an hearing,

<P>but hast stopped thine ears at my cry.&nbsp; He brought to thee

<P>thy destruction, and thou didst receive both him and it: I am

<P>come to thee bringing salvation, but thou regardest me not.

<P>Besides, thou hast, as with sacrilegious hands, taken

<P>thyself, with all that was mine in thee, and hast given all

<P>to my foe, and to the greatest enemy my Father has.&nbsp; You have

<P>bowed and subjected yourselves to him, you have vowed and

<P>sworn yourselves to be his.&nbsp; Poor Mansoul! what shall I do

<P>unto thee?&nbsp; Shall I save thee? - shall I destroy thee?&nbsp; What

<P>shall I do unto thee?&nbsp; Shall I fall upon thee, and grind thee

<P>to powder, or make thee a monument of the richest grace?

<P>What shall I do unto thee?&nbsp; Hearken, therefore, thou town of

<P>Mansoul, hearken to my word, and thou shalt live.&nbsp; I am

<P>merciful, Mansoul, and thou shalt find me so: shut me not out

<P>of thy gates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O Mansoul, neither is my commission nor inclination at all

<P>to do thee hurt.&nbsp; Why fliest thou so fast from thy friend,

<P>and stickest so close to thine enemy?&nbsp; Indeed, I would have

<P>thee, because it becomes thee to be sorry for thy sin, but do

<P>not despair of life; this great force is not to hurt thee,

<P>but to deliver thee from thy bondage, and to reduce thee to

<P>thy obedience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'My commission, indeed, is to make a war upon Diabolus thy

<P>king, and upon all Diabolonians with him; for he is the

<P>strong man armed that keeps the house, and I will have him

<P>out: his spoils I must divide, his armour I must take from

<P>him, his hold I must cast him out of, and must make it a

<P>habitation for myself.&nbsp; And this, O Mansoul, shall Diabolus

<P>know when he shall be made to follow me in chains, and when

<P>Mansoul shall rejoice to see it so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;'I could, would I now put forth my might, cause that

<P>forthwith he should leave you and depart; but I have it in my

<P>heart so to deal with him, as that the justice of the war

<P>that I shall make upon him may be seen and acknowledged by

<P>all.&nbsp; He hath taken Mansoul by fraud, and keeps it by

<P>violence and deceit, and I will make him bare and naked in

<P>the eyes of all observers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'All my words are true.&nbsp; I am mighty to save, and will

<P>deliver my Mansoul out of his hand.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This speech was intended chiefly for Mansoul, but Mansoul

<P>would not have the hearing of it.&nbsp; They shut up Ear-gate,

<P>they barricaded it up, they kept it locked and bolted, they

<P>set a guard thereat, and commanded that no Mansoulonian

<P>should go out to him, nor that any from the camp should be

<P>admitted into the town.&nbsp; All this they did, so horribly had

<P>Diabolus enchanted them to do, and seek to do for him,

<P>against their rightful Lord and Prince; wherefore no man, nor

<P>voice, nor sound of man that belonged to the glorious host,

<P>was to come into the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when Emmanuel saw that Mansoul was thus involved in sin,

<P>he calls his army together, (since now also his words were

<P>despised,) and gave out a commandment throughout all his host

<P>to be ready against the time appointed.&nbsp; Now, forasmuch as

<P>there was no way lawfully to take the town of Mansoul but to

<P>get in by the gates, and at Ear-gate as the chief, therefore

<P>he commanded his captains and commanders to bring their rams,

<P>their slings and their men, and place them at Eye-gate and

<P>Ear-gate, in order to his taking the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Emmanuel had put all things in a readiness to give

<P>Diabolus battle, he sent again to know of the town of

<P>Mansoul, if in peaceable manner they would yield themselves,

<P>or whether they were yet resolved to put him to try the

<P>utmost extremity?&nbsp; They then, together with Diabolus their

<P>king, called a council of war, and resolved upon certain

<P>propositions that should be offered to Emmanuel, if he will

<P>accept thereof, so they agreed; and then the next was, who

<P>should be sent on this errand.&nbsp; Now, there was in the town of

<P>Mansoul an old man, a Diabolonian, and his name was Mr. Loth-

<P>to-stoop, a stiff man in his way, and a great doer for

<P>Diabolus; him, therefore, they sent, and put into his mouth

<P>what he should say.&nbsp; So he went and came to the camp to

<P>Emmanuel, and when he was come, a time was appointed to give

<P>him audience.&nbsp; So at the time he came, and after a

<P>Diabolonian ceremony or two, he thus began and said, 'Great

<P>sir, that it may be known unto all men how good-natured a

<P>prince my master is, he has sent me to tell your lordship

<P>that he is very willing, rather than go to war, to deliver up

<P>into your hands one half of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I am

<P>therefore to know if your Mightiness will accept of this

<P>proposition.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'The whole is mine by gift and purchase,

<P>wherefore I will never lose one half.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'Sir, my master hath said that

<P>he will be content that you shall be the nominal and titular

<P>Lord of all, if he may possess but a part.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Emmanuel answered, 'The whole is mine really, not in

<P>name and word only; wherefore I will be the sole lord and

<P>possessor of all, or of none at all, of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Mr. Loth-to-stoop said again, 'Sir, behold the

<P>condescension of my master!&nbsp; He says, that he will be

<P>content, if he may but have assigned to him some place in

<P>Mansoul as a place to live privately in, and you shall be

<P>Lord of all the rest.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the golden Prince, 'All that the Father giveth me

<P>shall come to me; and of all that he giveth me I will lose

<P>nothing - no, not a hoof nor a hair.&nbsp; I will not, therefore,

<P>grant him, no, not the least corner of Mansoul to dwell in; I

<P>will have all to myself.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Loth-to-stoop said again, 'But, sir, suppose that my

<P>Lord should resign the whole town to you, only with this

<P>proviso, that he sometimes, when he comes into this country,

<P>may, for old acquaintance' sake, be entertained as a

<P>wayfaring man for two days, or ten days or a month, or so.

<P>May not this small matter be granted?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'No.&nbsp; He came as a wayfaring man to

<P>David, nor did he stay long with him, and yet it had like to

<P>have cost David his soul.&nbsp; I will not consent that he ever

<P>should have any harbour more there.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'Sir, you seem to be very hard.

<P>Suppose my master should yield to all that your lordship hath

<P>said, provided that his friends and kindred in Mansoul may

<P>have liberty to trade in the town, and to enjoy their present

<P>dwellings.&nbsp; May not that be granted, sir?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'No; that is contrary to my Father's

<P>will; for all, and all manner of Diabolonians that now are,

<P>or that at any time shall be found in Mansoul, shall not only

<P>lose their lands and liberties, but also their lives.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Loth-to-stoop again, 'But, sir, may not my

<P>master and great lord, by letters, by passengers, by

<P>accidental opportunities, and the like, maintain, if he shall

<P>deliver up all unto thee, some kind of old friendship with

<P>Mansoul?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emmanuel answered, 'No, by no means; forasmuch as any such

<P>fellowship, friendship, intimacy, or acquaintance, in what

<P>way, sort, or mode soever maintained, will tend to the

<P>corrupting of Mansoul, the alienating of their affections

<P>from me, and the endangering of their peace with my Father.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Loth-to-stoop yet added further, saying, 'But, great sir,

<P>since my master hath many friends, and those that are dear to

<P>him, in Mansoul, may he not, if he shall depart from them,

<P>even of his bounty and good-nature, bestow upon them, as he

<P>sees fit, some tokens of his love and kindness that he had

<P>for them, to the end that Mansoul, when he is gone, may look

<P>upon such tokens of kindness once received from their old

<P>friend, and remember him who was once their king, and the

<P>merry times that they sometimes enjoyed one with another,

<P>while he and they lived in peace together?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'No; for if Mansoul come to be mine, I

<P>shall not admit of nor consent that there should be the least

<P>scrap, shred, or dust of Diabolus left behind, as tokens of

<P>gifts bestowed upon any in Mansoul, thereby to call to

<P>remembrance the horrible communion that was betwixt them and

<P>him.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Well, sir,' said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'I have one thing more

<P>to propound, and then I am got to the end of my commission.

<P>Suppose that, when my master is gone from Mansoul, any that

<P>shall yet live in the town should have such business of high

<P>concerns to do, that if they be neglected the party shall be

<P>undone; and suppose, sir, that nobody can help in that case

<P>so well as my master and lord, may not now my master be sent

<P>for upon so urgent an occasion as this?&nbsp; Or if he may not be

<P>admitted into the town, may not he and the person concerned

<P>meet in some of the villages near Mansoul, and there lay

<P>their heads together, and there consult of matters?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the last of those ensnaring propositions that Mr.

<P>Loth-to-stoop had to propound to Emmanuel on behalf of his

<P>master Diabolus; but Emmanuel would not grant it; for he

<P>said, 'There can be no case, or thing, or matter fall out in

<P>Mansoul, when thy master shall be gone, that may not be

<P>solved by my Father; besides, it will be a great

<P>disparagement to my Father's wisdom and skill to admit any

<P>from Mansoul to go out to Diabolus for advice, when they are

<P>bid before, in everything, by prayer and supplication to let

<P>their requests be made known to my Father.&nbsp; Further, this,

<P>should it be granted, would be to grant that a door should be

<P>set open for Diabolus, and the Diabolonians in Mansoul, to

<P>hatch, and plot, and bring to pass treasonable designs, to

<P>the grief of my Father and me, and to the utter destruction

<P>of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Mr. Loth-to-stoop had heard this answer, he took his

<P>leave of Emmanuel, and departed, saying that he would carry

<P>word to his master concerning this whole affair.&nbsp; So he

<P>departed, and came to Diabolus to Mansoul, and told him the

<P>whole of the matter, and how Emmanuel would not admit, no,

<P>not by any means, that he, when he was once gone out, should

<P>for ever have anything more to do either in, or with any that

<P>are of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; When Mansoul and Diabolus had

<P>heard this relation of things, they with one consent

<P>concluded to use their best endeavour to keep Emmanuel out of

<P>Mansoul, and sent old Ill-Pause, of whom you have heard

<P>before, to tell the Prince and his captains so.&nbsp; So the old

<P>gentleman came up to the top of Ear-gate, and called to the

<P>camp for a hearing, who when they gave audience, he said, 'I

<P>have in commandment from my high lord to bid you tell it to

<P>your Prince Emmanuel, that Mansoul and their king are

<P>resolved to stand and fall together; and that it is in vain

<P>for your Prince to think of ever having Mansoul in his hand,

<P>unless he can take it by force.'&nbsp; So some went and told to

<P>Emmanuel what old Ill-Pause, a Diabolonian in Mansoul, had

<P>said.&nbsp; Then said the Prince, 'I must try the power of my

<P>sword, for I will not (for all the rebellions and repulses

<P>that Mansoul has made against me) raise my siege and depart,

<P>but will assuredly take my Mansoul, and deliver it from the

<P>hand of her enemy.'&nbsp; And with that he gave out a commandment

<P>that Captain Boanerges, Captain Conviction, Captain Judgment,

<P>and Captain Execution should forthwith march up to Ear-gate

<P>with trumpets sounding, colours flying, and with shouting for

<P>the battle.&nbsp; Also he would that Captain Credence should join

<P>himself with them.&nbsp; Emmanuel, moreover, gave order that

<P>Captain Good-Hope and Captain Charity should draw themselves

<P>up before Eye-gate.&nbsp; He bid also that the rest of his

<P>captains and their men should place themselves for the best

<P>of their advantage against the enemy round about the town;

<P>and all was done as he had commanded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he bid that the word should be given forth, and the word

<P>was at that time, 'EMMANUEL.'&nbsp; Then was an alarm sounded, and

<P>the battering-rams were played, and the slings did whirl

<P>stones into the town amain, and thus the battle began.&nbsp; Now

<P>Diabolus himself did manage the townsmen in the war, and that

<P>at every gate; wherefore their resistance was the more

<P>forcible, hellish, and offensive to Emmanuel.&nbsp; Thus was the

<P>good Prince engaged and entertained by Diabolus and Mansoul

<P>for several days together; and a sight worth seeing it was to

<P>behold how the captains of Shaddai behaved themselves in this

<P>war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And first for Captain Boanerges, (not to under-value the

<P>rest,) he made three most fierce assaults, one after another,

<P>upon Ear-gate, to the shaking of the posts thereof.&nbsp; Captain

<P>Conviction, he also made up as fast with Boanerges as

<P>possibly he could, and both discerning that the gate began to

<P>yield, they commanded that the rams should still be played

<P>against it.&nbsp; Now, Captain Conviction, going up very near to

<P>the gate, was with great force driven back, and received

<P>three wounds in the mouth.&nbsp; And those that rode reformades,

<P>they went about to encourage the captains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the valour of the two captains, made mention of before,

<P>the Prince sent for them to his pavilion, and commanded that

<P>a while they should rest themselves, and that with somewhat

<P>they should be refreshed.&nbsp; Care also was taken for Captain

<P>Conviction, that he should be healed of his wounds.&nbsp; The

<P>Prince also gave to each of them a chain of gold, and bid

<P>them yet be of good courage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nor did Captain Good-Hope nor Captain Charity come behind in

<P>this most desperate fight, for they so well did behave

<P>themselves at Eye-gate, that they had almost broken it quite

<P>open.&nbsp; These also had a reward from their Prince, as also had

<P>the rest of the captains, because they did valiantly round

<P>about the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this engagement several of the officers of Diabolus were

<P>slain, and some of the townsmen wounded.&nbsp; For the officers,

<P>there was one Captain Boasting slain.&nbsp; This Boasting thought

<P>that nobody could have shaken the posts of Ear-gate, nor have

<P>shaken the heart of Diabolus.&nbsp; Next to him there was one

<P>Captain Secure slain: this Secure used to say that the blind

<P>and lame in Mansoul were able to keep the gates of the town

<P>against Emmanuel's army.&nbsp; This Captain Secure did Captain

<P>Conviction cleave down the head with a two-handed sword, when

<P>he received himself three wounds in his mouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Besides these there was one Captain Bragman, a very desperate

<P>fellow, and he was captain over a band of those that threw

<P>firebrands, arrows, and death: he also received, by the hand

<P>of Captain Good-Hope at Eye-gate, a mortal wound in the

<P>breast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was, moreover, one Mr. Feeling; but he was no captain,

<P>but a great stickler to encourage Mansoul to rebellion.&nbsp; He

<P>received a wound in the eye by the hand of one of Boanerges'

<P>soldiers, and had by the captain himself been slain, but that

<P>he made a sudden retreat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But I never saw Willbewill so daunted in all my life; he was

<P>not able to do as he was wont, and some say that he also

<P>received a wound in the leg, and that some of the men in the

<P>Prince's army have certainly seen him limp as he afterwards

<P>walked on the wall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I shall not give you a particular account of the names of the

<P>soldiers that were slain in the town, for many were maimed,

<P>and wounded, and slain; for when they saw that the posts of

<P>Ear-gate did shake, and Eye-gate was well-nigh broken quite

<P>open, and also that their captains were slain, this took away

<P>the hearts of many of the Diabolonians; they fell also by the

<P>force of the shot that were sent by the golden slings into

<P>the midst of the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of the townsmen, there was one Love-no-Good; he was a

<P>townsman, but a Diabolonian; he also received his mortal

<P>wound in Mansoul, but he died not very soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Ill-Pause also, who was the man that came along with

<P>Diabolus when at first he attempted the taking of Mansoul, he

<P>also received a grievous wound in the head; some say that his

<P>brain-pan was cracked.&nbsp; This I have taken notice of, that he

<P>was never after this able to do that mischief to Mansoul as

<P>he had done in times past.&nbsp; Also old Prejudice and Mr.

<P>Anything fled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the battle was over, the Prince commanded that yet

<P>once more the white flag should be set upon Mount Gracious in

<P>sight of the town of Mansoul, to show that yet Emmanuel had

<P>grace for the wretched town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus saw the white flag hung out again, and knowing

<P>that it was not for him, but Mansoul, he cast in his mind to

<P>play another prank, to wit, to see if Emmanuel would raise

<P>his siege and begone, upon promise of reformation.&nbsp; So he

<P>comes down to the gate one evening, a good while after the

<P>sun was gone down, and calls to speak with Emmanuel, who

<P>presently came down to the gate, and Diabolus saith unto him:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Forasmuch as thou makest it appear by thy white flag that

<P>thou art wholly given to peace and quiet, I thought meet to

<P>acquaint thee that we are ready to accept thereof upon terms

<P>which thou mayest admit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'I know that thou art given to devotion, and that holiness

<P>pleaseth thee; yea, that thy great end in making a war upon

<P>Mansoul is, that it may be a holy habitation.&nbsp; Well, draw off

<P>thy forces from the town, and I will bend Mansoul to thy bow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'First, I will lay down all acts of hostility against thee,

<P>and will be willing to become thy deputy, and will, as I have

<P>formerly been against thee, now serve thee in the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; And more particularly,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'1. I will persuade Mansoul to receive thee for their Lord;

<P>and I know that they will do it the sooner when they shall

<P>understand that I am thy deputy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'2. I will show them wherein they have erred, and that

<P>transgression stands in the way to life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'3. I will show them the holy law unto which they must

<P>conform, even that which they have broken.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'4. I will press upon them the necessity of a reformation

<P>according to thy law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'5. And, moreover, that none of these things may fail, I

<P>myself, at my own proper cost and charge, will set up and

<P>maintain a sufficient ministry, besides lectures, in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'6. Thou shalt receive, as a token of our subjection to thee,

<P>year by year, what thou shalt think fit to lay and levy upon

<P>us in token of our subjection to thee.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Emmanuel to him, 'O full of deceit, how movable are

<P>thy ways!&nbsp; How often hast thou changed and rechanged, if so

<P>be thou mightest still keep possession of my Mansoul, though,

<P>as has been plainly declared before, I am the right heir

<P>thereof!&nbsp; Often hast thou made thy proposals already, nor is

<P>this last a whit better than they.&nbsp; And failing to deceive

<P>when thou showedst thyself in thy black, thou hast now

<P>transformed thyself into an angel of light, and wouldst, to

<P>deceive, be now as a minister of righteousness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'But know thou, O Diabolus, that nothing must be regarded

<P>that thou canst propound, for nothing is done by thee but to

<P>deceive.&nbsp; Thou neither hast conscience to God, nor love to

<P>the town of Mansoul; whence, then, should these thy sayings

<P>arise but from sinful craft and deceit?&nbsp; He that can of list

<P>and will propound what he pleases, and that wherewith he may

<P>destroy them that believe him, is to be abandoned, with all

<P>that he shall say.&nbsp; But if righteousness be such a beauty-

<P>spot in thine eyes now, how is it that wickedness was so

<P>closely stuck to by thee before?&nbsp; But this is by-the-bye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou talkest now of a reformation in Mansoul, and that thou

<P>thyself, if I will please, wilt be at the head of that

<P>reformation; all the while knowing that the greatest

<P>proficiency that man can make in the law, and the

<P>righteousness thereof, will amount to no more, for the taking

<P>away of the curse from Mansoul, than just nothing at all; for

<P>a law being broken by Mansoul, that had before, upon a

<P>supposition of the breach thereof, a curse pronounced against

<P>him for it of God, can never, by his obeying of the law,

<P>deliver himself therefrom (to say nothing of what a

<P>reformation is like to be set up in Mansoul when the devil is

<P>become corrector of vice).&nbsp; Thou knowest that all that thou

<P>hast now said in this matter is nothing but guile and deceit;

<P>and is, as it was the first, so is it the last card that thou

<P>hast to play.&nbsp; Many there be that do soon discern thee when

<P>thou showest them thy cloven foot; but in thy white, thy

<P>light, and in thy transformation, thou art seen but of a few.

<P>But thou shalt not do thus with my Mansoul, O Diabolus; for I

<P>do still love my Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Besides, I am not come to put Mansoul upon works to live

<P>thereby; should I do so, I should be like unto thee: but I am

<P>come that by me, and by what I have and shall do for Mansoul,

<P>they may to my Father be reconciled, though by their sin they

<P>have provoked him to anger, and though by the law they cannot

<P>obtain mercy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Thou talkest of subjecting of this town to good, when none

<P>desireth it at thy hands.&nbsp; I am sent by my Father to possess

<P>it myself, and to guide it by the skilfulness of my hands

<P>into such a conformity to him as shall be pleasing in his

<P>sight.&nbsp; I will therefore possess it myself; I will dispossess

<P>and cast thee out; I will set up mine own standard in the

<P>midst of them; I will also govern them by new laws, new

<P>officers, new motives, and new ways; yea, I will pull down

<P>this town, and build it again; and it shall be as though it

<P>had not been, and it shall then be the glory of the whole

<P>universe.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Diabolus heard this, and perceived that he was

<P>discovered in all his deceits, he was confounded, and utterly

<P>put to a nonplus; but having in himself the fountain of

<P>iniquity, rage, and malice against both Shaddai and his Son,

<P>and the beloved town of Mansoul, what doth he but strengthen

<P>himself what he could to give fresh battle to the noble

<P>Prince Emmanuel?&nbsp; So, then, now we must have another fight

<P>before the town of Mansoul is taken.&nbsp; Come up, then, to the

<P>mountains, you that love to see military actions, and behold

<P>by both sides how the fatal blow is given, while one seeks to

<P>hold, and the other seeks to make himself master of the

<P>famous town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus, therefore, having withdrawn himself from the wall

<P>to his force that was in the heart of the town of Mansoul,

<P>Emmanuel also returned to the camp; and both of them, after

<P>their divers ways, put themselves into a posture fit to give

<P>battle one to another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Diabolus, as filled with despair of retaining in his hands

<P>the famous town of Mansoul, resolved to do what mischief he

<P>could (if, indeed, he could do any) to the army of the Prince

<P>and to the famous town of Mansoul; for, alas! it was not the

<P>happiness of the silly town of Mansoul that was designed by

<P>Diabolus, but the utter ruin and overthrow thereof, as now is

<P>enough in view.&nbsp; Wherefore, he commands his officers that

<P>they should then, when they see that they could hold the town

<P>no longer, do it what harm and mischief they could, rendering

<P>and tearing men, women, and children.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'we

<P>had better quite demolish the place, and leave it like a

<P>ruinous heap, than so leave it that it may be an habitation

<P>for Emmanuel.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emmanuel again, knowing that the next battle would issue in

<P>his being made master of the place, gave out a royal

<P>commandment to all his officers, high captains, and men of

<P>war, to be sure to show themselves men of war against

<P>Diabolus and all Diabolonians; but favourable, merciful, and

<P>meek to the old inhabitants of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'Bend, therefore,'

<P>said the noble Prince, 'the hottest front of the battle

<P>against Diabolus and his men.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the day being come, the command was given, and the

<P>Prince's men did bravely stand to their arms, and did, as

<P>before, bend their main force against Ear-gate and Eye-gate.

<P>The word was then, 'Mansoul is won!' so they made their

<P>assault upon the town.&nbsp; Diabolus also, as fast as he could,

<P>with the main of his power, made resistance from within; and

<P>his high lords and chief captains for a time fought very

<P>cruelly against the Prince's army.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But after three or four notable charges by the Prince and his

<P>noble captains, Ear-gate was broken open, and the bars and

<P>bolts wherewith it was used to be fast shut up against the

<P>Prince, were broken into a thousand pieces.&nbsp; Then did the

<P>Prince's trumpets sound, the captains shout, the town shake,

<P>and Diabolus retreat to his hold.&nbsp; Well, when the Prince's

<P>forces had broken open the gate, himself came up and did set

<P>his throne in it; also he set his standard thereby, upon a

<P>mount that before by his men was cast up to place the mighty

<P>slings thereon.&nbsp; The mount was called Mount Hear-well.

<P>There, therefore, the Prince abode, to wit, hard by the going

<P>in at the gate.&nbsp; He commanded also that the golden slings

<P>should yet be played upon the town, especially against the

<P>castle, because for shelter thither was Diabolus retreated.

<P>Now, from Ear-gate the street was straight even to the house

<P>of Mr. Recorder that so was before Diabolus took the town;

<P>and hard by his house stood the castle, which Diabolus for a

<P>long time had made his irksome den.&nbsp; The captains, therefore,

<P>did quickly clear that street by the use of their slings, so

<P>that way was made up to the heart of the town.&nbsp; Then did the

<P>Prince command that Captain Boanerges, Captain Conviction,

<P>and Captain Judgment, should forthwith march up the town to

<P>the old gentleman's gate.&nbsp; Then did the captains in the most

<P>warlike manner enter into the town of Mansoul, and marching

<P>in with flying colours, they came up to the Recorder's house,

<P>and that was almost as strong as was the castle.&nbsp; Battering-

<P>rams they took also with them, to plant against the castle

<P>gates.&nbsp; When they were come to the house of Mr. Conscience,

<P>they knocked, and demanded entrance.&nbsp; Now, the old gentleman,

<P>not knowing as yet fully their design, kept his gates shut

<P>all the time of this fight.&nbsp; Wherefore Boanerges demanded

<P>entrance at his gates; and no man making answer, he gave it

<P>one stroke with the head of a ram, and this made the old

<P>gentleman shake, and his house to tremble and totter.&nbsp; Then

<P>came Mr. Recorder down to the gates, and, as he could, with

<P>quivering lips he asked who was there?&nbsp; Boanerges answered,

<P>'We are the captains and commanders of the great Shaddai and

<P>of the blessed Emmanuel, his Son, and we demand possession of

<P>your house for the use of our noble Prince.'&nbsp; And with that

<P>the battering-ram gave the gate another shake.&nbsp; This made the

<P>old gentleman tremble the more, yet durst he not but open the

<P>gate: then the King's forces marched in, namely, the three

<P>brave captains mentioned before.&nbsp; Now, the Recorder's house

<P>was a place of much convenience for Emmanuel, not only

<P>because it was near to the castle and strong, but also

<P>because it was large, and fronted the castle, the den where

<P>now Diabolus was, for he was now afraid to come out of his

<P>hold.&nbsp; As for Mr. Recorder, the captains carried it very

<P>reservedly to him; as yet he knew nothing of the great

<P>designs of Emmanuel, so that he did not know what judgment to

<P>make, nor what would be the end of such thundering

<P>beginnings.&nbsp; It was also presently noised in the town how the

<P>Recorder's house was possessed, his rooms taken up, and his

<P>palace made the seat of the war; and no sooner was it noised

<P>abroad, but they took the alarm as warmly, and gave it out to

<P>others of his friends, and you know, as a snowball loses

<P>nothing by rolling, so in little time the whole town was

<P>possessed that they must expect nothing from the Prince but

<P>destruction; and the ground of the business was this, the

<P>Recorder was afraid, the Recorder trembled, and the captains

<P>carried it strangely to the Recorder.&nbsp; So many came to see,

<P>but when they with their own eyes did behold the captains in

<P>the palace, and their battering-rams ever playing at the

<P>castle gates to beat them down, they were riveted in their

<P>fears, and it made them all in amaze.&nbsp; And, as I said, the

<P>man of the house would increase all this; for whoever came to

<P>him, or discoursed with him, nothing would he talk of, tell

<P>them, or hear, but that death and destruction now attended

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'For,' quoth the old gentleman, 'you are all of you sensible

<P>that we all have been traitors to that once despised, but now

<P>famously victorious and glorious Prince Emmanuel; for he now,

<P>as you see, doth not only lie in close siege about us, but

<P>hath forced his entrance in at our gates.&nbsp; Moreover, Diabolus

<P>flees before him; and he hath, as you behold, made of my

<P>house a garrison against the castle where he is.&nbsp; I, for my

<P>part, have transgressed greatly, and he that is clean, it is

<P>well for him.&nbsp; But I say I have transgressed greatly in

<P>keeping silence when I should have spoken, and in perverting

<P>justice when I should have executed the same.&nbsp; True, I have

<P>suffered something at the hand of Diabolus for taking part

<P>with the laws of King Shaddai; but that, alas! what will that

<P>do? Will that make compensation for the rebellions and

<P>treasons that I have done, and have suffered without

<P>gainsaying to be committed in the town of Mansoul? Oh! I

<P>tremble to think what will be the end of this so dreadful and

<P>so ireful a beginning!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, while these brave captains were thus busy in the house

<P>of the old Recorder, Captain Execution was as busy in other

<P>parts of the town, in securing the back streets and the

<P>walls.&nbsp; He also hunted the Lord Willbewill sorely; he

<P>suffered him not to rest in any corner; he pursued him so

<P>hard that he drove his men from him, and made him glad to

<P>thrust his head into a hole.&nbsp; Also this mighty warrior did

<P>cut three of the Lord Willbewill's officers down to the

<P>ground: one was old Mr. Prejudice, he that had his crown

<P>cracked in the mutiny.&nbsp; This man was made by Lord Willbewill

<P>keeper of the Ear-gate, and fell by the hand of Captain

<P>Execution.&nbsp; There was also one Mr. Backward-to-all-but-

<P>naught, and he also was one of Lord Willbewill's officers,

<P>and was the captain of the two guns that once were mounted on

<P>the top of Ear-gate; he also was cut down to the ground by

<P>the hands of Captain Execution.&nbsp; Besides these two there was

<P>another, a third, and his name was Captain Treacherous; a

<P>vile man this was, but one that Willbewill did put a great

<P>deal of confidence in; but him also did this Captain

<P>Execution cut down to the ground with the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He also made a very great slaughter among my Lord

<P>Willbewill's soldiers, killing many that were stout and

<P>sturdy, and wounding many that for Diabolus were nimble and

<P>active.&nbsp; But all these were Diabolonians; there was not a

<P>man, a native of Mansoul, hurt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Other feats of war were also likewise performed by other of

<P>the captains, as at Eye-gate, where Captain Good-Hope and

<P>Captain Charity had a charge, was great execution done; for

<P>the Captain Good-Hope, with his own hands, slew one Captain

<P>Blindfold, the keeper of that gate.&nbsp; This Blindfold was

<P>captain of a thousand men, and they were they that fought

<P>with mauls; he also pursued his men, slew many, and wounded

<P>more, and made the rest hide their heads in corners.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was also at that gate Mr. Ill-Pause, of whom you have

<P>heard before.&nbsp; He was an old man, and had a beard that

<P>reached down to his girdle: the same was he that was orator

<P>to Diabolus: he did much mischief in the town of Mansoul, and

<P>fell by the hand of Captain Good-Hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What shall I say?&nbsp; The Diabolonians in these days lay dead in

<P>every corner, though too many yet were alive in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the old Recorder and my Lord Understanding, with some

<P>others of the chief of the town, to wit, such as knew they

<P>must stand and fall with the famous town of Mansoul, came

<P>together upon a day, and after consultation had, did jointly

<P>agree to draw up a petition, and to send it to Emmanuel, now

<P>while he sat in the gate of Mansoul.&nbsp; So they drew up their

<P>petition to Emmanuel, the contents whereof were these: That

<P>they, the old inhabitants of the now deplorable town of

<P>Mansoul, confessed their sin, and were sorry that they had

<P>offended his princely Majesty, and prayed that he would spare

<P>their lives.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Unto this petition he gave no answer at all, and that did

<P>trouble them yet so much the more.&nbsp; Now, all this while the

<P>captains that were in the Recorder's house were playing with

<P>the battering-rams at the gates of the castle, to beat them

<P>down.&nbsp; So after some time, labour, and travail, the gate of

<P>the castle that was called Impregnable was beaten open, and

<P>broken into several splinters, and so a way made to go up to

<P>the hold in which Diabolus had hid himself.&nbsp; Then were

<P>tidings sent down to Ear-gate, for Emmanuel still abode

<P>there, to let him know that a way was made in at the gates of

<P>the castle of Mansoul.&nbsp; But, oh! how the trumpets at the

<P>tidings sounded throughout the Prince's camp, for that now

<P>the war was so near an end, and Mansoul itself of being set

<P>free.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the Prince arose from the place where he was, and took

<P>with him such of his men of war as were fittest for that

<P>expedition, and marched up the street of Mansoul to the old

<P>Recorder's house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the Prince himself was clad all in armour of gold, and

<P>so he marched up the town with his standard borne before him;

<P>but he kept his countenance much reserved all the way as he

<P>went, so that the people could not tell how to gather to

<P>themselves love or hatred by his looks.&nbsp; Now, as he marched

<P>up the street, the townsfolk came out at every door to see,

<P>and could not but be taken with his person and the glory

<P>thereof, but wondered at the reservedness of his countenance;

<P>for as yet he spake more to them by his actions and works

<P>than he did by words or smiles.&nbsp; But also poor Mansoul, (as

<P>in such cases all are apt to do,) they interpreted the

<P>carriage of Emmanuel to them as did Joseph's brethren his to

<P>them, even all the quite contrary way.&nbsp; 'For,' thought they,

<P>'if Emmanuel loved us, he would show it to us by word of

<P>carriage; but none of these he doth, therefore Emmanuel hates

<P>us.&nbsp; Now, if Emmanuel hates us, then Mansoul shall be slain,

<P>then Mansoul shall become a dunghill.'&nbsp; They knew that they

<P>had transgressed his Father's law, and that against him they

<P>had been in with Diabolus, his enemy.&nbsp; They also knew that

<P>the Prince Emmanuel knew all this; for they were convinced

<P>that he was an angel of God, to know all things that are done

<P>in the earth; and this made them think that their condition

<P>was miserable, and that the good Prince would make them

<P>desolate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'And,' thought they, 'what time so fit to do this in as now,

<P>when he has the bridle of Mansoul in his hand?'&nbsp; And this I

<P>took special notice of, that the inhabitants, notwithstanding

<P>all this, could not - no, they could not, when they see him

<P>march through the town, but cringe, bow, bend, and were ready

<P>to lick the dust of his feet.&nbsp; They also wished a thousand

<P>times over that he would become their Prince and Captain, and

<P>would become their protection.&nbsp; They would also one to

<P>another talk of the comeliness of his person, and how much

<P>for glory and valour he outstripped the great ones of the

<P>world.&nbsp; But, poor hearts, as to themselves, their thoughts

<P>would chance, and go upon all manner of extremes.&nbsp; Yea,

<P>through the working of them backward and forward, Mansoul

<P>became as a ball tossed, and as a rolling thing before the

<P>whirlwind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when he was come to the castle gates, he commanded

<P>Diabolus to appear, and to surrender himself into his hands.

<P>But, oh! how loath was the beast to appear! how he stuck at

<P>it! how he shrank! how he cringed! yet out he came to the

<P>Prince.&nbsp; Then Emmanuel commanded, and they took Diabolus and

<P>bound him fast in chains, the better to reserve him to the

<P>judgment that he had appointed for him.&nbsp; But Diabolus stood

<P>up to entreat for himself that Emmanuel would not send him

<P>into the deep, but suffer him to depart out of Mansoul in

<P>peace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Emmanuel had taken him and bound him in chains, he led

<P>him into the marketplace, and there, before Mansoul, stripped

<P>him of his armour in which he boasted so much before.&nbsp; This

<P>now was one of the acts of triumph of Emmanuel over his

<P>enemy; and all the while that the giant was stripping, the

<P>trumpets of the golden Prince did sound amain; the captains

<P>also shouted, and the soldiers did sing for joy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then was Mansoul called upon to behold the beginning of

<P>Emmanuel's triumph over him in whom they so much had trusted,

<P>and of whom they so much had boasted in the days when he

<P>flattered them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus having made Diabolus naked in the eyes of Mansoul, and

<P>before the commanders of the Prince, in the next place, he

<P>commands that Diabolus should be bound with chains to his

<P>chariot wheels.&nbsp; Then leaving some of his forces, to wit,

<P>Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction, as a guard for the

<P>castle-gates, that resistance might be made on his behalf,

<P>(if any that heretofore followed Diabolus should make an

<P>attempt to possess it,) he did ride in triumph over him quite

<P>through the town of Mansoul, and so out at and before the

<P>gate called Eye-gate, to the plain where his camp did lie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But you cannot think, unless you had been there, as I was,

<P>what a shout there was in Emmanuel's camp when they saw the

<P>tyrant bound by the hand of their noble Prince, and tied to

<P>his chariot wheels!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And they said, 'He hath led captivity captive, he hath

<P>spoiled principalities and powers.&nbsp; Diabolus is subjected to

<P>the power of his sword, and made the object of all derision.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Those also that rode reformades, and that came down to see

<P>the battle, they shouted with that greatness of voice, and

<P>sung with such melodious notes, that they caused them that

<P>dwell in the highest orbs to open their windows, put out

<P>their heads, and look to see the cause of that glory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The townsmen also, so many of them as saw this sight, were,

<P>as it were, while they looked, betwixt the earth and the

<P>heavens.&nbsp; True, they could not tell what would be the issue

<P>of things as to them; but all things were done in such

<P>excellent methods, and I cannot tell how, but things in the

<P>management of them seemed to cast a smile towards the town,

<P>so that their eyes, their heads, their hearts, and their

<P>minds, and all that they had, were taken and held while they

<P>observed Emmanuel's order.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, when the brave Prince had finished this part of his

<P>triumph over Diabolus his foe, he turned him up in the midst

<P>of his contempt and shame, having given him a charge no more

<P>to be a possessor of Mansoul.&nbsp; Then went he from Emmanuel,

<P>and out of the midst of his camp, to inherit the parched

<P>places in a salt land, seeking rest, but finding none.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction were, both of

<P>them, men of very great majesty; their faces were like the

<P>faces of lions, and their words like the roaring of the sea;

<P>and they still quartered in Mr. Conscience's house, of whom

<P>mention was made before.&nbsp; When, therefore, the high and

<P>mighty Prince had thus far finished his triumph over

<P>Diabolus, the townsmen had more leisure to view and to behold

<P>the actions of these noble captains.&nbsp; But the captains

<P>carried it with that terror and dread in all that they did,

<P>(and you may be sure that they had private instructions so to

<P>do,) that they kept the town under continual heart-aching,

<P>and caused (in their apprehension) the well-being of Mansoul

<P>for the future to hang in doubt before them, so that for some

<P>considerable time they neither knew what rest, or ease, or

<P>peace, or hope meant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nor did the Prince himself as yet abide in the town of

<P>Mansoul, but in his royal pavilion in the camp, and in the

<P>midst of his Father's forces.&nbsp; So, at a time convenient, he

<P>sent special orders to Captain Boanerges to summons Mansoul,

<P>the whole of the townsmen, into the castle-yard, and then and

<P>there, before their faces, to take my Lord Understanding, Mr.

<P>Conscience, and that notable one, the Lord Willbewill, and

<P>put them all three in ward, and that they should set a strong

<P>guard upon them there, until his pleasure concerning them was

<P>further known: the which orders, when the captains had put

<P>them in execution, made no small addition to the fears of the

<P>town of Mansoul; for now, to their thinking, were their

<P>former fears of the ruin of Mansoul confirmed.&nbsp; Now, what

<P>death they should die, and how long they should be in dying,

<P>was that which most perplexed their heads and hearts; yea,

<P>they were afraid that Emmanuel would command them all into

<P>the deep, the place that the prince Diabolus was afraid of,

<P>for they knew that they had deserved it.&nbsp; Also to die by the

<P>sword in the face of the town, and in the open way of

<P>disgrace, from the hand of so good and so holy a prince,

<P>that, too, troubled them sore.&nbsp; The town was also greatly

<P>troubled for the men that were committed to ward, for that

<P>they were their stay and their guide, and for that they

<P>believed that, if those men were cut off, their execution

<P>would be but the beginning of the ruin of the town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore, what do they, but, together with the men

<P>in prison, draw up a petition to the Prince, and sent it to

<P>Emmanuel by the hand of Mr. Would-live.&nbsp; So he went, and came

<P>to the Prince's quarters, and presented the petition, the sum

<P>of which was this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Great and wonderful Potentate, victor over Diabolus, and

<P>conqueror of the town of Mansoul, We, the miserable

<P>inhabitants of that most woful corporation, do humbly beg

<P>that we may find favour in thy sight, and remember not

<P>against us former transgressions, nor yet the sins of the

<P>chief of our town: but spare us according to the greatness of

<P>thy mercy, and let us not die, but live in thy sight.&nbsp; So

<P>shall we be willing to be thy servants, and, if thou shalt

<P>think fit, to gather our meat under thy table.&nbsp; Amen.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the petitioner went, as was said, with his petition to the

<P>Prince; and the Prince took it at his hand, but sent him away

<P>with silence.&nbsp; This still afflicted the town of Mansoul; but

<P>yet, considering that now they must either petition or die,

<P>for now they could not do anything else, therefore they

<P>consulted again, and sent another petition; and this petition

<P>was much after the form and method of the former.
