<P>But when the petition was drawn up, By whom should they send

<P>it? was the next question; for they would not send this by

<P>him by whom they sent the first, for they thought that the

<P>Prince had taken some offence at the manner of his deportment

<P>before him: so they attempted to make Captain Conviction

<P>their messenger with it; but he said that he neither durst

<P>nor would petition Emmanuel for traitors, nor be to the

<P>Prince an advocate for rebels.&nbsp; 'Yet withal,' said he, 'our

<P>Prince is good, and you may adventure to send it by the hand

<P>of one of your town, provided he went with a rope about his

<P>head, and pleaded nothing but mercy.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, they made, through fear, their delays as long as they

<P>could, and longer than delays were good; but fearing at last

<P>the dangerousness of them, they thought, but with many a

<P>fainting in their minds, to send their petition by Mr.

<P>Desires-awake; so they sent for Mr. Desires-awake.&nbsp; Now he

<P>dwelt in a very mean cottage in Mansoul, and he came at his

<P>neighbour's request.&nbsp; So they told him what they had done,

<P>and what they would do, concerning petitioning, and that they

<P>did desire of him that he would go therewith to the Prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Desires-awake, 'Why should not I do the best I

<P>can to save so famous a town as Mansoul from deserved

<P>destruction?'&nbsp; They therefore delivered the petition to him,

<P>and told him how he must address himself to the Prince, and

<P>wished him ten thousand good speeds.&nbsp; So he comes to the

<P>Prince's pavilion, as the first, and asked to speak with his

<P>Majesty.&nbsp; So word was carried to Emmanuel, and the Prince

<P>came out to the man.&nbsp; When Mr. Desires-awake saw the Prince,

<P>he fell flat with his face to the ground, and cried out, 'Oh

<P>that Mansoul might live before thee!' and with that he

<P>presented the petition; the which when the Prince had read,

<P>he turned away for a while and wept; but refraining himself,

<P>he turned again to the man, who all this while lay crying at

<P>his feet, as at the first, and said to him, 'Go thy way to

<P>thy place, and I will consider of thy requests.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, you may think that they of Mansoul that had sent him,

<P>what with guilt, and what with fear lest their petition

<P>should be rejected, could not but look with many a long look,

<P>and that, too, with strange workings of heart, to see what

<P>would become of their petition.&nbsp; At last they saw their

<P>messenger coming back.&nbsp; So, when he was come, they asked him

<P>how he fared, what Emmanuel said, and what was become of the

<P>petition.&nbsp; But he told them that he would be silent till he

<P>came to the prison to my Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and

<P>Mr. Recorder.&nbsp; So he went forwards towards the prison-house,

<P>where the men of Mansoul lay bound.&nbsp; But, oh! what a

<P>multitude flocked after, to hear what the messenger said.

<P>So, when he was come, and had shown himself at the gate of

<P>the prison, my Lord Mayor himself looked as white as a clout;

<P>the Recorder also did quake.&nbsp; But they asked and said, 'Come,

<P>good sir, what did the great Prince say to you?'&nbsp; Then said

<P>Mr. Desires-awake, 'When I came to my Lord's pavilion, I

<P>called, and he came forth.&nbsp; So I fell prostrate at his feet,

<P>and delivered to him my petition; for the greatness of his

<P>person, and the glory of his countenance, would not suffer me

<P>to stand upon my legs.&nbsp; Now, as he received the petition, I

<P>cried, "Oh that Mansoul might live before thee!"&nbsp; So, when

<P>for a while he had looked thereon, he turned him about, and

<P>said to his servant, "Go thy way to thy place again, and I

<P>will consider of thy requests."'&nbsp; The messenger added,

<P>moreover, and said, 'The Prince to whom you sent me is such a

<P>one for beauty and glory, that whoso sees him must both love

<P>and fear him.&nbsp; I, for my part, can do no less; but I know not

<P>what will be the end of these things.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this answer they were all at a stand, both they in prison,

<P>and they that followed the messenger thither to hear the

<P>news; nor knew they what, or what manner of interpretation to

<P>put upon what the Prince had said.&nbsp; Now, when the prison was

<P>cleared of the throng, the prisoners among themselves began

<P>to comment upon Emmanuel's words.&nbsp; My Lord Mayor said, that

<P>the answer did not look with a rugged face; but Willbewill

<P>said that it betokened evil; and the Recorder, that it was a

<P>messenger of death.&nbsp; Now, they that were left, and that stood

<P>behind, and so could not so well hear what the prisoners

<P>said, some of them catched hold of one piece of a sentence,

<P>and some on a bit of another; some took hold of what the

<P>messenger said, and some of the prisoners' judgment thereon;

<P>so none had the right understanding of things.&nbsp; But you

<P>cannot imagine what work these people made, and what a

<P>confusion there was in Mansoul now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For presently they that had heard what was said flew about

<P>the town, one crying one thing, and another the quite

<P>contrary; and both were sure enough they told true; for they

<P>did hear, they said, with their ears what was said, and

<P>therefore could not be deceived.&nbsp; One would say, 'We must all

<P>be killed;' another would say, 'We must all be saved;' and a

<P>third would say that the Prince would not be concerned with

<P>Mansoul; and a fourth, that the prisoners must be suddenly

<P>put to death.&nbsp; And, as I said, every one stood to it that he

<P>told his tale the rightest, and that all others but he were

<P>out.&nbsp; Wherefore Mansoul had now molestation upon molestation,

<P>nor could any man know on what to rest the sole of his foot;

<P>for one would go by now, and as he went, if he heard his

<P>neighbour tell his tale, to be sure he would tell the quite

<P>contrary, and both would stand in it that he told the truth.

<P>Nay, some of them had got this story by the end, that the

<P>Prince did intend to put Mansoul to the sword.&nbsp; And now it

<P>began to be dark, wherefore poor Mansoul was in sad

<P>perplexity all that night until the morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, so far as I could gather by the best information that I

<P>could get, all this hubbub came through the words that the

<P>Recorder said when he told them that, in his judgment, the

<P>Prince's answer was a messenger of death.&nbsp; It was this that

<P>fired the town, and that began the fright in Mansoul; for

<P>Mansoul in former times did use to count that Mr. Recorder

<P>was a seer, and that his sentence was equal to the best of

<P>orators; and thus was Mansoul a terror to itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now did they begin to feel what were the effects of

<P>stubborn rebellion, and unlawful resistance against their

<P>Prince.&nbsp; I say, they now began to feel the effects thereof by

<P>guilt and fear, that now had swallowed them up; and who more

<P>involved in the one but they that were most in the other, to

<P>wit, the chief of the town of Mansoul?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To be brief: when the fame of the fright was out of the town,

<P>and the prisoners had a little recovered themselves, they

<P>take to themselves some heart, and think to petition the

<P>Prince for life again.&nbsp; So they did draw up a third petition,

<P>the contents whereof were these:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Prince Emmanuel the Great, Lord of all worlds, and Master of

<P>mercy, we, thy poor, wretched, miserable, dying town of

<P>Mansoul, do confess unto thy great and glorious Majesty that

<P>we have sinned against thy Father and thee, and are no more

<P>worthy to be called thy Mansoul, but rather to be cast into

<P>the pit.&nbsp; If thou wilt slay us, we have deserved it.&nbsp; If thou

<P>wilt condemn us to the deep, we cannot but say thou art

<P>righteous.&nbsp; We cannot complain whatever thou dost, or however

<P>thou carriest it towards us.&nbsp; But, oh! let mercy reign, and

<P>let it be extended to us!&nbsp; Oh! let mercy take hold upon us,

<P>and free us from our transgressions, and we will sing of thy

<P>mercy and of thy judgment.&nbsp; Amen.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This petition, when drawn up, was designed to be sent to the

<P>Prince as the first.&nbsp; But who should carry it? - that was the

<P>question.&nbsp; Some said, 'Let him do it that went with the

<P>first,' but others thought not good to do that, and that

<P>because he sped no better.&nbsp; Now, there was an old man in the

<P>town, and his name was Mr. Good-Deed; a man that bare only

<P>the name, but had nothing of the nature of the thing.&nbsp; Now,

<P>some were for sending him; but the Recorder was by no means

<P>for that.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'we now stand in need of, and are

<P>pleading for mercy: wherefore, to send our petition by a man

<P>of this name, will seem to cross the petition itself.&nbsp; Should

<P>we make Mr. Good-Deed our messenger, when our petition cries

<P>for mercy?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Besides,' quoth the old gentleman, 'should the Prince now,

<P>as he receives the petition, ask him, and say, "What is thy

<P>name?" as nobody knows but he will, and he should say, "Old

<P>Good-Deed," what, think you, would Emmanuel say but this?

<P>"Ay! is old Good-Deed yet alive in Mansoul? then let old

<P>Good-Deed save you from your distresses."&nbsp; And if he says so,

<P>I am sure we are lost; nor can a thousand of old Good-Deeds

<P>save Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After the Recorder had given in his reasons why old Good-Deed

<P>should not go with this petition to Emmanuel, the rest of the

<P>prisoners and chief of Mansoul opposed it also, and so old

<P>Good-Deed was laid aside, and they agreed to send Mr.

<P>Desires-awake again.&nbsp; So they sent for him, and desired him

<P>that he would a second time go with their petition to the

<P>Prince, and he readily told them he would.&nbsp; But they bid him

<P>that in anywise he should take heed that in no word or

<P>carriage he gave offence to the Prince; 'For by doing so, for

<P>ought we can tell, you may bring Mansoul into utter

<P>destruction,' said they.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Mr. Desires-awake, when he saw that he must go on this

<P>errand, besought that they would grant that Mr. Wet-Eyes

<P>might go with him.&nbsp; Now this Mr. Wet-Eyes was a near

<P>neighbour of Mr. Desires, a poor man, a man of a broken

<P>spirit, yet one that could speak well to a petition; so they

<P>granted that he should go with him.&nbsp; Wherefore, they address

<P>themselves to their business: Mr. Desires put a rope upon his

<P>head, and Mr. Wet-Eyes went with his hands wringing together.

<P>Thus they went to the Prince's pavilion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when they went to petition this third time, they were

<P>not without thoughts that, by often coming, they might be a

<P>burden to the Prince.&nbsp; Wherefore, when they were come to the

<P>door of his pavilion, they first made their apology for

<P>themselves, and for their coming to trouble Emmanuel so

<P>often; and they said, that they came not hither to-day for

<P>that they delighted in being troublesome, or for that they

<P>delighted to hear themselves talk, but for that necessity

<P>caused them to come to his Majesty.&nbsp; They could, they said,

<P>have no rest day nor night because of their transgressions

<P>against Shaddai and against Emmanuel, his Son.&nbsp; They also

<P>thought that some misbehaviour of Mr. Desires-awake the last

<P>time might give distaste to his Highness, and so cause that

<P>he returned from so merciful a Prince empty, and without

<P>countenance.&nbsp; So, when they had made this apology, Mr.

<P>Desires-awake cast himself prostrate upon the ground, as at

<P>the first, at the feet of the mighty Prince, saying, 'Oh!

<P>that Mansoul might live before thee!' and so he delivered his

<P>petition.&nbsp; The Prince then, having read the petition, turned

<P>aside awhile as before, and coming again to the place where

<P>the petitioner lay on the ground, he demanded what his name

<P>was, and of what esteem in the account of Mansoul, for that

<P>he, above all the multitude in Mansoul, should be sent to him

<P>upon such an errand.&nbsp; Then said the man to the Prince, 'Oh

<P>let not my Lord be angry; and why inquirest thou after the

<P>name of such a dead do - as I am?&nbsp; Pass by, I pray thee, and

<P>take not notice of who I am, because there is, as thou very

<P>well knowest, so great a disproportion between me and thee.

<P>Why the townsmen chose to send me on this errand to my Lord

<P>is best known to themselves, but it could not be for that

<P>they thought that I had favour with my Lord.&nbsp; For my part, I

<P>am out of charity with myself; who, then, should be in love

<P>with me?&nbsp; Yet live I would, and so would I that my townsmen

<P>should; and because both they and myself are guilty of great

<P>transgressions, therefore they have sent me, and I am come in

<P>their names to beg of my Lord for mercy.&nbsp; Let it please thee,

<P>therefore, to incline to mercy; but ask not what thy servants

<P>are.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Prince, 'And what is he that is become thy

<P>companion in this so weighty a matter?'&nbsp; So Mr. Desires told

<P>Emmanuel that he was a poor neighbour of his, and one of his

<P>most intimate associates.&nbsp; 'And his name,' said he, 'may it

<P>please your most excellent Majesty, is Wet-Eyes, of the town

<P>of Mansoul, I know that there are many of that name that are

<P>naught; but I hope it will be no offence to my Lord that I

<P>have brought my poor neighbour with me.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Mr. Wet-Eyes fell on his face to the ground, and made

<P>this apology for his coming with his neighbour to his Lord:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'O, my Lord,' quoth he, 'what I am I know not myself, nor

<P>whether my name be feigned or true, especially when I begin

<P>to think what some have said, namely, That this name was

<P>given me because Mr. Repentance was my father.&nbsp; Good men have

<P>bad children, and the sincere do oftentimes beget hypocrites.

<P>My mother also called me by this name from the cradle; but

<P>whether because of the moistness of my brain, or because of

<P>the softness of my heart, I cannot tell.&nbsp; I see dirt in mine

<P>own tears, and filthiness in the bottom of my prayers.&nbsp; But I

<P>pray thee (and all this while the gentleman wept) that thou

<P>wouldest not remember against us our transgressions, nor take

<P>offence at the unqualifiedness of thy servants, but

<P>mercifully pass by the sin of Mansoul, and refrain from the

<P>glorifying of thy grace no longer.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So at his bidding they arose, and both stood trembling before

<P>him, and he spake to them to this purpose:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The town of Mansoul hath grievously rebelled against my

<P>Father, in that they have rejected him from being their King,

<P>and did choose to themselves for their captain a liar, a

<P>murderer, and a runagate slave.&nbsp; For this Diabolus, your

<P>pretended prince, though once so highly accounted of by you,

<P>made rebellion against my Father and me, even in our palace

<P>and highest court there, thinking to become a prince and

<P>king.&nbsp; But being there timely discovered and apprehended, and

<P>for his wickedness bound in chains, and separated to the pit

<P>with those that were his companions, he offered himself to

<P>you, and you have received him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Now this is, and for a long time hath been, a high affront

<P>to my Father; wherefore my Father sent to you a powerful army

<P>to reduce you to your obedience.&nbsp; But you know how these men,

<P>their captains and their counsels, were esteemed of you, and

<P>what they received at your hand.&nbsp; You rebelled against them,

<P>you shut your gates upon them, you bid them battle, you

<P>fought them, and fought for Diabolus against them.&nbsp; So they

<P>sent to my Father for more power, and I, with my men, are

<P>come to subdue you.&nbsp; But as you treated the servants, so you

<P>treated their Lord.&nbsp; You stood up in hostile manner against

<P>me, you shut up your gates against me, you turned the deaf

<P>ear to me, and resisted as long as you could; but now I have

<P>made a conquest of you.&nbsp; Did you cry me mercy so long as you

<P>had hopes that you might prevail against me?&nbsp; But now I have

<P>taken the town, you cry; but why did you not cry before, when

<P>the white flag of my mercy, the red flag of justice, and the

<P>black flag that threatened execution, were set up to cite you

<P>to it?&nbsp; Now I have conquered your Diabolus, you come to me

<P>for favour; but why did you not help me against the mighty?

<P>Yet I will consider your petition, and will answer it so as

<P>will be for my glory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Go, bid Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction bring the

<P>prisoners out to me into the camp to-morrow, and say you to

<P>Captain Judgment and Captain Execution, "Stay you in the

<P>castle, and take good heed to yourselves that you keep all

<P>quiet in Mansoul until you shall hear further from me."'&nbsp; And

<P>with that he turned himself from them, and went into his

<P>royal pavilion again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the petitioners, having received this answer from the

<P>Prince, returned, as at the first, to go to their companions

<P>again.&nbsp; But they had not gone far, but thoughts began to work

<P>in their minds that no mercy as yet was intended by the

<P>Prince to Mansoul.&nbsp; So they went to the place where the

<P>prisoners lay bound; but these workings of mind about what

<P>would become of Mansoul had such strong power over them, that

<P>by that they were come unto them that sent them, they were

<P>scarce able to deliver their message.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But they came at length to the gates of the town, (now the

<P>townsmen with earnestness were waiting for their return,)

<P>where many met them, to know what answer was made to the

<P>petition.&nbsp; Then they cried out to those that were sent, 'What

<P>news from the Prince? and what hath Emmanuel said?'&nbsp; But they

<P>said that they must, as afore, go up to the prison, and there

<P>deliver their message.&nbsp; So away they went to the prison, with

<P>a multitude at their heels.&nbsp; Now, when they were come to the

<P>gates of the prison, they told the first part of Emmanuel's

<P>speech to the prisoners, to wit, how he reflected upon their

<P>disloyalty to his Father and himself, and how they had chosen

<P>and closed with Diabolus, had fought for him, hearkened to

<P>him, and been ruled by him; but had despised him and his men.

<P>This made the prisoners look pale; but the messengers

<P>proceeded and said, 'He, the Prince, said, moreover, that yet

<P>he would consider your petition, and give such answer thereto

<P>as would stand with his glory.'&nbsp; And as these words were

<P>spoken, Mr. Wet-Eyes gave a great sigh.&nbsp; At this they were

<P>all of them struck into their dumps, and could not tell what

<P>to say: fear also possessed them in a marvellous manner, and

<P>death seemed to sit upon some of their eyebrows.&nbsp; Now, there

<P>was in the company a notable, sharp-witted fellow, a mean man

<P>of estate, and his name was old Inquisitive.&nbsp; This man asked

<P>the petitioners if they had told out every whit of what

<P>Emmanuel said, and they answered, 'Verily, no.'&nbsp; Then said

<P>Inquisitive, 'I thought so, indeed.&nbsp; Pray, what was it more

<P>that he said unto you?'&nbsp; Then they paused awhile; but at last

<P>they brought out all, saying, 'The Prince bade us bid Captain

<P>Boanerges and Captain Conviction bring the prisoners down to

<P>him to-morrow; and that Captain Judgment and Captain

<P>Execution should take charge of the castle and town till they

<P>should hear further from him.&nbsp; They said also that when the

<P>Prince had commanded them thus to do, he immediately turned

<P>his back upon them, and went into his royal pavilion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, oh! how this return, and specially this last clause of

<P>it, that the prisoners must go out to the Prince into the

<P>camp, brake all their loins in pieces!&nbsp; Wherefore, with one

<P>voice they set up a cry that reached up to the heavens.&nbsp; This

<P>done, each of the three prepared himself to die; (and the

<P>Recorder said unto them, 'This was the thing that I feared;')

<P>for they concluded that to-morrow, by that the sun went down,

<P>they should be tumbled out of the world.&nbsp; The whole town also

<P>counted of no other, but that, in their time and order, they

<P>must all drink of the same cup.&nbsp; Wherefore the town of

<P>Mansoul spent that night in mourning, and sackcloth and

<P>ashes.&nbsp; The prisoners also, when the time was come for them

<P>to go down before the Prince, dressed themselves in mourning

<P>attire, with ropes upon their heads.&nbsp; The whole town of

<P>Mansoul also showed themselves upon the wall, all clad in

<P>mourning weeds, if, perhaps, the Prince with the sight

<P>thereof might be moved with compassion.&nbsp; But, oh! how the

<P>busy-bodies that were in the town of Mansoul did now concern

<P>themselves!&nbsp; They did run here and there through the streets

<P>of the town by companies, crying out as they ran in

<P>tumultuous wise, one after one manner, and another the quite

<P>contrary, to the almost utter distraction of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, the time is come that the prisoners must go down to the

<P>camp, and appear before the Prince.&nbsp; And thus was the manner

<P>of their going down: Captain Boanerges went with a guard

<P>before them, and Captain Conviction came behind, and the

<P>prisoners went down, bound in chains, in the midst.&nbsp; So I

<P>say, the prisoners went in the midst, and the guard went with

<P>flying colours behind and before, but the prisoners went with

<P>drooping spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Or, more particularly, thus: The prisoners went down all in

<P>mourning: they put ropes upon themselves; they went on,

<P>smiting themselves on the breasts, but durst not lift up

<P>their eyes to heaven.&nbsp; Thus they went out at the gate of

<P>Mansoul, till they came into the midst of the Prince's army,

<P>the sight and glory of which did greatly heighten their

<P>affliction.&nbsp; Nor could they now longer forbear, but cry out

<P>aloud, 'O unhappy men!&nbsp; O wretched men of Mansoul!'&nbsp; Their

<P>chains, still mixing their dolorous notes with the cries of

<P>the prisoners, made the noise more lamentable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, when they were come to the door of the Prince's pavilion,

<P>they cast themselves prostrate upon the place; then one went

<P>in and told his Lord that the prisoners were come down.&nbsp; The

<P>Prince then ascended a throne of state, and sent for the

<P>prisoners in; who, when they came, did tremble before him,

<P>also they covered their faces with shame.&nbsp; Now, as they drew

<P>near to the place where he sat, they threw themselves down

<P>before him.&nbsp; Then said the Prince to the Captain Boanerges,

<P>'Bid the prisoners stand upon their feet.'&nbsp; Then they stood

<P>trembling before him, and he said, 'Are you the men that

<P>heretofore were the servants of Shaddai?'&nbsp; And they said,

<P>'Yes, Lord, yes.'&nbsp; Then said the Prince again, 'Are you the

<P>men that did suffer yourselves to be corrupted and defiled by

<P>that abominable one, Diabolus?'&nbsp; And they said, 'We did more

<P>than suffer it, Lord; for we chose it of our own mind.'&nbsp; The

<P>Prince asked further, saying, 'Could you have been content

<P>that your slavery should have continued under his tyranny as

<P>long as you had lived?'&nbsp; Then said the prisoners, 'Yes, Lord,

<P>yes; for his ways were pleasing to our flesh, and we were

<P>grown aliens to a better state.' - 'And did you,' said he,

<P>'when I came up against this town of Mansoul, heartily wish

<P>that I might not have the victory over you?' - 'Yes, Lord,

<P>yes,' said they.&nbsp; Then said the Prince, 'And what punishment

<P>is it, think you, that you deserve at my hand, for these and

<P>other your high and mighty sins?' - And they said, 'Both

<P>death and the deep, Lord; for we have deserved no less.'&nbsp; He

<P>asked again if they had aught to say for themselves why the

<P>sentence, that they confessed that they had deserved, should

<P>not be passed upon them?&nbsp; And they said, 'We can say nothing,

<P>Lord: thou art just, for we have sinned.'&nbsp; Then said the

<P>Prince, 'And for what are those ropes on your heads?'&nbsp; The

<P>prisoners answered, 'These ropes are to bind us withal to the

<P>place of execution, if mercy be not pleasing in thy sight.'

<P>So he further asked if all the men in the town of Mansoul

<P>were in this confession, as they?&nbsp; And they answered, 'All

<P>the natives, Lord; but for the Diabolonians that came into

<P>our town when the tyrant got possession of us, we can say

<P>nothing for them.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the Prince commanded that a herald should be called, and

<P>that he should, in the midst and throughout the camp of

<P>Emmanuel, proclaim, and that with sound of trumpet, that the

<P>Prince, the Son of Shaddai, had, in his Father's name, and

<P>for his Father's glory, gotten a perfect conquest and victory

<P>over Mansoul; and that the prisoners should follow him, and

<P>say Amen.&nbsp; So, this was done as he had commanded.&nbsp; And

<P>presently the music that was in the upper region sounded

<P>melodiously, the captains that were in the camp shouted, and

<P>the soldiers did sing songs of triumph to the Prince; the

<P>colours waved in the wind, and great joy was everywhere, only

<P>it was wanting as yet in the hearts of the men of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the Prince called for the prisoners to come and to stand

<P>again before him, and they came and stood trembling.&nbsp; And he

<P>said unto them, 'The sins, trespasses, iniquities, that you,

<P>with the whole town of Mansoul, have from time to time

<P>committed against my Father and me, I have power and

<P>commandment from my Father to forgive to the town of Mansoul,

<P>and do forgive you accordingly.'&nbsp; And having so said, he gave

<P>them, written in parchment, and sealed with seven seals, a

<P>large and general pardon, commanding my Lord Mayor, my Lord

<P>Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder, to proclaim and cause it to be

<P>proclaimed to-morrow, by that the sun is up, throughout the

<P>whole town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Moreover, the Prince stripped the prisoners of their mourning

<P>weeds, and gave them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for

<P>mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of

<P>heaviness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he gave to each of the three jewels of gold and precious

<P>stones, and took away their ropes, and put chains of gold

<P>about their necks, and ear-rings in their ears.&nbsp; Now, the

<P>prisoners, when they did hear the gracious words of Prince

<P>Emmanuel, and had beheld all that was done unto them, fainted

<P>almost quite away; for the grace, the benefit, the pardon,

<P>was sudden, glorious, and so big, that they were not able,

<P>without staggering, to stand up under it.&nbsp; Yea, my Lord

<P>Willbewill swooned outright; but the Prince stepped to him,

<P>put his everlasting arms under him, embraced him, kissed him,

<P>and bid him be of good cheer, for all should be performed

<P>according to his word.&nbsp; He also did kiss, and embrace, and

<P>smile upon the other two that were Willbewill's companions,

<P>saying, 'Take these as further tokens of my love, favour, and

<P>compassions to you; and I charge you that you, Mr. Recorder,

<P>tell in the town of Mansoul what you have heard and seen.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then were their fetters broken to pieces before their faces,

<P>and cast into the air, and their steps were enlarged under

<P>them.&nbsp; Then they fell down at the feet of the Prince, and

<P>kissed his feet, and wetted them with tears: also they cried

<P>out with a mighty strong voice, saying, 'Blessed be the glory

<P>of the Lord from this place.'&nbsp; So they were bid rise up, and

<P>go to the town, and tell to Mansoul what the Prince had done.

<P>He commanded also that one with a pipe and tabor should go

<P>and play before them all the way into the town of Mansoul.

<P>Then was fulfilled what they never looked for, and they were

<P>made to possess that which they never dreamed of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Prince also called for the noble Captain Credence, and

<P>commanded that he and some of his officers should march

<P>before the noble men of Mansoul with flying colours into the

<P>town.&nbsp; He gave also unto Captain Credence a charge, that

<P>about that time that the Recorder did read the general pardon

<P>in the town of Mansoul, that at that very time he should with

<P>flying colours march in at Eye-gate with his ten thousands at

<P>his feet and that he should so go until he came by the high

<P>street of the town, up to the castle gates, and that himself

<P>should take possession thereof against his Lord came thither.

<P>He commanded, moreover, that he should bid Captain Judgment

<P>and Captain Execution to leave the stronghold to him, and to

<P>withdraw from Mansoul, and to return into the camp with speed

<P>unto the Prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now was the town of Mansoul also delivered from the

<P>terror of the first four captains and their men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, I told you before how the prisoners were entertained by

<P>the noble Prince Emmanuel, and how they behaved themselves

<P>before him, and how he sent them away to their home with pipe

<P>and tabor going before them.&nbsp; And now you must think that

<P>those of the town that had all this while waited to hear of

<P>their death, could not but be exercised with sadness of mind,

<P>and with thoughts that pricked like thorns.&nbsp; Nor could their

<P>thoughts be kept to any one point; the wind blew with them

<P>all this while at great uncertainties; yea, their hearts were

<P>like a balance that had been disquieted with a shaking hand.

<P>But at last, as they with many a long look looked over the

<P>wall of Mansoul, they thought that they saw some returning to

<P>the town; and thought again, Who should they be, too?&nbsp; Who

<P>should they be?&nbsp; At last they discerned that they were the

<P>prisoners: but can you imagine how their hearts were

<P>surprised with wonder, specially when they perceived also in

<P>what equipage and with what honour they were sent home.&nbsp; They

<P>went down to the camp in black, but they came back to the

<P>town in white; they went down to the camp in ropes, they came

<P>back in chains of gold; they went down to the camp with their

<P>feet in fetters, but came back with their steps enlarged

<P>under them; they went also to the camp looking for death, but

<P>they came back from thence with assurance of life; they went

<P>down to the camp with heavy hearts, but came back again with

<P>pipe and tabor playing before them.&nbsp; So as soon as they were

<P>come to Eye-gate, the poor and tottering town of Mansoul

<P>adventured to give a shout; and they gave such a shout as

<P>made the captains in the Prince's army leap at the sound

<P>thereof.&nbsp; Alas! for them, poor hearts! who could blame them?

<P>since their dead friends were come to life again; for it was

<P>to them as life from the dead to see the ancients of the town

<P>of Mansoul shine in such splendour.&nbsp; They looked for nothing

<P>but the axe and the block; but, behold, joy and gladness,

<P>comfort and consolation, and such melodious notes attending

<P>them that was sufficient to make a sick man well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, when they came up, they saluted each other with,

<P>'Welcome, welcome! and blessed be he that has spared you!'

<P>They added also, 'We see it is well with you; but how must it

<P>go with the town of Mansoul?&nbsp; And will it go well with the

<P>town of Mansoul?' said they.&nbsp; Then answered them the Recorder

<P>and my Lord Mayor, 'Oh! tidings! glad tidings! good tidings

<P>of good, and of great joy to poor Mansoul!'&nbsp; Then they gave

<P>another shout, that made the earth to ring again.&nbsp; After

<P>this, they inquired yet more particularly how things went in

<P>the camp, and what message they had from Emmanuel to the

<P>town.&nbsp; So they told them all passages that had happened to

<P>them at the camp, and everything that the Prince did to them.

<P>This made Mansoul wonder at the wisdom and grace of the

<P>Prince Emmanuel.&nbsp; Then they told them what they had received

<P>at his hands for the whole town of Mansoul, and the Recorder

<P>delivered it in these words: ' PARDON, PARDON, PARDON for

<P>Mansoul! and this shall Mansoul know to-morrow!'&nbsp; Then he

<P>commanded, and they went and summoned Mansoul to meet

<P>together in the market-place to-morrow, then to hear their

<P>general pardon read.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But who can think what a turn, what a change, what an

<P>alteration this hint of things did make in the countenance of

<P>the town of Mansoul!&nbsp; No man of Mansoul could sleep that

<P>night for joy; in every house there was joy and music,

<P>singing and making merry: telling and hearing of Mansoul's

<P>happiness was then all that Mansoul had to do; and this was

<P>the burden of all their song: 'Oh! more of this at the rising

<P>of the sun! more of this to-morrow!'&nbsp; 'Who thought

<P>yesterday,' would one say, 'that this day would have been

<P>such a day to us?&nbsp; And who thought, that saw our prisoners go

<P>down in irons, that they would have returned in chains of

<P>gold?&nbsp; Yea, they that judged themselves as they went to be

<P>judged of their judge, were by his mouth acquitted, not for

<P>that they were innocent, but of the Prince's mercy, and sent

<P>home with pipe and tabor.&nbsp; But is this the common custom of

<P>princes? Do they use to show such kind of favours to

<P>traitors?&nbsp; No; this is only peculiar to Shaddai, and unto

<P>Emmanuel, his Son!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now morning drew on apace; wherefore the Lord Mayor, the Lord

<P>Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder came down to the market-place at

<P>the time that the Prince had appointed, where the townsfolk

<P>were waiting for them: and when they came, they came in that

<P>attire, and in that glory that the Prince had put them into

<P>the day before, and the street was lightened with their

<P>glory.&nbsp; So the Mayor, Recorder, and my Lord Willbewill drew

<P>down to Mouth-gate, which was at the lower end of the market-

<P>place, because that of old time was the place where they used

<P>to read public matters.&nbsp; Thither, therefore, they came in

<P>their robes, and their tabrets went before them.&nbsp; Now, the

<P>eagerness of the people to know the full of the matter was

<P>great.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the Recorder stood up upon his feet, and, first

<P>beckoning with his hand for silence, he read out with a loud

<P>voice the pardon.&nbsp; But when he came to these words: 'The

<P>Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, pardoning

<P>iniquity, transgressions, and sins, and to them all manner of

<P>sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven,' etc., they could not

<P>forbear leaping for joy.&nbsp; For this you must know, that there

<P>was conjoined herewith every man's name in Mansoul; also the

<P>seals of the pardon made a brave show.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the Recorder had made an end of reading the pardon, the

<P>townsmen ran up upon the walls of the town, and leaped and

<P>skipped thereon for joy, and bowed themselves seven times

<P>with their faces toward Emmanuel's pavilion, and shouted out

<P>aloud for joy, and said, 'Let Emmanuel live for ever!'&nbsp; Then

<P>order was given to the young men in Mansoul that they should

<P>ring the bells for joy.&nbsp; So the bells did ring, and the

<P>people sing, and the music go in every house in Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the Prince had sent home the three prisoners of Mansoul

<P>with joy, and pipe and tabor, he commanded his captains, with

<P>all the field officers and soldiers throughout his army, to

<P>be ready in that morning, that the Recorder should read the

<P>pardon in Mansoul, to do his further pleasure.&nbsp; So the

<P>morning, as I have showed, being come, just as the Recorder

<P>had made an end of reading the pardon, Emmanuel commanded

<P>that all the trumpets in the camp should sound, that the

<P>colours should be displayed, half of them upon Mount

<P>Gracious, and half of them upon Mount Justice.&nbsp; He commanded

<P>also that all the captains should show themselves in all

<P>their harness, and that the soldiers should shout for joy.

<P>Nor was Captain Credence, though in the castle, silent in

<P>such a day; but he, from the top of the hold, showed himself

<P>with sound of trumpet to Mansoul and to the Prince's camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus have I showed you the manner and way that Emmanuel took

<P>to recover the town of Mansoul from under the hand and power

<P>of the tyrant Diabolus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the Prince had completed these, the outward

<P>ceremonies of his joy, he again commanded that his captains

<P>and soldiers should show unto Mansoul some feats of war: so

<P>they presently addressed themselves to this work.&nbsp; But oh!

<P>with what agility, nimbleness, dexterity, and bravery did

<P>these military men discover their skill in feats of war to

<P>the now gazing town of Mansoul!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They marched, they counter-marched; they opened to the right

<P>and left; they divided and subdivided; they closed, they

<P>wheeled, made good their front and rear with their right and

<P>left wings, and twenty things more, with that aptness, and

<P>then were all as the were again, that they took - yea,

<P>ravished, the hearts that were in Mansoul to behold it.&nbsp; But

<P>add to this, the handling of their arms, the managing of

<P>their weapons of war, were marvellously taking to Mansoul and

<P>me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this action was over, the whole town of Mansoul came out

<P>as one man to the Prince in the camp to thank him, and praise

<P>him for his abundant favour, and to beg that it would please

<P>his grace to come unto Mansoul with his men, and there to

<P>take up their quarters for ever: and this they did in most

<P>humble manner, bowing themselves seven times to the ground

<P>before him.&nbsp; Then said he, 'All peace be to you.' So the town

<P>came nigh, and touched with the hand the top of his golden

<P>sceptre; and they said, 'Oh! that the Prince Emmanuel, with

<P>his captains and men of war, would dwell in Mansoul for ever;

<P>and that his battering-rams and slings might be lodged in her

<P>for the use and service of the Prince, and for the help and

<P>strength of Mansoul.&nbsp; For,' said they, 'we have room for

<P>thee, we have room for thy men, we have also room for thy

<P>weapons of war, and a place to make a magazine for thy

<P>carriages.&nbsp; Do it, Emmanuel, and thou shalt be King and

<P>Captain in Mansoul for ever.&nbsp; Yea, govern thou also according

<P>to all the desire of thy soul, and make thou governors and

<P>princes under thee of thy captains and men of war, and we

<P>will become thy servants, and thy laws shall be our

<P>direction.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They added, moreover, and prayed his Majesty to consider

<P>thereof; 'for,' said they, 'if now, after all this grace

<P>bestowed upon us, thy miserable town of Mansoul, thou

<P>shouldest withdraw, thou and thy captains, from us, the town

<P>of Mansoul will die.&nbsp; Yea,' said they, 'our blessed Emmanuel,

<P>if thou shouldest depart from us now, now thou hast done so

<P>much good for us, and showed so much mercy unto us, what will

<P>follow but that our joy will be as if it had not been, and

<P>our enemies will a second time come upon us with more rage

<P>than at the first?&nbsp; Wherefore, we beseech thee, O thou, the

<P>desire of our eyes, and the strength and life of our poor

<P>town, accept of this motion that now we have made unto our

<P>Lord, and come and dwell in the midst of us, and let us be

<P>thy people.&nbsp; Besides, Lord, we do not know but that to this

<P>day many Diabolonians may be yet lurking in the town of

<P>Mansoul, and they will betray us, when thou shalt leave us,

<P>into the hand of Diabolus again; and who knows what designs,

<P>plots, or contrivances have passed betwixt them about these

<P>things already?&nbsp; Loath we are to fall again into his horrible

<P>hands.&nbsp; Wherefore, let it please thee to accept of our palace

<P>for thy place of residence, and of the houses of the best men

<P>in our town for the reception of thy soldiers and their

<P>furniture.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Prince, 'If I come to your town, will you

<P>suffer me further to prosecute that which is in mine heart

<P>against mine enemies and yours? - yea, will you help me in

<P>such undertakings?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They answered, 'We know not what we shall do; we did not

<P>think once that we should have been such traitors to Shaddai

<P>as we have proved to be.&nbsp; What, then, shall we say to our

<P>Lord?&nbsp; Let him put no trust in his saints; let the Prince

<P>dwell in our castle, and make of our town a garrison; let him

<P>set his noble captains and his warlike soldiers over us; yea,

<P>let him conquer us with his love, and overcome us with his

<P>grace, and then surely shall he be but with us, and help us,

<P>as he was and did that morning that our pardon was read unto

<P>us.&nbsp; We shall comply with this our Lord, and with his ways,

<P>and fall in with his word against the mighty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'One word more, and thy servants have done, and in this will

<P>trouble our Lord no more.&nbsp; We know not the depth of the

<P>wisdom of thee, our Prince.&nbsp; Who could have thought, that had

<P>been ruled by his reason, that so much sweet as we do now

<P>enjoy should have come out of those bitter trials wherewith

<P>we were tried at the first!&nbsp; But, Lord, let light go before,

<P>and let love come after: yea, take us by the hand, and lead

<P>us by thy counsels, and let this always abide upon us, that

<P>all things shall be the best for thy servants, and come to

<P>our Mansoul, and do as it pleaseth thee.&nbsp; Or, Lord, come to

<P>our Mansoul, do what thou wilt, so thou keepest us from

<P>sinning, and makest us serviceable to thy Majesty.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Prince to the town of Mansoul again, 'Go,

<P>return to your houses in peace.&nbsp; I will willingly in this

<P>comply with your desires; I will remove my royal pavilion, I

<P>will draw up my forces before Eye-gate to-morrow, and so will

<P>march forwards into the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I will possess

<P>myself of your castle of Mansoul, and will set my soldiers

<P>over you: yea, I will yet do things in Mansoul that cannot be

<P>paralleled in any nation, country, or kingdom under heaven.'

<P>Then did the men of Mansoul give a shout, and returned unto

<P>their houses in peace; they also told to their kindred and

<P>friends the good that Emmanuel had promised to Mansoul.&nbsp; 'And

<P>to-morrow,' said they, 'he will march into our town, and take

<P>up his dwelling, he and his men, in Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then went out the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul with

<P>haste to the green trees and to the meadows, to gather boughs

<P>and flowers, therewith to strew the streets against their

<P>Prince, the Son of Shaddai, should come; they also made

<P>garlands and other fine works to betoken how joyful they

<P>were, and should be to receive their Emmanuel into Mansoul;

<P>yea, they strewed the street quite from Eye-gate to the

<P>castle-gate, the place where the Prince should be.&nbsp; They also

<P>prepared for his coming what music the town of Mansoul would

<P>afford, that they might play before him to the palace, his

<P>habitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, at the time appointed he makes his approach to Mansoul,

<P>and the gates were set open for him; there also the ancients

<P>and elders of Mansoul met him to salute him with a thousand

<P>welcomes.&nbsp; Then he arose and entered Mansoul, he and all his

<P>servants.&nbsp; The elders of Mansoul did also go dancing before

<P>him till he came to the castle gates.&nbsp; And this was the

<P>manner of his going up thither:- He was clad in his golden

<P>armour, he rode in his royal chariot, the trumpets sounded

<P>about him, the colours were displayed, his ten thousands went

<P>up at his feet, and the elders of Mansoul danced before him.

<P>And now were the walls of the famous town of Mansoul filled

<P>with the tramplings of the inhabitants thereof, who went up

<P>thither to view the approach of the blessed Prince and his

<P>royal army.&nbsp; Also the casements, windows, balconies, and tops

<P>of the houses, were all now filled with persons of all sorts,

<P>to behold how their town was to be filled with good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when he was come so far into the town as to the

<P>Recorder's house, he commanded that one should go to Captain

<P>Credence, to know whether the castle of Mansoul was prepared

<P>to entertain his royal presence (for the preparation of that

<P>was left to that captain), and word was brought that it was.

<P>Then was Captain Credence commanded also to come forth with

<P>his power to meet the Prince, the which was, as he had

<P>commanded, done; and he conducted him into the castle.&nbsp; This

<P>done, the Prince that night did lodge in the castle with his

<P>mighty captains and men of war, to the joy of the town of

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the next care of the townsfolk was, how the captains and

<P>soldiers of the Prince's army should be quartered among them;

<P>and the care was not how they should shut their hands of

<P>them, but how they should fill their houses with them; for

<P>every man in Mansoul now had that esteem of Emmanuel and his

<P>men that nothing grieved them more than because they were not

<P>enlarged enough, every one of them to receive the whole army

<P>of the Prince; yea, they counted it their glory to be waiting

<P>upon them, and would, in those days, run at their bidding

<P>like lackeys.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last they came to this result:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. That Captain Innocency should quarter at Mr. Reason's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2. That Captain Patience should quarter at Mr. Mind's.&nbsp; This

<P>Mr. Mind was formerly the Lord Willbewill's clerk in time of

<P>the late rebellion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. It was ordered that Captain Charity should quarter at Mr.

<P>Affection's house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4. That Captain Good-Hope should quarter at my Lord Mayor's.

<P>Now, for the house of the Recorder, himself desired, because

<P>his house was next to the castle, and because from him it was

<P>ordered by the Prince that, if need be, the alarm should be

<P>given to Mansoul, - it was, I say, desired by him that

<P>Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction should take up their

<P>quarters with him, even they and all their men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>5. As for Captain Judgment and Captain Execution, my Lord

<P>Willbewill took them and their men to him, because he was to

<P>rule under the Prince for the good of the town of Mansoul

<P>now, as he had before under the tyrant Diabolus for the hurt

<P>and damage thereof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>6. And throughout the rest of the town were quartered

<P>Emmanuel's forces; but Captain Credence, with his men, abode

<P>still in the castle.&nbsp; So the Prince, his captains, and his

<P>soldiers, were lodged in the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the ancients and elders of the town of Mansoul thought

<P>that they never should have enough of the Prince Emmanuel;

<P>his person, his actions, his words, and behaviour, were so

<P>pleasing, so taking, so desirable to them.&nbsp; Wherefore they

<P>prayed him, that though the castle of Mansoul was his place

<P>of residence, (and they desired that he might dwell there for

<P>ever,) yet that he would often visit the streets, houses, and

<P>people of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'For,' said they, 'dread Sovereign, thy

<P>presence, thy looks, thy smiles, thy words, are the life, and

<P>strength, and sinews of the town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Besides this, they craved that they might have, without

<P>difficulty or interruption, continual access unto him, (so

<P>for that very purpose he commanded that the gates should

<P>stand open,) that they might there see the manner of his

<P>doings, the fortifications of the place, and the royal

<P>mansion-house of the Prince.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he spake, they all stopped their mouths and gave

<P>audience; and when he walked, it was their delight to imitate

<P>him in his goings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, upon a time, Emmanuel made a feast for the town of

<P>Mansoul; and upon the feasting-day the townsfolk were come to

<P>the castle to partake of his banquet; and he feasted them

<P>with all manner of outlandish food; - food that grew not in

<P>the fields of Mansoul; nor in all the whole Kingdom of

<P>Universe; it was food that came from his Father's court.&nbsp; And

<P>so there was dish after dish set before them, and they were

<P>commanded freely to eat.&nbsp; But still, when a fresh dish was

<P>set before them, they would whisperingly say to each other,

<P>'What is it?' for they wist not what to call it.&nbsp; They drank

<P>also of the water that was made wine, and were very merry

<P>with him.&nbsp; There was music also all the while at the table;

<P>and man did eat angels' food, and had honey given him out of

<P>the rock.&nbsp; So Mansoul did eat the food that was peculiar to

<P>the court; yea, they had now thereof to the full.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I must not forget to tell you, that as at this table there

<P>were musicians, so they were not those of the country, nor

<P>yet of the town of Mansoul; but they were the masters of the

<P>songs that were sung at the court of Shaddai.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, after the feast was over, Emmanuel was for entertaining

<P>the town of Mansoul with some curious riddles of secrets

<P>drawn up by his Father's secretary, by the skill and wisdom

<P>of Shaddai; the like to these there is not in any kingdom.

<P>These riddles were made upon the King Shaddai himself, and

<P>upon Emmanuel his Son, and upon his wars and doings with

<P>Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emmanuel also expounded unto them some of those riddles

<P>himself; but, oh! how they were lightened!&nbsp; They saw what

<P>they never saw; they could not have thought that such

<P>rarities could have been couched in so few and such ordinary

<P>words.&nbsp; I told you before, whom these riddles did concern;

<P>and as they were opened, the people did evidently see it was

<P>so.&nbsp; Yea, they did gather that the things themselves were a

<P>kind of a portraiture, and that of Emmanuel himself; for when

<P>they read in the scheme where the riddles were writ, and

<P>looked in the face of the Prince, things looked so like the

<P>one to the other, that Mansoul could not forbear but say,

<P>'This is the lamb! this is the sacrifice! this is the rock!

<P>this is the red cow! this is the door! and this is the way!'

<P>with a great many other things more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And thus he dismissed the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But can you

<P>imagine how the people of the corporation were taken with

<P>this entertainment!&nbsp; Oh! they were transported with joy, they

<P>were drowned with wonderment, while they saw and understood,

<P>and considered what their Emmanuel entertained them withal,

<P>and what mysteries he opened to them.&nbsp; And when they were at

<P>home in their houses, and in their most retired places, they

<P>could not but sing of him and of his actions.&nbsp; Yea, so taken

<P>were the townsmen now with their Prince, that they would sing

<P>of him in their sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, it was in the heart of the Prince Emmanuel to new-model

<P>the town of Mansoul, and to put it into such a condition as

<P>might be most pleasing to him, and that might best stand with

<P>the profit and security of the now flourishing town of

<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; He provided also against insurrections at home, and

<P>invasions from abroad, such love had he for the famous town

<P>of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherefore he first of all commanded that the great slings

<P>that were brought from his Father's court, when he came to

<P>the war of Mansoul, should be mounted, some upon the

<P>battlements of the castle, some upon the towers; for there

<P>were towers in the town of Mansoul, towers, new-built by

<P>Emmanuel since he came hither.&nbsp; There was also an instrument,

<P>invented by Emmanuel, that was to throw stones from the

<P>castle of Mansoul, out at Mouth-gate; an instrument that

<P>could not be resisted, nor that would miss of execution.

<P>Wherefore, for the wonderful exploits that it did when used,

<P>it went without a name; and it was committed to the care of,

<P>and to be managed by the brave captain, the Captain Credence,

<P>in case of war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This done, Emmanuel called the Lord Willbewill to him, and

<P>gave him in commandment to take care of the gates, the wall,

<P>and towers in Mansoul; also the Prince gave him the militia

<P>into his hand, and a special charge to withstand all

<P>insurrections and tumults that might be made in Mansoul

<P>against the peace of our Lord the King, and the peace and

<P>tranquillity of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He also gave him in

<P>commission, that if he found any of the Diabolonians lurking

<P>in any corner of the famous town of Mansoul, he should

<P>forthwith apprehend them, and stay them, or commit them to

<P>safe custody, that they may be proceeded against according to

<P>law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he called unto him the Lord Understanding, who was the

<P>old Lord Mayor, he that was put out of place when Diabolus

<P>took the town, and put him into his former office again, and

<P>it became his place for his lifetime.&nbsp; He bid him also that

<P>he should build him a palace near Eye-gate; and that he

<P>should build it in fashion like a tower for defence.&nbsp; He bid

<P>him also that he should read in the Revelation of Mysteries

<P>all the days of his life, that he might know how to perform

<P>his office aright.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He also made Mr. Knowledge the Recorder, not of contempt to

<P>old Mr. Conscience, who had been Recorder before, but for

<P>that it was in his princely mind to confer upon Mr.

<P>Conscience another employ, of which he told the old gentleman

<P>he should know more hereafter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he commanded that the image of Diabolus should be taken

<P>down from the place where it was set up, and that they should

<P>destroy it utterly, beating it into powder, and casting it

<P>into the wind without the town wall; and that the image of

<P>Shaddai, his Father, should be set up again, with his own,

<P>upon the castle gates; and that it should be more fairly

<P>drawn than ever, forasmuch as both his Father and himself

<P>were come to Mansoul in more grace and mercy than heretofore.

<P>He would also that his name should be fairly engraven upon

<P>the front of the town, and that it should be done in the best

<P>of gold, for the honour of the town of Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this was done, Emmanuel gave out a commandment that

<P>those three great Diabolonians should be apprehended, namely,

<P>the two late Lord Mayors, to wit, Mr. Incredulity, Mr.

<P>Lustings, and Mr. Forget-Good, the Recorder.&nbsp; Besides these,

<P>there were some of them that Diabolus made burgesses and

<P>aldermen in Mansoul, that were committed to ward by the hand

<P>of the now valiant and now right noble, the brave Lord

<P>Willbewill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And these were their names: Alderman Atheism, Alderman Hard-

<P>Heart, and Alderman False-Peace.&nbsp; The burgesses were, Mr. No-

<P>Truth, Mr. Pitiless, Mr. Haughty, with the like.&nbsp; These were

<P>committed to close custody, and the gaoler's name was Mr.

<P>True-Man.&nbsp; This True-Man was one of those that Emmanuel

<P>brought with him from his Father's court when at the first he

<P>made a war upon Diabolus in the town or Mansoul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, the Prince gave a charge that the three

<P>strongholds that, at the command of Diabolus, the

<P>Diabolonians built in Mansoul, should be demolished and

<P>utterly pulled down; of which holds and their names, with

<P>their captains and governors, you read a little before.&nbsp; But

<P>this was long in doing, because of the largeness of the

<P>places, and because the stones, the timber, the iron, and all

<P>rubbish, was to be carried without the town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this was done, the Prince gave order that the Lord Mayor

<P>and aldermen of Mansoul should call a court of judicature for

<P>the trial and execution of the Diabolonians in the

<P>corporation now under the charge of Mr. True-Man, the gaoler.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, when the time was come, and the court set, commandment

<P>was sent to Mr. True-Man, the gaoler, to bring the prisoners

<P>down to the bar.&nbsp; Then were the prisoners brought down,

<P>pinioned and chained together, as the custom of the town of

<P>Mansoul was.&nbsp; So, when they were presented before the Lord

<P>Mayor, the Recorder, and the rest of the honourable bench,

<P>first, the jury was empannelled, and then the witnesses

<P>sworn.&nbsp; The names of the jury were these: Mr. Belief, Mr.

<P>True-Heart, Mr. Upright, Mr. Hate-Bad, Mr. Love-God, Mr. See-

<P>Truth, Mr. Heavenly-Mind, Mr. Moderate, Mr. Thankful, Mr.

<P>Good-Work, Mr. Zeal-for-God, and Mr. Humble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The names of the witnesses were - Mr. Know-All, Mr. Tell-

<P>True, Mr. Hate-Lies, with my Lord Willbewill and his man, if

<P>need were.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the prisoners were set to the bar.&nbsp; Then said Mr. Do-

<P>Right, (for he was the Town-Clerk,) 'Set Atheism to the bar,

<P>gaoler.'&nbsp; So he was set to the bar.&nbsp; Then said the Clerk,

<P>'Atheism, hold up thy hand.&nbsp; Thou art here indicted by the

<P>name of Atheism, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for

<P>that thou hast perniciously and doltishly taught and

<P>maintained that there is no God, and so no heed to be taken

<P>to religion.&nbsp; This thou hast done against the being, honour,

<P>and glory of the King, and against the peace and safety of

<P>the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; What sayest thou?&nbsp; Art thou guilty of

<P>this indictment, or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>ATHEISM.&nbsp; Not guilty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CRIER.&nbsp; Call Mr. Know-All, Mr. Tell-True, and Mr. Hate-Lies

<P>into the court.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So they were called, and they appeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Clerk, 'You, the witnesses for the King, look

<P>upon the prisoner at the bar; do you know him?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Know-All, 'Yes, my lord, we know him; his name

<P>is Atheism; he has been a very pestilent fellow for many

<P>years in the miserable town of Mansoul.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; You are sure you know him?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; Know him!&nbsp; Yes my lord; I have heretofore too often

<P>been in his company to be at this time ignorant of him.&nbsp; He

<P>is a Diabolonian, the son of a Diabolonian: I knew his

<P>grandfather and his father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Well said.&nbsp; He standeth here indicted by the name
of

<P>Atheism, etc., and is charged that he hath maintained and

<P>taught that there is no God, and so no heed need be taken to

<P>any religion.&nbsp; What say you, the King's witnesses, to this?

<P>Is he guilty or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, I and he were once in Villain's Lane

<P>together, and he at that time did briskly talk of divers

<P>opinions; and then and there I heard him say, that, for his

<P>part, he did believe that there was no God.&nbsp; 'But,' said he,

<P>'I can profess one, and be as religious too, if the company I

<P>am in, and the circumstances of other things,' said he,

<P>'shall put me upon it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; You are sure you heard him say thus?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; Upon mine oath, I heard him say thus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Clerk, 'Mr. Tell-True, what say you to the

<P>King's judges touching the prisoner at the bar?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; My lord, I formerly was a great companion of his, for

<P>the which I now repent me, and I have often heard him say,

<P>and that with very great stomachfulness, that he believed

<P>there was neither God, angel, nor spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say so?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; In Blackmouth Lane and in Blasphemer's Row, and in

<P>many other places besides.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Have you much knowledge of him?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; I know him to be a Diabolonian, the son of a

<P>Diabolonian, and a horrible man to deny a Deity.&nbsp; His

<P>father's name was Never-be-good, and he had more children

<P>than this Atheism.&nbsp; I have no more to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Hate-Lies, look upon the prisoner at the bar; do

<P>you know him?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HATE.&nbsp; My lord, this Atheism is one of the vilest wretches

<P>that ever I came near, or had to do with in my life.&nbsp; I have

<P>heard him say that there is no God; I have heard him say that

<P>there is no world to come, no sin, nor punishment hereafter,

<P>and, moreover, I have heard him say that it was as good to go

<P>to a whore-house as to go to hear a sermon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say these things?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HATE.&nbsp; In Drunkard's Row, just at Rascal-Lane's End, at a

<P>house in which Mr. Impiety lived.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Lustings to the bar.

<P>Mr. Lustings, thou art here indicted by the name of Lustings,

<P>(an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou hast

<P>devilishly and traitorously taught, by practice and filthy

<P>words, that it is lawful and profitable to man to give way to

<P>his carnal desires; and that thou, for thy part, hast not,

<P>nor never wilt, deny thyself of any sinful delight as long as

<P>thy name is Lustings.&nbsp; How sayest thou?&nbsp; Art thou guilty of

<P>this indictment, or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Mr. Lustings, 'My lord, I am a man of high birth,

<P>and have been used to pleasures and pastimes of greatness.&nbsp; I

<P>have not been wont to be snubbed for my doings, but have been

<P>left to follow my will as if it were law.&nbsp; And it seems

<P>strange to me that I should this day be called into question

<P>for that, that not only I, but almost all men, do either

<P>secretly or openly countenance, love, and approve of.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Sir, we concern not ourselves with your greatness;

<P>(though the higher, the better you should have been;) but we

<P>are concerned, and so are you now, about an indictment

<P>preferred against you.&nbsp; How say you?&nbsp; Are you guilty of it,

<P>or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>LUST.&nbsp; Not guilty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Crier, call upon the witnesses to stand forth and

<P>give their evidence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CRIER.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you, the witnesses for the King, come in

<P>and give in your evidence for our Lord the King against the

<P>prisoner at the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Know-All, look upon the prisoner at the

<P>bar; do you know him?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; Yes, my lord, I know him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; What is his name?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; His name is Lustings; he was the son of one Beastly,

<P>and his mother bare him in Flesh Street: she was one Evil-

<P>Concupiscence's daughter.&nbsp; I knew all the generation of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Well said.&nbsp; You have heard his indictment; what say

<P>you to it?&nbsp; Is he guilty of the things charged against him,

<P>or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, he has, as he saith, been a great man indeed,

<P>and greater in wickedness than by pedigree more than a

<P>thousandfold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; But what do you know of his particular actions, and

<P>especially with reference to his indictment?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; I know him to be a swearer, a liar, a Sabbath-breaker;

<P>I know him to be a fornicator and an unclean person; I know

<P>him to be guilty of abundance of evils.&nbsp; He has been, to my

<P>knowledge, a very filthy man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; But where did he use to commit his wickedness? in

<P>some private corners, or more open and shamelessly?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>KNOW.&nbsp; All the town over, my lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Tell-True, what have you to say for our

<P>Lord the King against the prisoner at the bar?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TELL.&nbsp; My lord, all that the first witness has said I know to

<P>be true, and a great deal more besides.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Lustings, do you hear what these gentlemen say?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>LUST.&nbsp; I was ever of opinion that the happiest life that a

<P>man could live on earth was to keep himself back from nothing

<P>that he desired in the world; nor have I been false at any

<P>time to this opinion of mine, but have lived in the love of

<P>my notions all my days.&nbsp; Nor was I ever so churlish, having

<P>found such sweetness in them myself, as to keep the

<P>commendations of them from others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Court, 'There hath proceeded enough from his

<P>own mouth to lay him open to condemnation; wherefore, set him

<P>by, gaoler, and set Mr. Incredulity to the bar.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Incredulity set to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Incredulity, thou art here indicted by the name

<P>of Incredulity, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for

<P>that thou hast feloniously and wickedly, and that when thou

<P>wert an officer in the town of Mansoul, made head against the

<P>captains of the great King Shaddai when they came and

<P>demanded possession of Mansoul; yea, thou didst bid defiance

<P>to the name, forces, and cause of the King, and didst also,

<P>as did Diabolus thy captain, stir up and encourage the town

<P>of Mansoul to make head against and resist the said force of

<P>the King.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Art thou

<P>guilty of it, or not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Incredulity, 'I know not Shaddai; I love my old

<P>prince; I thought it my duty to be true to my trust, and to

<P>do what I could to possess the minds of the men of Mansoul to

<P>do their utmost to resist strangers and foreigners, and with

<P>might to fight against them.&nbsp; Nor have I, nor shall I, change

<P>mine opinion for fear of trouble, though you at present are

<P>possessed of place and power.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Court, 'The man, as you see, is incorrigible;

<P>he is for maintaining his villainies by stoutness of words,

<P>and his rebellion with impudent confidence; and therefore set

<P>him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Forget-Good to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Forget-Good set to the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Forget-Good, thou art here indicted by the name

<P>of Forget-Good, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for

<P>that thou, when the whole affairs of the town of Mansoul were

<P>in thy hand, didst utterly forget to serve them in what was

<P>good, and didst fall in with the tyrant Diabolus against

<P>Shaddai the King, against his captains, and all his host, to

<P>the dishonour of Shaddai, the breach of his law, and the

<P>endangering of the destruction of the famous town of Mansoul.

<P>What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Art thou guilty or not

<P>guilty?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Forget-Good: 'Gentlemen, and at this time my

<P>judges, as to the indictment by which I stand of several

<P>crimes accused before you, pray attribute my forgetfulness to

<P>mine age, and not to my wilfulness; to the craziness of my

<P>brain, and not to the carelessness of my mind; and then I

<P>hope I may be by your charity excused from great punishment,

<P>though I be guilty.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Court, 'Forget-Good, Forget-Good, thy

<P>forgetfulness of good was not simply of frailty, but of

<P>purpose, and for that thou didst loathe to keep virtuous

<P>things in thy mind.&nbsp; What was bad thou couldst retain, but

<P>what was good thou couldst not abide to think of; thy age,

<P>therefore, and thy pretended craziness, thou makest use of to

<P>blind the court withal, and as a cloak to cover thy knavery.

<P>But let us hear what the witnesses have to say for the King

<P>against the prisoner at the bar.&nbsp; Is he guilty of this

<P>indictment, or not?'
