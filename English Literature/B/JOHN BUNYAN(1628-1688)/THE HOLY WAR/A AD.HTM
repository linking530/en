<P>SOME say the 'Pilgrim's Progress' is not mine,

<P>Insinuating as if I would shine

<P>In name and fame by the worth of another,

<P>Like some made rich by robbing of their brother.

<P>Or that so fond I am of being sire,

<P>I'll father bastards; or, if need require,

<P>I'll tell a lie in print to get applause.

<P>I scorn it: John such dirt-heap never was,

<P>Since God converted him.&nbsp; Let this suffice

<P>To show why I my 'Pilgrim' patronize.

<P>It came from mine own heart, so to my head,

<P>And thence into my fingers trickled;

<P>Then to my pen, from whence immediately

<P>On paper I did dribble it daintily.

<P>Manner and matter, too, was all mine own,

<P>Nor was it unto any mortal known

<P>Till I had done it; nor did any then

<P>By books, by wits, by tongues, or hand, or pen,

<P>Add five words to it, or write half a line

<P>Thereof: the whole, and every whit is mine.

<P>Also for THIS, thine eye is now upon,

<P>The matter in this manner came from none

<P>But the same heart, and head, fingers, and pen,

<P>As did the other.&nbsp; Witness all good men;

<P>For none in all the world, without a lie,

<P>Can say that this is mine, excepting I

<P>I write not this of my ostentation,

<P>Nor 'cause I seek of men their commendation;

<P>I do it to keep them from such surmise,

<P>As tempt them will my name to scandalize.

<P>Witness my name, if anagram'd to thee,

<P>The letters make - 'Nu hony in a B.'
