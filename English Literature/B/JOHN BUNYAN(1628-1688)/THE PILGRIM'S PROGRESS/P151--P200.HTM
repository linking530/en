<P>&lt;Apollyon casteth to the ground the Christian>

<P>Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began to gather up close

<P>to Christian, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful fall;

<P>and with that Christian's sword flew out of his hand.

<P>Then said Apollyon, I am sure of thee now.&nbsp; And with that

<P>he had almost pressed him to death, so that Christian began

<P>to despair of life; but as God would have it, while Apollyon

<P>was fetching of his last blow, thereby to make a full end

<P>of this good man, Christian nimbly stretched out his hand for his sword,

<P>and caught it, saying, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy;

<P>when I fall I shall arise" [Micah 7:8]; &lt;Christian's victory

<P>over Apollyon> and with that gave him a deadly thrust,

<P>which made him give back, as one that had received his mortal wound.

<P>Christian perceiving that, made at him again, saying, "Nay,

<P>in all these things we are more than conquerors through him

<P>that loved us".&nbsp; [Rom. 8:37]&nbsp; And with that Apollyon spread
forth

<P>his dragon's wings, and sped him away, that Christian for a season

<P>saw him no more.&nbsp; [James 4:7]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{152}

<P>&lt;A brief relation of the combat by the spectator>

<P>In this combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and heard

<P>as I did, what yelling and hideous roaring Apollyon made all the time

<P>of the fight--he spake like a dragon; and, on the other side,

<P>what sighs and groans burst from Christian's heart.&nbsp; I never saw
him

<P>all the while give so much as one pleasant look, till he perceived

<P>he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged sword; then, indeed,

<P>he did smile, and look upward; but it was the dreadfullest sight

<P>that ever I saw.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more unequal match can hardly be,--

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHRISTIAN must fight an Angel; but you see,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The valiant man by handling Sword and Shield,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth make him, tho' a Dragon, quit the field.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{153}

<P>&lt;Christian gives God thanks for deliverance>

<P>So when the battle was over, Christian said, "I will here give thanks

<P>to him that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion,

<P>to him that did help me against Apollyon."&nbsp; And so he did, saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Beelzebub, the captain of this fiend,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design'd my ruin; therefore to this end

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sent him harness'd out:&nbsp; and he with
rage

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hellish was, did fiercely me engage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But blessed Michael helped me, and I,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By dint of sword, did quickly make him fly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore to him let me give lasting praise,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thank and bless his holy name always.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{154}

<P>&lt;Christian goes on his journey with his sword drawn in his hand>

<P>Then there came to him a hand, with some of the leaves

<P>of the tree of life, the which Christian took, and applied to the wounds

<P>that he had received in the battle, and was healed immediately.

<P>He also sat down in that place to eat bread, and to drink of the bottle

<P>that was given him a little before; so, being refreshed,

<P>he addressed himself to his journey, with his sword drawn in his hand;

<P>for he said, I know not but some other enemy may be at hand.&nbsp; But
he met

<P>with no other affront from Apollyon quite through this valley.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{155}

<P>&lt;The Valley of the Shadow of Death>

<P>Now, at the end of this valley was another, called the Valley of

<P>the Shadow of Death, and Christian must needs go through it,

<P>because the way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of it.

<P>Now, this valley is a very solitary place.&nbsp; The prophet Jeremiah

<P>thus describes it:&nbsp; "A wilderness, a land of deserts and of pits,

<P>a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, a land that no man"

<P>(but a Christian) "passed through, and where no man dwelt."&nbsp; [Jer.
2:6]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now here Christian was worse put to it than in his fight with Apollyon,

<P>as by the sequel you shall see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{156}

<P>&lt;The children of the spies go back>

<P>I saw then in my dream, that when Christian was got to the borders of

<P>the Shadow of Death, there met him two men, children of them

<P>that brought up an evil report of the good land [Num. 13],

<P>making haste to go back; to whom Christian spake as follows:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{157}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Whither are you going?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MEN.&nbsp; They said, Back! back! and we would have you to do so too,

<P>if either life or peace is prized by you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, what's the matter? said Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MEN.&nbsp; Matter! said they; we were going that way as you are going,

<P>and went as far as we durst; and indeed we were almost past coming back;

<P>for had we gone a little further, we had not been here to bring the
news

<P>to thee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what have you met with? said Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MEN.&nbsp; Why, we were almost in the Valley of the Shadow of Death;

<P>but that, by good hap, we looked before us, and saw the danger

<P>before we came to it.&nbsp; [Ps. 44:19; 107:10]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what have you seen? said Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{158}

<P>MEN.&nbsp; Seen!&nbsp; Why, the Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch;

<P>we also saw there the hobgoblins, satyrs, and dragons of the pit;

<P>we heard also in that Valley a continual howling and yelling,

<P>as of a people under unutterable misery, who there sat bound

<P>in affliction and irons; and over that Valley hangs

<P>the discouraging clouds of confusion.&nbsp; Death also doth always

<P>spread his wings over it.&nbsp; In a word, it is every whit dreadful,

<P>being utterly without order.&nbsp; [Job 3:5; 10:22]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then, said Christian, I perceive not yet, by what you have
said,

<P>but that this is my way to the desired haven.&nbsp; [Jer. 2:6]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MEN.&nbsp; Be it thy way; we will not choose it for ours.&nbsp; So,
they parted,

<P>and Christian went on his way, but still with his sword

<P>drawn in his hand, for fear lest he should be assaulted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{159}

<P>I saw then in my dream, so far as this valley reached,

<P>there was on the right hand a very deep ditch; that ditch is it

<P>into which the blind have led the blind in all ages, and have both

<P>there miserably perished.&nbsp; [Ps. 69:14,15]&nbsp; Again, behold,

<P>on the left hand, there was a very dangerous quag, into which,

<P>if even a good man falls, he can find no bottom for his foot

<P>to stand on.&nbsp; Into that quag King David once did fall, and had
no doubt

<P>therein been smothered, had not HE that is able plucked him out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{160}

<P>The pathway was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore good Christian

<P>was the more put to it; for when he sought, in the dark,

<P>to shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over

<P>into the mire on the other; also when he sought to escape the mire,

<P>without great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch.

<P>Thus he went on, and I heard him here sigh bitterly; for,

<P>besides the dangers mentioned above, the pathway was here so dark,

<P>and ofttimes, when he lift up his foot to set forward,

<P>he knew not where or upon what he should set it next.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor man! where art thou now? thy day is night.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good man, be not cast down, thou yet art right,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy way to heaven lies by the gates of Hell;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheer up, hold out, with thee it shall go well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{161}

<P>About the midst of this valley, I perceived the mouth of hell to be,

<P>and it stood also hard by the wayside.&nbsp; Now, thought Christian,

<P>what shall I do?&nbsp; And ever and anon the flame and smoke

<P>would come out in such abundance, with sparks and hideous noises,

<P>(things that cared not for Christian's sword, as did Apollyon before),

<P>that he was forced to put up his sword, and betake himself

<P>to another weapon called All-prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Eph. 6:18]&nbsp; So
he cried

<P>in my hearing, "O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul!"&nbsp; [Ps.
116:4]

<P>Thus he went on a great while, yet still the flames would be

<P>reaching towards him.&nbsp; Also he heard doleful voices, and rushings

<P>to and fro, so that sometimes he thought he should be torn in pieces,

<P>or trodden down like mire in the streets.&nbsp; &lt;Christian put to
a stand,

<P>but for a while>&nbsp; This frightful sight was seen, and these

<P>dreadful noises were heard by him for several miles together;

<P>and, coming to a place where he thought he heard a company of fiends

<P>coming forward to meet him, he stopped, and began to muse

<P>what he had best to do.&nbsp; Sometimes he had half a thought to go
back;

<P>then again he thought he might be half way through the valley;

<P>he remembered also how he had already vanquished many a danger,

<P>and that the danger of going back might be much more than for

<P>to go forward; so he resolved to go on.&nbsp; Yet the fiends seemed
to come

<P>nearer and nearer; but when they were come even almost at him,

<P>he cried out with a most vehement voice, "I will walk in the strength

<P>of the Lord God!" so they gave back, and came no further.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{162}

<P>&lt;Christian made believe that he spake blasphemies,

<P>when it was Satan that suggested them into his mind>

<P>One thing I would not let slip.&nbsp; I took notice that now poor Christian

<P>was so confounded, that he did not know his own voice;

<P>and thus I perceived it.&nbsp; Just when he was come over against

<P>the mouth of the burning pit, one of the wicked ones got behind him,

<P>and stepped up softly to him, and whisperingly suggested

<P>many grievous blasphemies to him, which he verily thought

<P>had proceeded from his own mind.&nbsp; This put Christian more to it

<P>than anything that he met with before, even to think that he should
now

<P>blaspheme him that he loved so much before; yet, if he could

<P>have helped it, he would not have done it; but he had not the discretion

<P>either to stop his ears, or to know from whence these blasphemies came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{163}

<P>When Christian had travelled in this disconsolate condition

<P>some considerable time, he thought he heard the voice of a man,

<P>as going before him, saying, "Though I walk through the valley

<P>of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."

<P>[Ps. 23:4]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{164}

<P>Then he was glad, and that for these reasons:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>First, Because he gathered from thence, that some who feared God

<P>were in this valley as well as himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Secondly, For that he perceived God was with them, though in that

<P>dark and dismal state; and why not, thought he, with me? though,

<P>by reason of the impediment that attends this place,

<P>I cannot perceive it.&nbsp; [Job 9:11]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thirdly, For that he hoped, could he overtake them, to have company

<P>by and by.&nbsp; So he went on, and called to him that was before;

<P>but he knew not what to answer; for that he also thought to be alone.

<P>And by and by the day broke; then said Christian,

<P>He hath turned "the shadow of death into the morning".&nbsp; [Amos 5:8]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{165}

<P>&lt;Christian glad at break of day>

<P>Now morning being come, he looked back, not out of desire to return,

<P>but to see, by the light of the day, what hazards he had gone through

<P>in the dark.&nbsp; So he saw more perfectly the ditch that was on

<P>the one hand, and the mire that was on the other; also how narrow

<P>the way was which led betwixt them both; also now he saw the hobgoblins,

<P>and satyrs, and dragons of the pit, but all afar off,

<P>(for after break of day, they came not nigh;) yet they were discovered

<P>to him, according to that which is written, "He discovereth deep things

<P>out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death."

<P>[Job 12:22]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{166}

<P>&lt;The second part of this valley very dangerous>

<P>Now was Christian much affected with his deliverance from

<P>all the dangers of his solitary way; which dangers,

<P>though he feared them more before, yet he saw them more clearly now,

<P>because the light of the day made them conspicuous to him.

<P>And about this time the sun was rising, and this was another mercy

<P>to Christian; for you must note, that though the first part

<P>of the Valley of the Shadow of Death was dangerous,

<P>yet this second part which he was yet to go, was, if possible,

<P>far more dangerous; for from the place where he now stood,

<P>even to the end of the valley, the way was all along set so full

<P>of snares, traps, gins, and nets here, and so full of pits, pitfalls,

<P>deep holes, and shelvings down there, that, had it now been dark,

<P>as it was when he came the first part of the way,

<P>had he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been cast away;

<P>but, as I said just now, the sun was rising.&nbsp; Then said he,

<P>"His candle shineth upon my head, and by his light I walk

<P>through darkness."&nbsp; [Job 29:3]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{167}

<P>In this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley.

<P>Now I saw in my dream, that at the end of this valley lay blood,

<P>bones, ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of pilgrims

<P>that had gone this way formerly; and while I was musing

<P>what should be the reason, I espied a little before me a cave,

<P>where two giants, POPE and PAGAN, dwelt in old time;

<P>by whose power and tyranny the men whose bones, blood, and ashes, &amp;c.,

<P>lay there, were cruelly put to death.&nbsp; But by this place

<P>Christian went without much danger, whereat I somewhat wondered;

<P>but I have learnt since, that PAGAN has been dead many a day;

<P>and as for the other, though he be yet alive, he is, by reason of age,

<P>and also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with

<P>in his younger days, grown so crazy and stiff in his joints,

<P>that he can now do little more than sit in his cave's mouth,

<P>grinning at pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails

<P>because he cannot come at them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{168}

<P>So I saw that Christian went on his way; yet, at the sight

<P>of the Old Man that sat in the mouth of the cave, he could not tell

<P>what to think, especially because he spake to him, though he could not

<P>go after him, saying, "You will never mend till more of you be burned."

<P>But he held his peace, and set a good face on it, and so went by

<P>and catched no hurt.&nbsp; Then sang Christian:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O world of wonders! (I can say no less),

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should be preserved in that distress

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have met with here!&nbsp; O blessed
be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hand that from it hath deliver'd me!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dangers in darkness, devils, hell, and sin

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did compass me, while I this vale was in:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, snares, and pits, and traps, and nets,
did lie

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My path about, that worthless, silly I

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might have been catch'd, entangled, and cast
down;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But since I live, let JESUS wear the crown.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{169}

<P>Now, as Christian went on his way, he came to a little ascent,

<P>which was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before them.

<P>Up there, therefore, Christian went, and looking forward, he saw

<P>Faithful before him, upon his journey.&nbsp; Then said Christian aloud,

<P>"Ho! ho! So-ho! stay, and I will be your companion!"&nbsp; At that,

<P>Faithful looked behind him; to whom Christian cried again, "Stay, stay,

<P>till I come up to you!"&nbsp; But Faithful answered, "No, I am upon
my life,

<P>and the avenger of blood is behind me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{170}

<P>&lt;Christian overtakes Faithful>

<P>At this, Christian was somewhat moved, and putting to all his strength,

<P>he quickly got up with Faithful, and did also overrun him;

<P>so the last was first.&nbsp; Then did Christian vain-gloriously smile,

<P>because he had gotten the start of his brother; but not taking

<P>good heed to his feet, he suddenly stumbled and fell,

<P>and could not rise again until Faithful came up to help him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Christian's fall makes Faithful and he go lovingly together>

<P>Then I saw in my dream they went very lovingly on together,

<P>and had sweet discourse of all things that had happened to them

<P>in their pilgrimage; and thus Christian began:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{171}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; My honoured and well-beloved brother, Faithful, I am glad

<P>that I have overtaken you; and that God has so tempered our spirits,

<P>that we can walk as companions in this so pleasant a path.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I had thought, dear friend, to have had your company

<P>quite from our town; but you did get the start of me,

<P>wherefore I was forced to come thus much of the way alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; How long did you stay in the City of Destruction before

<P>you set out after me on your pilgrimage?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Their talk about the country from whence they came>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Till I could stay no longer; for there was great talk

<P>presently after you were gone out that our city would, in short time,

<P>with fire from heaven, be burned down to the ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; What! did your neighbours talk so?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, it was for a while in everybody's mouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; What! and did no more of them but you come out

<P>to escape the danger?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Though there was, as I said, a great talk thereabout,

<P>yet I do not think they did firmly believe it.&nbsp; For in the heat

<P>of the discourse, I heard some of them deridingly speak of you and of

<P>your desperate journey, (for so they called this your pilgrimage),

<P>but I did believe, and do still, that the end of our city

<P>will be with fire and and brimstone from above; and therefore

<P>I have made my escape.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{172}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Did you hear no talk of neighbour Pliable?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, Christian, I heard that he followed you till he came

<P>at the Slough of Despond, where, as some said, he fell in;

<P>but he would not be known to have so done; but I am sure

<P>he was soundly bedabbled with that kind of dirt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what said the neighbours to him?
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;How Pliable was accounted of, when he got home>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; He hath, since his going back, been had greatly in derision,

<P>and that among all sorts of people; some do mock and despise him;

<P>and scarce will any set him on work.&nbsp; He is now seven times worse

<P>than if he had never gone out of the city.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But why should they be so set against him, since they also
despise

<P>the way that he forsook?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Oh, they say, hang him, he is a turncoat! he was not true

<P>to his profession.&nbsp; I think God has stirred up even his enemies
to

<P>hiss at him, and make him a proverb, because he hath forsaken the way.

<P>[Jer. 29:18,19]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Had you no talk with him before you came out?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I met him once in the streets, but he leered away on

<P>the other side, as one ashamed of what he had done;

<P>so I spake not to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{173}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, at my first setting out, I had hopes of that man;

<P>but now I fear he will perish in the overthrow of the city;

<P>to her wallowing in the mire."&nbsp; [2 Pet. 2:22]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; These are my fears of him too; but who can hinder

<P>that which will be?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, neighbour Faithful, said Christian, let us leave him,

<P>&lt;He is assaulted by Adam the First>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; When I came to the foot of the hill called Difficulty,

<P>I met with a very aged man, who asked me what I was, and whither bound.

<P>I told him that I am a pilgrim, going to the Celestial City.

<P>Then said the old man, Thou lookest like an honest fellow;

<P>wilt thou be content to dwell with me for the wages that I shall

<P>give thee?&nbsp; Then I asked him his name, and where he dwelt.

<P>He said his name was Adam the First, and that he dwelt in the town

<P>of Deceit.&nbsp; [Eph. 4:22]&nbsp; I asked him then what was his work,

<P>and what the wages he would give.&nbsp; He told me that his work

<P>was many delights; and his wages that I should be his heir at last.

<P>I further asked him what house he kept, and what other servants he had.

<P>So he told me that his house was maintained with all the dainties

<P>in the world; and that his servants were those of his own begetting.

<P>Then I asked if he had any children.&nbsp; He said that he had

<P>but three daughters:&nbsp; The Lust of the Flesh, The Lust of the Eyes,

<P>and The Pride of Life, and that I should marry them all if I would.

<P>[1 John 2:16]&nbsp; Then I asked how long time he would have me

<P>live with him?&nbsp; And he told me, As long as he lived himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, and what conclusion came the old man and you to at
last?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Why, at first, I found myself somewhat inclinable

<P>to go with the man, for I thought he spake very fair;

<P>"Put off the old man with his deeds."

<P>{176}

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Then it came burning hot into my mind, whatever he said,

<P>and however he flattered, when he got me home to his house,

<P>he would sell me for a slave.&nbsp; So I bid him forbear to talk,

<P>for I would not come near the door of his house.&nbsp; Then he reviled
me,

<P>and told me that he would send such a one after me, that should make

<P>my way bitter to my soul.&nbsp; So I turned to go away from him;

<P>but just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold

<P>of my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought

<P>he had pulled part of me after himself.&nbsp; This made me cry,

<P>"O wretched man!"&nbsp; [Rom. 7:24] So I went on my way up the hill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now when I had got about half-way up, I looked behind,

<P>and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me

<P>just about the place where the settle stands.

<P>I asked him wherefore he served me so.&nbsp; He said, because of

<P>my secret inclining to Adam the First; and with that he struck me

<P>another deadly blow on the breast, and beat me down backward; so I lay

<P>at his foot as dead as before.&nbsp; So, when I came to myself again,

<P>I cried him mercy; but he said, I know not how to show mercy;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; He told me, indeed, that he saw you go by, but I wish

<P>for that the valley was altogether without honour.&nbsp; He told me,

<P>moreover, that there to go was the way to disobey all my friends,

claim

<P>kindred of me, and that rightly, for indeed they were my relations

<P>according to the flesh; yet since I became a pilgrim,

<P>they have disowned me, as I also have rejected them; and therefore

<P>they were to me now no more than if they had never been of my lineage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I told him, moreover, that as to this valley, he had quite

<P>misrepresented the thing; for before honour is humility,

<P>and a haughty spirit before a fall.&nbsp; Therefore, said I,

<P>I had rather go through this valley to the honour that was so accounted

<P>in my pilgrimage, he, I think, bears the wrong name.

<P>The others would be said nay, after a little argumentation,

<P>and somewhat else; but this bold-faced Shame would never have done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, what did he say to you?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; What! why, he objected against religion itself;

<P>he said it was a pitiful, low, sneaking business for a man

<P>to mind religion; he said that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing;

<P>and that for a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to

<P>tie up himself from that hectoring liberty that the brave spirits

<P>of the times accustom themselves unto, would make him the ridicule

<P>of the times.&nbsp; He objected also, that but few of the mighty, rich,

<P>or wise, were ever of my opinion [1 Cor. 1:26; 3:18; Phil. 3:7,8];

<P>nor any of them neither [John 7:48], before they were persuaded

<P>to be fools, and to be of a voluntary fondness, to venture

<P>the loss of all, for nobody knows what.&nbsp; He, moreover,

<P>objected the base and low estate and condition of those

<P>that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times in which they lived:

<P>also their ignorance and want of understanding in all natural science.

<P>Yea, he did hold me to it at that rate also, about a great many

<P>more things than here I relate; as, that it was a shame to sit

<P>whining and mourning under a sermon, and a shame to come

<P>sighing and groaning home:&nbsp; that it was a shame to ask my neighbour

<P>forgiveness for petty faults, or to make restitution

<P>where I have taken from any.&nbsp; He said, also, that religion made
a man

<P>grow strange to the great, because of a few vices, which he called

<P>by finer names; and made him own and respect the base,

<P>because of the same religious fraternity.&nbsp; And is not this, said
he,

<P>a shame?

<P>{182}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what did you say to him?

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Say! I could not tell what to say at the first.

<P>Yea, he put me so to it, that my blood came up in my face;

<P>even this Shame fetched it up, and had almost beat me quite off.

<P>But at last I began to consider, that "that which is highly esteemed

<P>among men, is had in abomination with God."&nbsp; [Luke 16:15]

<P>And I thought again, this Shame tells me what men are;

<P>but it tells me nothing what God or the Word of God is.

<P>And I thought, moreover, that at the day of doom, we shall not be doomed

<P>to death or life according to the hectoring spirits of the world,

<P>but according to the wisdom and law of the Highest.&nbsp; Therefore,

<P>thought I, what God says is best, indeed is best, though all the men

<P>in the world are against it.&nbsp; Seeing, then, that God prefers

<P>his religion; seeing God prefers a tender conscience;

<P>seeing they that make themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven

<P>are wisest; and that the poor man that loveth Christ is richer

<P>than the greatest man in the world that hates him; Shame, depart,

<P>thou art an enemy to my salvation!&nbsp; Shall I entertain thee

<P>against my sovereign Lord?&nbsp; How then shall I look him in the face

<P>at his coming?&nbsp; Should I now be ashamed of his ways and servants,

<P>how can I expect the blessing? [Mark 8:38]&nbsp; But, indeed,

<P>this Shame was a bold villain; I could scarce shake him

<P>out of my company; yea, he would be haunting of me, and continually

<P>whispering me in the ear, with some one or other of the infirmities

<P>that attend religion; but at last I told him it was but in vain

<P>to attempt further in this business; for those things that he disdained,

<P>in those did I see most glory; and so at last I got past

<P>this importunate one.&nbsp; And when I had shaken him off,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That now, or sometime else, we by them may

<P>to put us to shame before all men:&nbsp; that is, to make us ashamed

<P>of that which is good; but if he was not himself audacious,

<P>he would never attempt to do as he does.&nbsp; But let us still resist
him;

<P>he would have killed me, especially when he got me down

<P>and crushed me under him, as if he would have crushed me to pieces;

<P>for as he threw me, my sword flew out of my hand; nay, he told me

<P>he was sure of me:&nbsp; but I cried to God, and he heard me,

<P>and delivered me out of all my troubles.&nbsp; Then I entered into

<P>the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and had no light for almost

<P>half the way through it.&nbsp; I thought I should have been killed there,

<P>&lt;Talkative's dislike of bad discourse>

<P>TALK.&nbsp; To talk of things that are good, to me is very acceptable,

<P>with you or with any other; and I am glad that I have met with

<P>those that incline to so good a work; for, to speak the truth,

<P>there are but few that care thus to spend their time,

<P>(as they are in their travels), but choose much rather to be

<P>speaking of things to no profit; and this hath been a trouble for me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; That is indeed a thing to be lamented; for what things

<P>so worthy of the use of the tongue and mouth of men on earth

<P>as are the things of the God of heaven?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; I like you wonderful well, for your sayings are full

<P>of conviction; and I will add, what thing is so pleasant,

<P>and what so profitable, as to talk of the things of God?

<P>What things so pleasant (that is, if a man hath any delight in things

<P>that are wonderful)?&nbsp; For instance, if a man doth delight to talk

<P>of the history or the mystery of things; or if a man doth love to talk

<P>of miracles, wonders, or signs, where shall he find things recorded

<P>so delightful, and so sweetly penned, as in the Holy Scripture?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{187}

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; That is true; but to be profited by such things in our
talk

<P>should be that which we design.

<P>&lt;Talkative's fine discourse>

<P>TALK.&nbsp; That is it that I said; for to talk of such things

<P>is most profitable; for by so doing, a man may get knowledge

<P>of many things; as of the vanity of earthly things, and the benefit

<P>of things above.&nbsp; Thus, in general, but more particularly by this,

<P>a man may learn the necessity of the new birth, the insufficiency

<P>of our works, the need of Christ's righteousness, &amp;c.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>by this a man may learn, by talk, what it is to repent, to believe,

<P>to pray, to suffer, or the like; by this also a man may learn

<P>what are the great promises and consolations of the gospel,

<P>to his own comfort.&nbsp; Further, by this a man may learn

<P>to refute false opinions, to vindicate the truth, and also

<P>to instruct the ignorant.

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; All this is true, and glad am I to hear these things from
you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Alas! the want of this is the cause why so few understand

<P>the need of faith, and the necessity of a work of grace in their soul,

<P>in order to eternal life; but ignorantly live in the works of the law,

<P>by which a man can by no means obtain the kingdom of heaven.

<P>when he is on the ale-bench; and the more drink he hath in his crown,

<P>the more of these things he hath in his mouth; religion hath no place

<P>&lt;Talkative talks, but does not>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Deceived! you may be sure of it; remember the proverb,

<P>"They say and do not."&nbsp; [Matt. 23:3]&nbsp; But the kingdom of God

<P>is not in word, but in Power.&nbsp; [1 Cor 4:20]&nbsp; He talketh of
prayer,

<P>of repentance, of faith, and of the new birth; but he knows but only

<P>to talk of them.&nbsp; I have been in his family, and have observed
him

<P>both at home and abroad; and I know what I say of him is the truth.

<P>&lt;His house is empty of religion>&nbsp; His house is as empty of religion

<P>as the white of an egg is of savour.&nbsp; There is there neither prayer

<P>nor sign of repentance for sin; yea, the brute in his kind serves God

<P>far better than he.&nbsp; &lt;He is a stain to religion>&nbsp; He is
the very stain,

<P>reproach, and shame of religion, to all that know him; it can hardly

<P>have a good word in all that end of the town where he dwells,

<P>through him.&nbsp; [Rom. 2:24,25]&nbsp; &lt;The Proverb that goes of
him>

<P>Thus say the common people that know him, A saint abroad,

<P>and a devil at home.&nbsp; His poor family finds it so; he is such a
churl,

<P>such a railer at and so unreasonable with his servants,

<P>that they neither know how to do for or speak to him.

<P>&lt;Men shun to deal with him>&nbsp; Men that have any dealings with
him say

<P>it is better to deal with a Turk than with him; for fairer dealing

<P>they shall have at their hands.&nbsp; This Talkative (if it be possible)

<P>will go beyond them, defraud, beguile, and overreach them.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>he brings up his sons to follow his steps; and if he findeth

<P>in any of them a foolish timorousness, (for so he calls

<P>the first appearance of a tender conscience,) he calls them

<P>fools and blockheads, and by no means will employ them in much,

<P>or speak to their commendations before others.&nbsp; For my part,

<P>I am of opinion, that he has, by his wicked life, caused many

<P>to stumble and fall; and will be, if God prevent not,

<P>the ruin of many more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{194}

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, my brother, I am bound to believe you; not only because

<P>you say you know him, but also because, like a Christian,

<P>you make your reports of men.&nbsp; For I cannot think that you

<P>speak these things of ill-will, but because it is even so as you say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Had I known him no more than you, I might perhaps

<P>have thought of him, as, at the first, you did; yea, had he received

<P>this report at their hands only that are enemies to religion,

<P>I should have thought it had been a slander,--a lot that often falls

<P>from bad men's mouths upon good men's names and professions;

<P>but all these things, yea, and a great many more as bad,

<P>of my own knowledge, I can prove him guilty of.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>good men are ashamed of him; they can neither call him brother,

<P>nor friend; the very naming of him among them makes them blush,

<P>if they know him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{195}

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, I see that saying and doing are two things,

<P>and hereafter I shall better observe this distinction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The carcass of religion>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; They are two things, indeed, and are as diverse as are

<P>the soul and the body; for as the body without the soul is but

<P>a dead carcass, so saying, if it be alone, is but a dead carcass also.

<P>The soul of religion is the practical part:&nbsp; "Pure religion

<P>and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To visit

<P>the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself

<P>unspotted from the world."&nbsp; [James 1:27; see vv. 22-26]

<P>This Talkative is not aware of; he thinks that hearing and saying

<P>will make a good Christian, and thus he deceiveth his own soul.

<P>Hearing is but as the sowing of the seed; talking is not sufficient

<P>to prove that fruit is indeed in the heart and life; and let us

<P>assure ourselves, that at the day of doom men shall be judged

<P>according to their fruits.&nbsp; [Matt. 13, 25]&nbsp; It will not be
said then,

<P>Did you believe? but, Were you doers, or talkers only?

<P>and accordingly shall they be judged.&nbsp; The end of the world

<P>is compared to our harvest; and you know men at harvest

<P>regard nothing but fruit.&nbsp; Not that anything can be accepted

<P>that is not of faith, but I speak this to show you how insignificant

<P>the profession of Talkative will be at that day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{196}

<P>&lt;Faithful convinced of the badness of Talkative>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; This brings to my mind that of Moses, by which he describeth

<P>the beast that is clean.&nbsp; [Lev. 11:3-7; Deut. 14:6-8]&nbsp; He
is such a one

<P>that parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud; not that parteth

<P>the hoof only, or that cheweth the cud only.&nbsp; The hare cheweth
the cud,

<P>but yet is unclean, because he parteth not the hoof.

<P>And this truly resembleth Talkative; he cheweth the cud,

<P>he seeketh knowledge, he cheweth upon the word; but he divideth not

<P>the hoof, he parteth not with the way of sinners; but, as the hare,

<P>he retaineth the foot of a dog or bear, and therefore he is unclean.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Talkative like to things that sound without life>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; You have spoken, for aught I know, the true gospel sense

<P>of those texts.&nbsp; And I will add another thing:&nbsp; Paul calleth
some men,

<P>yea, and those great talkers, too, sounding brass and tinkling cymbals;

<P>that is, as he expounds them in another place, things without life,

<P>giving sound.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 13:1-3; 14:7]&nbsp; Things without life,
that is,

<P>without the true faith and grace of the gospel; and consequently,

<P>things that shall never be placed in the kingdom of heaven

<P>among those that are the children of life; though their sound,

<P>by their talk, be as if it were the tongue or voice of an angel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, I was not so fond of his company at first,

<P>but I am as sick of it now.&nbsp; What shall we do to be rid of him?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Take my advice, and do as I bid you, and you shall find

<P>that he will soon be sick of your company too, except God

<P>shall touch his heart, and turn it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; What would you have me to do?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, go to him, and enter into some serious discourse

<P>about the power of religion; and ask him plainly

<P>(when he has approved of it, for that he will) whether this thing

<P>be set up in his heart, house, or conversation.

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Then Faithful stepped forward again, and said to Talkative,

<P>Come, what cheer?&nbsp; How is it now?

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Thank you, well.&nbsp; I thought we should have had

<P>a great deal of talk by this time.

<P>{198}

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, if you will, we will fall to it now; and since

<P>you left it with me to state the question, let it be this:

<P>How doth the saving grace of God discover itself when it is in

<P>the heart of man?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Talkative's false discovery of a work of grace>

<P>TALK.&nbsp; I perceive, then, that our talk must be about the power

<P>of things.&nbsp; Well, it is a very good question, and I shall be willing

<P>to answer you.&nbsp; And take my answer in brief, thus:&nbsp; First,

<P>Where the grace of God is in the heart, it causeth there

<P>a great outcry against sin.&nbsp; Secondly ----
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Nay, hold, let us consider of one at once.&nbsp; I think
you should

<P>rather say, It shows itself by inclining the soul to abhor its sin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Why, what difference is there between crying out against,

<P>and abhorring of sin?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{199}

<P>&lt;To cry out against sin, no sign of grace>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Oh, a great deal.&nbsp; A man may cry out against sin of
policy,

<P>but he cannot abhor it, but by virtue of a godly antipathy against it.

<P>I have heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit,

<P>who yet can abide it well enough in the heart, house, and conversation.

<P>Joseph's mistress cried out with a loud voice, as if she had been

<P>very holy; but she would willingly, notwithstanding that,

<P>have committed uncleanness with him.&nbsp; Some cry out against sin

<P>even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap,

<P>when she calleth it slut and naughty girl, and then falls

<P>to hugging and kissing it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; You lie at the catch, I perceive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{200}

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; No, not I; I am only for setting things right.

<P>But what is the second thing whereby you would prove a discovery

<P>of a work of grace in the heart?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Great knowledge of gospel mysteries.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Great knowledge no sign of grace>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; This sign should have been first; but first or last,

<P>it is also false; for knowledge, great knowledge, may be obtained

<P>in the mysteries of the gospel, and yet no work of grace in the soul.

<P>[1 Cor. 13]&nbsp; Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be nothing,

<P>and so consequently be no child of God.&nbsp; When Christ said,

<P>"Do you know all these things?" and the disciples had answered, Yes;

<P>he addeth, "Blessed are ye if ye do them."&nbsp; He doth not lay the
blessing

<P>in the knowing of them, but in the doing of them.&nbsp; For there is

<P>a knowledge that is not attended with doing:&nbsp; He that knoweth

<P>his masters will, and doeth it not.&nbsp; A man may know like an angel,

<P>and yet be no Christian, therefore your sign of it is not true.

<P>Indeed, to know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters,

<P>but to do is that which pleaseth God.&nbsp; Not that the heart can be
good

<P>without knowledge; for without that, the heart is naught.

<P>&lt;Knowledge and knowledge>&nbsp; There is, therefore, knowledge and
knowledge.

<P>Knowledge that resteth in the bare speculation of things;

<P>and knowledge that is accompanied with the grace of faith and love;

<P>which puts a man upon doing even the will of God from the heart:

<P>the first of these will serve the talker; but without the other

<P>the true Christian is not content.&nbsp; &lt;True knowledge attended

<P>with endeavors>&nbsp; "Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law;

<P>yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart."&nbsp; [Ps. 119:34]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; You lie at the catch again; this is not for edification.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, if you please, propound another sign how

<P>this work of grace discovereth itself where it is.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Not I, for I see we shall not agree.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, if you will not, will you give me leave to do it?
