<P>But I replied, Lord, I am a great, a very great sinner.

<P>And he answered, "My grace is sufficient for thee."&nbsp; [2 Cor.12:9]

<P>Then I said, But, Lord, what is believing?&nbsp; And then I saw

<P>from that saying, "He that cometh to me shall never hunger,

<P>and he that believeth on me shall never thirst", that believing

<P>and coming was all one; and that he that came, that is,

<P>ran out in his heart and affections after salvation by Christ,

<P>he indeed believed in Christ.&nbsp; [John 6:35]&nbsp; Then the water

<P>stood in mine eyes, and I asked further.&nbsp; But, Lord,

<P>may such a great sinner as I am be indeed accepted of thee,

<P>and be saved by thee?&nbsp; And I heard him say, "And him that cometh
to me,

<P>I will in no wise cast out."&nbsp; [John 6:37]&nbsp; Then I said, But
how, Lord,

<P>must I consider of thee in my coming to thee, that my faith may be

<P>placed aright upon thee?&nbsp; Then he said, "Christ Jesus came

<P>into the world to save sinners."&nbsp; [1 Tim. 1:15]&nbsp; "He is the
end

<P>of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."&nbsp; [Rom.
10:4]

<P>"He died for our sins, and rose again for our justification."

<P>[Rom. 4:25]&nbsp; "He loved us, and washed us from our sins

<P>in his own blood."&nbsp; [Rev. 1:5]&nbsp; "He is mediator betwixt God
and us."

<P>[1 Tim. 2:5]&nbsp; "He ever liveth to make intercession for us."

<P>[Heb. 7:24,25]&nbsp; From all which I gathered, that I must

<P>look for righteousness in his person, and for satisfaction for my sins

<P>by his blood; that what he did in obedience to his Father's law,

<P>and in submitting to the penalty thereof, was not for himself,

<P>but for him that will accept it for his salvation, and be thankful.

<P>And now was my heart full of joy, mine eyes full of tears,

<P>and mine affections running over with love to the name, people,

<P>and ways of Jesus Christ.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{352}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; This was a revelation of Christ to your soul indeed;

<P>but tell me particularly what effect this had upon your spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; It made me see that all the world, notwithstanding all

<P>the righteousness thereof, is in a state of condemnation.

<P>It made me see that God the Father, though he be just,

<P>can justly justify the coming sinner.&nbsp; It made me greatly ashamed

<P>of the vileness of my former life, and confounded me with the sense

<P>of mine own ignorance; for there never came thought into my heart

<P>before now that showed me so the beauty of Jesus Christ.

<P>It made me love a holy life, and long to do something for

<P>the honour and glory of the name of the Lord Jesus; yea,

<P>I thought that had I now a thousand gallons of blood in my body,

<P>I could spill it all for the sake of the Lord Jesus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{353}

<P>I saw then in my dream that Hopeful looked back and saw Ignorance,

<P>whom they had left behind, coming after.&nbsp; Look, said he to Christian,

<P>how far yonder youngster loitereth behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ay, ay, I see him; he careth not for our company.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But I trow it would not have hurt him had he

<P>kept pace with us hitherto.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is true; but I warrant you he thinketh otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; That, I think, he doth; but, however, let us tarry for him.

<P>So they did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{354}

<P>&lt;Young Ignorance comes up again; their talk>

<P>Then Christian said to him, Come away, man, why do you stay so behind?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I take my pleasure in walking alone, even more a great
deal

<P>than in company, unless I like it the better.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Christian to Hopeful, (but softly), Did I not tell you

<P>he cared not for our company?&nbsp; But, however, said he, come up,

<P>and let us talk away the time in this solitary place.

<P>Then directing his speech to Ignorance, he said, Come, how do you?

<P>How stands it between God and your soul now?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{355}

<P>&lt;Ignorance's hope, and the ground of it>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I hope well; for I am always full of good motions,

<P>that come into my mind, to comfort me as I walk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; What good motions? pray, tell us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Why, I think of God and heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; So do the devils and damned souls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But I think of them and desire them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; So do many that are never like to come there.

<P>"The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing."&nbsp; [Prov.
13:4]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But I think of them, and leave all for them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; That I doubt; for leaving all is a hard matter:&nbsp; yea,

<P>a harder matter than many are aware of.&nbsp; But why, or by what,

<P>art thou persuaded that thou hast left all for God and heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{356}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; My heart tells me so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; The wise man says, "He that trusts his own heart is a fool."

<P>[Prov. 28:26]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; This is spoken of an evil heart, but mine is a good one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But how dost thou prove that?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; It comforts me in hopes of heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; That may be through its deceitfulness; for a man's heart

<P>may minister comfort to him in the hopes of that thing for which

<P>he yet has no ground to hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But my heart and life agree together, and therefore

<P>my hope is well grounded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Who told thee that thy heart and life agree together?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; My heart tells me so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ask my fellow if I be a thief! Thy heart tells thee so!

<P>Except the Word of God beareth witness in this matter,

<P>other testimony is of no value.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{357}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But is it not a good heart that hath good thoughts?

<P>and is not that a good life that is according to God's commandments?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, that is a good heart that hath good thoughts,

<P>and that is a good life that is according to God's commandments;

<P>but it is one thing, indeed, to have these, and another thing

<P>only to think so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Pray, what count you good thoughts, and a life according

<P>to God's commandments?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; There are good thoughts of divers kinds; some respecting

<P>ourselves, some God, some Christ, and some other things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;What are good thoughts>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Such as agree with the Word of God.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{358}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of
God?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves

<P>which the Word passes.&nbsp; To explain myself--the Word of God

<P>saith of persons in a natural condition, "There is none righteous,

<P>there is none that doeth good."&nbsp; [Rom. 3]&nbsp; It saith also,

<P>that "every imagination of the heart of man is only evil,

<P>and that continually."&nbsp; [Gen. 6:5]&nbsp; And again, "The imagination

<P>of man's heart is evil from his youth."&nbsp; [Rom. 8:21]&nbsp; Now
then,

<P>when we think thus of ourselves, having sense thereof,

<P>then are our thoughts good ones, because according to the Word of God.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning thyself

<P>in thy life.&nbsp; But let me go on.&nbsp; As the Word passeth a judgment

<P>upon our heart, so it passeth a judgment upon our ways; and when

<P>OUR thoughts of our hearts and ways agree with the judgment which

<P>the Word giveth of both, then are both good, because agreeing thereto.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{359}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Make out your meaning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, the Word of God saith that man's ways are crooked ways;

<P>not good, but perverse.&nbsp; [Ps. 125:5, Prov. 2:15]&nbsp; It saith

<P>they are naturally out of the good way, that they have not known it.

<P>[Rom. 3]&nbsp; Now, when a man thus thinketh of his ways,--I say,

<P>when he doth sensibly, and with heart-humiliation, thus think,

<P>then hath he good thoughts of his own ways, because his thoughts

<P>now agree with the judgment of the Word of God.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{360}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What are good thoughts concerning God?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Even as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts
of God

<P>do agree with what the Word saith of him; and that is,

<P>when we think of his being and attributes as the Word hath taught,

<P>of which I cannot now discourse at large; but to speak of him

<P>with reference to us:&nbsp; Then we have right thoughts of God,

<P>when we think that he knows us better than we know ourselves,

<P>and can see sin in us when and where we can see none in ourselves;

<P>when we think he knows our inmost thoughts, and that our heart,

<P>with all its depths, is always open unto his eyes; also,

<P>when we think that all our righteousness stinks in his nostrils,

<P>and that, therefore, he cannot abide to see us stand before him

<P>in any confidence, even in all our best performances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{361}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Do you think that I am such a fool as to think God can
see

<P>no further than I? or, that I would come to God in the best

<P>of my performances?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, how dost thou think in this matter?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Why, to be short, I think I must believe in Christ

<P>for justification.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; How! think thou must believe in Christ, when thou seest not
thy

<P>need of him!&nbsp; Thou neither seest thy original nor actual infirmities;

<P>but hast such an opinion of thyself, and of what thou dost,

<P>as plainly renders thee to be one that did never see a necessity

<P>of Christ's personal righteousness to justify thee before God.

<P>How, then, dost thou say, I believe in Christ?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{362}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I believe well enough for all that.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; How dost thou believe?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The faith of Ignorance>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I believe that Christ died for sinners, and that I shall
be

<P>justified before God from the curse, through his gracious acceptance

<P>of my obedience to his law.&nbsp; Or thus, Christ makes my duties,

<P>that are religious, acceptable to his Father, by virtue of his merits;

<P>and so shall I be justified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{363}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Let me give an answer to this confession of thy faith:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1.&nbsp; Thou believest with a fantastical faith; for this faith is
nowhere

<P>described in the Word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; Thou believest with a false faith; because it taketh justification

<P>from the personal righteousness of Christ, and applies it to thy own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3.&nbsp; This faith maketh not Christ a justifier of thy person,

<P>but of thy actions; and of thy person for thy actions' sake,

<P>which is false.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4.&nbsp; Therefore, this faith is deceitful, even such as will leave
thee

<P>under wrath, in the day of God Almighty; for true justifying faith

<P>puts the soul, as sensible of its condition by the law, upon flying

<P>for refuge unto Christ's righteousness, which righteousness of his

<P>is not an act of grace, by which he maketh for justification,

<P>thy obedience accepted with God; but his personal obedience to the law,

<P>in doing and suffering for us what that required at our hands;

<P>this righteousness, I say, true faith accepteth; under the skirt

<P>of which, the soul being shrouded, and by it presented

<P>as spotless before God, it is accepted, and acquit from condemnation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{364}

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What! would you have us trust to what Christ, in his own
person,

<P>has done without us?&nbsp; This conceit would loosen the reins of our
lust,

<P>and tolerate us to live as we list; for what matter how we live,

<P>if we may be justified by Christ's personal righteousness from all,

<P>when we believe it?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ignorance is thy name, and as thy name is, so art thou;

<P>even this thy answer demonstrateth what I say.&nbsp; Ignorant thou art

<P>of what justifying righteousness is, and as ignorant how to secure

<P>thy soul, through the faith of it, from the heavy wrath of God.

<P>Yea, thou also art ignorant of the true effects of saving faith

<P>in this righteousness of Christ, which is, to bow and win over

<P>the heart to God in Christ, to love his name, his word, ways,

<P>and people, and not as thou ignorantly imaginest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Ask him if ever he had Christ revealed to him from heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{365}

<P>&lt;Ignorance jangles with them>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What! you are a man for revelations!&nbsp; I believe that
what

<P>both you, and all the rest of you, say about that matter,

<P>is but the fruit of distracted brains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why, man! Christ is so hid in God from the natural apprehensions

<P>of the flesh, that he cannot by any man be savingly known,

<P>unless God the Father reveals him to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{366}

<P>&lt;He speaks reproachfully of what he knows not>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt not,

<P>is as good as yours, though I have not in my head so many whimsies

<P>as you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Give me leave to put in a word.&nbsp; You ought not so slightly

<P>to speak of this matter; for this I will boldly affirm,

<P>even as my good companion hath done, that no man can know Jesus Christ

<P>but by the revelation of the Father; [Matt. 11:27] yea, and faith too,

<P>by which the soul layeth hold upon Christ, if it be right,

<P>must be wrought by the exceeding greatness of his mighty power;

<P>the working of which faith, I perceive, poor Ignorance,

<P>thou art ignorant of.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 12:3, Eph. 1:18,19]&nbsp; Be awakened,
then,

<P>see thine own wretchedness, and fly to the Lord Jesus;

<P>and by his righteousness, which is the righteousness of God,

<P>for he himself is God, thou shalt be delivered from condemnation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{367}

<P>&lt;The talk broke up>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; You go so fast, I cannot keep pace with you.

<P>Do you go on before; I must stay a while behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if thou yet refuse it, thou shalt know,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long, the evil of thy doing so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, man, in time, stoop, do not fear;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good counsel taken well, saves:&nbsp; therefore
hear.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if thou yet shalt slight it, thou wilt
be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loser, (Ignorance), I'll warrant thee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Christian addressed thus himself to his fellow:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, come, my good Hopeful, I perceive that thou and I

<P>must walk by ourselves again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{368}

<P>So I saw in my dream that they went on apace before,

<P>and Ignorance he came hobbling after.&nbsp; Then said Christian

<P>to his companion, It pities me much for this poor man,

<P>it will certainly go ill with him at last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Alas! there are abundance in our town in his condition,

<P>whole families, yea, whole streets, and that of pilgrims too;

<P>and if there be so many in our parts, how many, think you,

<P>must there be in the place where he was born?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Indeed the Word saith, "He hath blinded their eyes,

<P>lest they should see", &amp;c.&nbsp; But now we are by ourselves,

<P>what do you think of such men?&nbsp; Have they at no time, think you,

<P>convictions of sin, and so consequently fears that their state

<P>is dangerous?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Nay, do you answer that question yourself, for you are

<P>the elder man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then I say, sometimes (as I think) they may; but they being

<P>naturally ignorant, understand not that such convictions tend

<P>to their good; and therefore they do desperately seek to stifle them,

<P>and presumptuously continue to flatter themselves in the way of

<P>their own hearts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{369}

<P>&lt;The good use of fear>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I do believe, as you say, that fear tends much to men's
good,

<P>and to make them right, at their beginning to go on pilgrimage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Without all doubt it doth, if it be right; for so says the
Word,

<P>"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."

<P>{370}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; How will you describe right fear?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Right fear>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; True or right fear is discovered by three things:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1.&nbsp; By its rise; it is caused by saving convictions for sin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; It driveth the soul to lay fast hold of Christ for salvation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3.&nbsp; It begetteth and continueth in the soul a great reverence of
God,

<P>his Word, and ways, keeping it tender, and making it afraid

<P>to turn from them, to the right hand or to the left,

<P>to anything that may dishonour God, break its peace, grieve the Spirit,

<P>or cause the enemy to speak reproachfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Well said; I believe you have said the truth.

<P>Are we now almost got past the Enchanted Ground?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, art thou weary of this discourse?

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; No, verily, but that I would know where we are.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{371}

<P>&lt;Why ignorant persons stifle convictions>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; We have not now above two miles further to go thereon.

<P>But let us return to our matter.&nbsp; &lt;In general>&nbsp; Now the
ignorant

<P>know not that such convictions as tend to put them in fear

<P>are for their good, and therefore they seek to stifle them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; How do they seek to stifle them?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{372}

<P>&lt;In particular>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; They think that those fears are wrought by the devil,

<P>(though indeed they are wrought of God); and, thinking so,

<P>they resist them as things that directly tend to their overthrow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; They also think that these fears tend to the spoiling

<P>of their faith, when, alas, for them, poor men that they are,

<P>they have none at all! and therefore they harden their hearts

<P>against them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3.&nbsp; They presume they ought not to fear; and, therefore,

<P>in despite of them, wax presumptuously confident.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4.&nbsp; They see that those fears tend to take away from them

<P>their pitiful old self-holiness, and therefore they resist them

<P>&lt;Talk about one Temporary>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well then, did you not know, about ten years ago,

<P>one Temporary in your parts, who was a forward man in religion then?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Where he dwelt>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Know him! yes, he dwelt in Graceless, a town about two miles

<P>off of Honesty, and he dwelt next door to one Turnback.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{374}

<P>&lt;He was towardly once>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Right, he dwelt under the same roof with him.&nbsp; Well,

<P>that man was much awakened once; I believe that then he had

<P>some sight of his sins, and of the wages that were due thereto.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I am of your mind, for, my house not being above three miles

<P>from him, he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many tears.

<P>Truly I pitied the man, and was not altogether without hope of him;

<P>but one may see, it is not every one that cries, Lord, Lord.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; He told me once that he was resolved to go on pilgrimage,

<P>as we do now; but all of a sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self,

<P>and then he became a stranger to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{375}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Now, since we are talking about him, let us a little inquire

<P>into the reason of the sudden backsliding of him and such others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; It may be very profitable, but do you begin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Reasons why towardly ones go back>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Well, then, there are in my judgment four reasons for it:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{376}

<P>1.&nbsp; Though the consciences of such men are awakened, yet their
minds

<P>are not changed; therefore, when the power of guilt weareth away,

<P>that which provoked them to be religious ceaseth, wherefore they

<P>naturally turn to their own course again, even as we see the dog

<P>that is sick of what he has eaten, so long as his sickness prevails

<P>he vomits and casts up all; not that he doth this of a free mind

<P>(if we may say a dog has a mind), but because it troubleth his stomach;

<P>but now, when his sickness is over, and so his stomach eased,

<P>his desire being not at all alienate from his vomit, he turns him about

<P>and licks up all, and so it is true which is written, "The dog is turned

<P>to his own vomit again."&nbsp; [2 Pet. 2:22]&nbsp; Thus I say,

<P>being hot for heaven, by virtue only of the sense and fear

<P>of the torments of hell, as their sense of hell and the fears

<P>of damnation chills and cools, so their desires for heaven and salvation

<P>cool also.&nbsp; So then it comes to pass, that when their guilt and
fear

<P>is gone, their desires for heaven and happiness die, and they return

<P>to their course again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{377}

<P>2.&nbsp; Another reason is, they have slavish fears that do overmaster
them;

<P>I speak now of the fears that they have of men, for "the fear of man

<P>bringeth a snare".&nbsp; [Prov. 29:25]&nbsp; So then, though they seem
to be

<P>hot for heaven, so long as the flames of hell are about their ears,

<P>yet when that terror is a little over, they betake themselves

<P>to second thoughts; namely, that it is good to be wise, and not to run

<P>(for they know not what) the hazard of losing all, or, at least,

<P>of bringing themselves into unavoidable and unnecessary troubles,

<P>and so they fall in with the world again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{378}

<P>3. The shame that attends religion lies also as a block in their way;

<P>they are proud and haughty; and religion in their eye

<P>is low and contemptible, therefore, when they have lost their sense

<P>of hell and wrath to come, they return again to their former course.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{379}

<P>4. Guilt, and to meditate terror, are grievous to them.

<P>They like not to see their misery before they come into it;

<P>though perhaps the sight of it first, if they loved that sight,

<P>might make them fly whither the righteous fly and are safe.

<P>But because they do, as I hinted before, even shun the thoughts

<P>of guilt and terror, therefore, when once they are rid

<P>of their awakenings about the terrors and wrath of God,

<P>they harden their hearts gladly, and choose such ways as will

<P>harden them more and more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{380}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; You are pretty near the business, for the bottom of all

<P>is for want of a change in their mind and will.&nbsp; And therefore

<P>they are but like the felon that standeth before the judge,

<P>he quakes and trembles, and seems to repent most heartily,

<P>but the bottom of all is the fear of the halter; not that he hath

<P>any detestation of the offence, as is evident, because,

<P>let but this man have his liberty, and he will be a thief,

<P>and so a rogue still, whereas, if his mind was changed,

<P>he would be otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{381}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Now I have showed you the reasons of their going back,

<P>do you show me the manner thereof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; So I will willingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;How the apostate goes back>

<P>1.&nbsp; They draw off their thoughts, all that they may,

<P>from the remembrance of God, death, and judgment to come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; Then they cast off by degrees private duties, as closet prayer,

<P>curbing their lusts, watching, sorrow for sin, and the like.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3.&nbsp; Then they shun the company of lively and warm Christians.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>4.&nbsp; After that they grow cold to public duty, as hearing, reading,

<P>godly conference, and the like.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>5.&nbsp; Then they begin to pick holes, as we say, in the coats

<P>of some of the godly; and that devilishly, that they may have

<P>a seeming colour to throw religion (for the sake of some infirmity

<P>they have espied in them) behind their backs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>6.&nbsp; Then they begin to adhere to, and associate themselves with,

<P>carnal, loose, and wanton men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>7.&nbsp; Then they give way to carnal and wanton discourses in secret;

<P>and glad are they if they can see such things in any

<P>that are counted honest, that they may the more boldly do it

<P>through their example.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>8.&nbsp; After this they begin to play with little sins openly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>9.&nbsp; And then, being hardened, they show themselves as they are.

<P>Thus, being launched again into the gulf of misery, unless a miracle

<P>of grace prevent it, they everlastingly perish in their own deceivings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{382}

<P>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time the Pilgrims were got over

<P>the Enchanted Ground, and entering into the country of Beulah, whose
air

<P>was very sweet and pleasant, the way lying directly through it,

<P>they solaced themselves there for a season.&nbsp; Yea, here they heard

<P>continually the singing of birds, and saw every day the flowers appear

<P>on the earth, and heard the voice of the turtle in the land.

<P>[Isa. 62:4, Song of Solomon 2:10-12]&nbsp; In this country

<P>the sun shineth night and day; wherefore this was beyond

<P>the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and also out of the reach

<P>of Giant Despair, neither could they from this place so much as see

<P>Doubting Castle.&nbsp; &lt;Angels>&nbsp; Here they were within sight
of the city

<P>they were going to, also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof;

<P>for in this land the Shining Ones commonly walked, because it was

<P>upon the borders of heaven.&nbsp; In this land also, the contract between

<P>the bride and the bridegroom was renewed; yea, here, "As the bridegroom

<P>rejoiceth over the bride, so did their God rejoice over them."

<P>[Isa. 62:5]&nbsp; Here they had no want of corn and wine; for in this
place

<P>they met with abundance of what they had sought for in all

<P>their pilgrimage.&nbsp; [Isa. 62:8]&nbsp; Here they heard voices from

<P>out of the city, loud voices, saying, "`Say ye to the daughter of Zion,

<P>Behold, thy salvation cometh!&nbsp; Behold, his reward is with him!'

<P>Here all the inhabitants of the country called them, `The holy people,

<P>The redeemed of the Lord, Sought out'", etc.&nbsp; [Isa. 62:11,12]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{383}

<P>Now as they walked in this land, they had more rejoicing than in parts

<P>more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound; and drawing near

<P>to the city, they had yet a more perfect view thereof.&nbsp; It was
builded

<P>of pearls and precious stones, also the street thereof was paved

<P>with gold; so that by reason of the natural glory of the city,

<P>and the reflection of the sunbeams upon it, Christian with desire

<P>fell sick; Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same disease.

<P>Wherefore, here they lay by it a while, crying out, because of

<P>their pangs, If ye find my beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{384}

<P>But, being a little strengthened, and better able to bear

<P>their sickness, they walked on their way, and came yet nearer

<P>and nearer, where were orchards, vineyards, and gardens,

<P>and their gates opened into the highway.&nbsp; Now, as they came up

<P>to these places, behold the gardener stood in the way,

<P>to whom the Pilgrims said, Whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these?

<P>He answered, They are the King's, and are planted here

<P>for his own delight, and also for the solace of pilgrims.

<P>So the gardener had them into the vineyards, and bid them

<P>refresh themselves with the dainties.&nbsp; [Deut. 23:24]

<P>He also showed them there the King's walks, and the arbours where

<P>he delighted to be; and here they tarried and slept.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{385}

<P>Now I beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep

<P>at this time than ever they did in all their journey;

<P>and being in a muse thereabout, the gardener said even to me,

<P>Wherefore musest thou at the matter?&nbsp; It is the nature of the fruit

<P>of the grapes of these vineyards to go down so sweetly

<P>as to cause the lips of them that are asleep to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{386}

<P>So I saw that when they awoke, they addressed themselves to go up

<P>to the city; but, as I said, the reflection of the sun upon the city

<P>(for the city was pure gold) was so extremely glorious

<P>that they could not, as yet, with open face behold it, but through

<P>an instrument made for that purpose.&nbsp; So I saw, that as I went
on,

<P>there met them two men, in raiment that shone like gold;

<P>lso their faces shone as the light.&nbsp; [Rev. 21:18, 2 Cor. 3:18]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{387}

<P>These men asked the Pilgrims whence they came; and they told them.

<P>They also asked them where they had lodged, what difficulties

<P>and dangers, what comforts and pleasures they had met in the way;

<P>and they told them.&nbsp; Then said the men that met them, You have

<P>but two difficulties more to meet with, and then you are in the city.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{388}

<P>Christian then, and his companion, asked the men to go along with them;

<P>so they told them they would.&nbsp; But, said they, you must obtain
it

<P>by your own faith.&nbsp; So I saw in my dream that they went on together,

<P>until they came in sight of the gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{389}

<P>&lt;Death>

<P>Now, I further saw, that betwixt them and the gate was a river,

<P>but there was no bridge to go over: the river was very deep.

<P>At the sight, therefore, of this river, the Pilgrims were much stunned;

<P>but the men that went in with them said, You must go through,

<P>or you cannot come at the gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{390}

<P>&lt;Death is not welcome to nature, though by it we pass out of this
world

<P>into glory*>

<P>The Pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other way

<P>to the gate; to which they answered, Yes; but there hath not any,

<P>save two, to wit, Enoch and Elijah, been permitted to tread that path

<P>since the foundation of the world, nor shall, until the last trumpet

<P>shall sound.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 15:51,52]&nbsp; The Pilgrims then,

<P>especially Christian, began to despond in their minds,

<P>and looked this way and that, but no way could be found by them

<P>by which they might escape the river.&nbsp; Then they asked the men

<P>if the waters were all of a depth.&nbsp; &lt;Angels help us not comfortably

<P>through death> They said:&nbsp; No; yet they could not help them

<P>in that case; for, said they, you shall find it deeper or shallower

<P>as you believe in the King of the place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>*In the Resurrection of the Righteous.&nbsp; [Rev. 20:4-6]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{391}

<P>They then addressed themselves to the water and, entering,

<P>Christian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend Hopeful,

<P>he said, I sink in deep waters; the billows go over my head,

<P>all his waves go over me! Selah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{392}

<P>&lt;Christian's conflict at the hour of death>

<P>Then said the other, Be of good cheer, my brother, I feel the bottom,

<P>and it is good.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Ah! my friend,

<P>the sorrows of death hath compassed me about; I shall not see the land

<P>that flows with milk and honey; and with that a great darkness

<P>and horror fell upon Christian, so that he could not see before him.

<P>Also here he in great measure lost his senses, so that he could neither

<P>remember nor orderly talk of any of those sweet refreshments

<P>that he had met with in the way of his pilgrimage.&nbsp; But all the
words

<P>that he spake still tended to discover that he had horror of mind,

<P>and heart fears that he should die in that river, and never obtain

<P>entrance in at the gate.&nbsp; Here also, as they that stood by perceived,

<P>he was much in the troublesome thoughts of the sins that he

<P>had committed, both since and before he began to be a pilgrim.

<P>It was also observed that he was troubled with apparitions

<P>of hobgoblins and evil spirits, for ever and anon he would

<P>intimate so much by words.&nbsp; Hopeful, therefore, here had much ado

<P>to keep his brother's head above water; yea, sometimes he would be

<P>quite gone down, and then, ere a while, he would rise up again

<P>half dead.&nbsp; Hopeful also would endeavour to comfort him, saying,

<P>Brother, I see the gate, and men standing by to receive us:

<P>but Christian would answer, It is you, it is you they wait for;

<P>you have been Hopeful ever since I knew you.&nbsp; And so have you,

<P>said he to Christian.&nbsp; Ah! brother! said he, surely if I was right

<P>he would now arise to help me; but for my sins he hath brought me

<P>into the snare, and hath left me.&nbsp; Then said Hopeful, My brother,

<P>you have quite forgot the text, where it is said of the wicked,

<P>"There are no bands in their death, but their strength is firm.

<P>They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued

<P>like other men.&nbsp; [Ps. 73:4,5]&nbsp; These troubles and distresses
that you

<P>go through in these waters are no sign that God hath forsaken you;

<P>but are sent to try you, whether you will call to mind that which

<P>heretofore you have received of his goodness, and live upon him

<P>in your distresses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{393}

<P>&lt;Christian delivered from his fears in death>

<P>Then I saw in my dream, that Christian was as in a muse a while.

<P>To whom also Hopeful added this word, Be of good cheer,

<P>Jesus Christ maketh thee whole; and with that Christian brake out

<P>with a loud voice, Oh, I see him again! and he tells me,

<P>"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee,

<P>and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee."&nbsp; [Isa. 43:2]

<P>Then they both took courage, and the enemy was after that as still

<P>as a stone, until they were gone over.&nbsp; Christian therefore

<P>presently found ground to stand upon, and so it followed that

<P>the rest of the river was but shallow.&nbsp; Thus they got over.

<P>&lt;The angels do wait for them, so soon as they are passed out

<P>of this world>&nbsp; Now, upon the bank of the river, on the other side,

<P>they saw the two shining men again, who there waited for them;

<P>wherefore, being come out of the river, they saluted them, saying,

<P>We are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those that

<P>shall be heirs of salvation.&nbsp; Thus they went along towards the
gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{394}

<P>&lt;They have put off mortality>&nbsp; Now you must note that the city
stood

<P>upon a mighty hill, but the Pilgrims went up that hill with ease,

<P>because they had these two men to lead them up by the arms;

<P>also, they had left their mortal garments behind them in the river,

<P>for though they went in with them, they came out without them.

<P>They, therefore, went up here with much agility and speed,

<P>though the foundation upon which the city was framed was higher than

<P>the clouds.&nbsp; They therefore went up through the regions of the
air,

<P>sweetly talking as they went, being comforted, because they safely

<P>got over the river, and had such glorious companions to attend them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, now, look how the holy pilgrims ride,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds are their chariots, angels are their
guide:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would not here for him all hazards run,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thus provides for his when this world's
done?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{395}

<P>The talk they had with the Shining Ones was about the glory

<P>of the place; who told them that the beauty and glory of it

<P>was inexpressible.&nbsp; There, said they, is the Mount Zion,

<P>the heavenly Jerusalem, the innumerable company of angels,

<P>and the spirits of just men made perfect.&nbsp; [Heb. 12:22-24]

<P>You are going now, said they, to the paradise of God, wherein you shall

<P>see the tree of life, and eat of the never-fading fruits thereof;

<P>and when you come there, you shall have white robes given you,

<P>and your walk and talk shall be every day with the King,

<P>even all the days of eternity.&nbsp; [Rev. 2:7, 3:4, 21:4,5]

<P>There you shall not see again such things as you saw when you were in

<P>the lower region upon the earth, to wit, sorrow, sickness, affliction,

<P>and death, for the former things are passed away.&nbsp; You are now
going

<P>to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob, and to the prophets--men that God

<P>hath taken away from the evil to come, and that are now resting

<P>upon their beds, each one walking in his righteousness.&nbsp; [Isa.
57:1,2,

<P>65:17]&nbsp; The men then asked, What must we do in the holy place?

<P>To whom it was answered, You must there receive the comforts

<P>of all your toil, and have joy for all your sorrow; you must reap

<P>what you have sown, even the fruit of all your prayers, and tears,

<P>and sufferings for the King by the way.&nbsp; [Gal. 6:7]&nbsp; In that
place

<P>you must wear crowns of gold, and enjoy the perpetual sight and vision

<P>of the Holy One, for there you shall see him as he is.&nbsp; [1 John
3:2]

<P>There also you shall serve him continually with praise, with shouting,

<P>and thanksgiving, whom you desired to serve in the world,

<P>though with much difficulty, because of the infirmity of your flesh.

<P>There your eyes shall be delighted with seeing, and your ears with

<P>hearing the pleasant voice of the Mighty One.&nbsp; There you shall

<P>enjoy your friends again that are gone thither before you;

<P>and there you shall with joy receive, even every one that follows

<P>into the holy place after you.&nbsp; There also shall you be clothed

<P>with glory and majesty, and put into an equipage fit to ride out

<P>with the King of Glory.&nbsp; When he shall come with sound of trumpet

<P>in the clouds, as upon the wings of the wind, you shall come with him;

<P>and when he shall sit upon the throne of judgment; you shall sit by
him;

<P>yea, and when he shall pass sentence upon all the workers of iniquity,

<P>let them be angels or men, you also shall have a voice in that judgment,

<P>because they were his and your enemies.&nbsp; [1 Thes. 4:13-16, Jude
1:14,

<P>Dan. 7:9,10, 1 Cor. 6:2,3]&nbsp; Also, when he shall again return to

<P>the city, you shall go too, with sound of trumpet, and be ever with
him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{396}

<P>Now while they were thus drawing towards the gate, behold a company

<P>of the heavenly host came out to meet them; to whom it was said,

<P>by the other two Shining Ones, These are the men that have

<P>loved our Lord when they were in the world, and that have left all

<P>for his holy name; and he hath sent us to fetch them, and we have

<P>brought them thus far on their desired journey, that they may go in

<P>and look their Redeemer in the face with joy.&nbsp; Then the heavenly
host

<P>gave a great shout, saying, "Blessed are they which are called unto

<P>the marriage supper of the Lamb."&nbsp; [Rev. 19:9]&nbsp; There came
out also

<P>at this time to meet them, several of the King's trumpeters,

<P>clothed in white and shining raiment, who, with melodious noises,

<P>and loud, made even the heavens to echo with their sound.

<P>These trumpeters saluted Christian and his fellow with ten thousand

<P>welcomes from the world; and this they did with shouting,

<P>and sound of trumpet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{397}

<P>This done, they compassed them round on every side; some went before,

<P>some behind, and some on the right hand, some on the left,

<P>(as it were to guard them through the upper regions),

<P>continually sounding as they went, with melodious noise,

<P>in notes on high:&nbsp; so that the very sight was, to them that could

<P>behold it, as if heaven itself was come down to meet them.&nbsp; Thus,

<P>therefore, they walked on together; and as they walked,

<P>ever and anon these trumpeters, even with joyful sound,

<P>would, by mixing their music with looks and gestures,

<P>still signify to Christian and his brother, how welcome they were

<P>into their company, and with what gladness they came to meet them;

<P>and now were these two men, as it were, in heaven, before they came

<P>at it, being swallowed up with the sight of angels, and with hearing

<P>of their melodious notes.&nbsp; Here also they had the city itself in
view,

<P>and they thought they heard all the bells therein to ring,

<P>to welcome them thereto.&nbsp; But above all, the warm and joyful thoughts

<P>that they had about their own dwelling there, with such company,

<P>and that for ever and ever.&nbsp; Oh, by what tongue or pen can

<P>their glorious joy be expressed!&nbsp; And thus they came up to the
gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{398}

<P>Now, when they were come up to the gate, there was written over

<P>it in letters of gold, "Blessed are they that do his commandments,

<P>that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in

<P>through the gates into the city."&nbsp; [Rev. 22:14]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{399}

<P>Then I saw in my dream that the Shining Men bid them call at the gate;

<P>the which, when they did, some looked from above over the gate, to wit,

<P>Enoch, Moses, and Elijah, &amp;c., to whom it was said, These pilgrims

<P>are come from the City of Destruction, for the love that they bear

<P>to the King of this place; and then the Pilgrims gave in unto them

<P>each man his certificate, which they had received in the beginning;

<P>those, therefore, were carried in to the King, who, when he had

<P>read them, said, Where are the men?&nbsp; To whom it was answered,

<P>They are standing without the gate.&nbsp; The King then commanded

<P>to open the gate, "That the righteous nation," said he,

<P>"which keepeth the truth, may enter in."&nbsp; [Isa. 26:2]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{400}

<P>Now I saw in my dream that these two men went in at the gate: and lo,

<P>as they entered, they were transfigured, and they had raiment put on

<P>that shone like gold.&nbsp; There was also that met them with

<P>harps and crowns, and gave them to them--the harps to praise withal,

<P>and the crowns in token of honour.&nbsp; Then I heard in my dream

<P>that all the bells in the city rang again for joy, and that

<P>it was said unto them, "ENTER YE INTO THE JOY OF YOUR LORD."

<P>I also heard the men themselves, that they sang with a loud voice,

<P>saying, "BLESSING AND HONOUR, AND GLORY, AND POWER, BE UNTO HIM

<P>THAT SITTETH UPON THE THRONE, AND UNTO THE LAMB, FOR EVER AND EVER."

<P>[Rev. 5:13]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{401}

<P>Now, just as the gates were opened to let in the men,

<P>I looked in after them, and, behold, the City shone like the sun;

<P>the streets also were paved with gold, and in them walked many men,

<P>with crowns on their heads, palms in their hands, and golden harps

<P>to sing praises withal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{402}

<P>There were also of them that had wings, and they answered one another

<P>without intermission, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord."

<P>[Rev. 4:8]&nbsp; And after that they shut up the gates; which,

<P>when I had seen, I wished myself among them.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Ignorance comes up to the river>

<P>Now while I was gazing upon all these things, I turned my head

<P>to look back, and saw Ignorance come up to the river side;

<P>but he soon got over, and that without half that difficulty which

<P>the other two men met with.&nbsp; &lt;Vain-hope does ferry him over>

<P>For it happened that there was then in that place, one Vain-hope,

<P>a ferryman, that with his boat helped him over; so he,

<P>as the other I saw, did ascend the hill, to come up to the gate,

<P>only he came alone; neither did any man meet him with

<P>the least encouragement.&nbsp; When he was come up to the gate,

<P>he looked up to the writing that was above, and then began to knock,

<P>supposing that entrance should have been quickly administered to him;

<P>but he was asked by the men that looked over the top of the gate,

<P>Whence came you, and what would you have?&nbsp; He answered,

<P>I have eat and drank in the presence of the King, and he has taught

<P>in our streets.&nbsp; Then they asked him for his certificate,

<P>that they might go in and show it to the King; so he fumbled

<P>in his bosom for one, and found none.&nbsp; Then said they, Have you
none?

<P>But the man answered never a word.&nbsp; So they told the King,

<P>but he would not come down to see him, but commanded

<P>the two Shining Ones that conducted Christian and Hopeful to the City,

<P>to go out and take Ignorance, and bind him hand and foot,

<P>and have him away.&nbsp; Then they took him up, and carried him

<P>through the air to the door that I saw in the side of the hill,

<P>and put him in there.&nbsp; Then I saw that there was a way to hell,

<P>even from the gates of heaven, as well as from the City of Destruction.

<P>So I awoke, and behold it was a dream.
