<P>{10}

<P>As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on

<P>a certain place where was a Den &lt;The Jail/Gaol>, and I laid me down

<P>in that place to sleep:&nbsp; and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream.

<P>I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags,

<P>standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house,

<P>a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back.&nbsp; [Isa. 64:6;

<P>Luke 14:33; Ps. 38:4; Hab. 2:2; Acts 16:30,31]&nbsp; I looked,

<P>and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read,

<P>he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain,

<P>&lt;His Outcry> he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying,

<P>"What shall I do?"&nbsp; [Acts 2:37]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{11}

<P>In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself

<P>as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive

<P>his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that

<P>his trouble increased.&nbsp; Wherefore at length he brake his mind

<P>to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them:

<P>O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels,

<P>I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden

<P>that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that

<P>this our city &lt;This world> will be burned with fire from heaven;

<P>in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife,

<P>and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin,

<P>except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found,

<P>whereby we may be delivered.&nbsp; &lt;He knows not the way yet/He knows
no way

<P>of escape as of yet>&nbsp; At this his relations were sore amazed;

<P>not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true,

<P>but because they thought that some frenzy distemper had got into

<P>his head; therefore, it drawing towards night, and they hoping

<P>that sleep might settle his brains, with all haste they got him to bed.

<P>But the night was as troublesome to him as the day; wherefore,

<P>instead of sleeping, he spent it in sighs and tears.&nbsp; So,

<P>when the morning was come, they would know how he did.

<P>He told them, Worse and worse:&nbsp; he also set to talking to them
again;

<P>but they began to be hardened.&nbsp; &lt;Carnal physic for a sick soul>

<P>They also thought to drive away his distemper by harsh and surly

<P>carriages to him; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they

<P>would chide, and sometimes they would quite neglect him.

<P>Wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber, to pray for

<P>and pity them, and also to condole his own misery; he would also

<P>walk solitarily in the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying:

<P>and thus for some days he spent his time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{12}

<P>Now, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that he
was,

<P>as he was wont, reading in his book, and greatly distressed in his mind;

<P>and, as he read, he burst out, as he had done before, crying,

<P>"What shall I do to be saved?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{13}

<P>I saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he would run;

<P>yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not tell

<P>which way to go.&nbsp; I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist

<P>coming to him and asked, Wherefore dost thou cry?&nbsp; [Job 33:23]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{14}

<P>He answered, Sir, I perceive by the book in my hand, that I am

<P>condemned to die, and after that to come to judgement [Heb. 9:27];

<P>and I find that I am not willing to do the first [Job 16:21],

<P>nor able to do the second.&nbsp; [Ezek. 22:14]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHRISTIAN no sooner leaves the World but meets

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EVANGELIST, who lovingly him greets

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With tidings of another:&nbsp; and doth show

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him how to mount to that from this below.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{15}

<P>Then said Evangelist, Why not willing to die, since this life

<P>is attended with so many evils?&nbsp; The man answered, Because I fear

<P>that this burden is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave,

<P>and I shall fall into Tophet.&nbsp; [Isa. 30:33]&nbsp; And, Sir, if
I be not fit

<P>to go to prison, I am not fit, I am sure, to go to judgement,

<P>and from thence to execution; and the thoughts of these things

<P>make me cry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{16}

<P>&lt;Conviction of the necessity of flying>

<P>Then said Evangelist, If this be thy condition, why standest thou still?

<P>He answered, Because I know not whither to go.&nbsp; Then he gave him

<P>a parchment roll, and there was written within, Flee from the wrath

<P>to come.&nbsp; [Matt. 3.7]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{17}

<P>The man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist very carefully,

<P>said, Whither must I fly?&nbsp; Then said Evangelist, pointing with

<P>his finger over a very wide field, Do you see yonder wicket-gate?

<P>[Matt. 7:13,14]&nbsp; &lt;Christ, and the way to Him cannot be found

<P>without the Word>&nbsp; The man said, No.&nbsp; Then said the other,

<P>Do you see yonder shining light?&nbsp; [Ps. 119:105; 2 Pet. 1:19]&nbsp;
He said,

<P>I think I do.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist, Keep that light in your eye,

<P>and go up directly thereto:&nbsp; so shalt thou see the gate; at which,

<P>when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{18}

<P>So I saw in my dream that the man began to run.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, he had not run far from his own door, but his wife and children,

<P>perceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but the man

<P>put his fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying, Life! life!

<P>eternal life! [Luke 14:26]&nbsp; So he looked not behind him,

<P>but fled towards the middle of the plain.&nbsp; [Gen. 19:17]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{19}

<P>&lt;They that fly from the wrath to come, are a gazing-stock of the
world>

<P>The neighbours also came out to see him run [Jer. 20:10]; and,

<P>as he ran, some mocked, others threatened, and some cried after him

<P>to return; and, among those that did so, there were two that resolved

<P>to fetch him back by force.&nbsp; &lt;Obstinate and Pliable follow him>

<P>The name of the one was Obstinate and the name of the other Pliable.

<P>Now, by this time, the man was got a good distance from them; but,

<P>however, they were resolved to pursue him, which they did,

<P>and in a little time they overtook him.&nbsp; Then said the man, Neighbours,

<P>wherefore are ye come?&nbsp; They said, To persuade you to go back with
us.

<P>But he said, That can by no means be; you dwell, said he,

<P>in the City of Destruction, the place also where I was born:

<P>I see it to be so; and, dying there, sooner or later,

<P>you will sink lower than the grave, into a place that burns

<P>with fire and brimstone:&nbsp; be content, good neighbours,

<P>and go along with me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{20}

<P>OBST.&nbsp; What! said Obstinate, and leave our friends and our comforts

<P>behind us?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, said Christian, for that was his name, because that
ALL

<P>which you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little

<P>of that which I am seeking to enjoy [2 Cor. 4:18]; and,

<P>if you will go along with me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself;

<P>for there, where I go, is enough and to spare.&nbsp; [Luke 15:17]

<P>Come away, and prove my words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{21}

<P>OBST.&nbsp; What are the things you seek, since you leave all the world

<P>to find them?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I seek an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that

<P>fadeth not away [1 Pet. 1:4], and it is laid up in heaven,

<P>and safe there [Heb. 11:16], to be bestowed, at the time appointed,

<P>on them that diligently seek it.&nbsp; Read it so, if you will, in my
book.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>OBST.&nbsp; Tush! said Obstinate, away with your book; will you

<P>go back with us or no?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; No, not I, said the other, because I have laid my hand

<P>to the plough.&nbsp; [Luke 9:62]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{22}

<P>OBST.&nbsp; Come, then, neighbour Pliable, let us turn again, and go
home

<P>without him; there is a company of these crazy-headed coxcombs, that,

<P>when they take a fancy by the end, are wiser in their own eyes

<P>than seven men that can render a reason.&nbsp; [Prov. 26:16]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Then said Pliable, Don't revile; if what the good Christian
says

<P>is true, the things he looks after are better than ours:

<P>my heart inclines to go with my neighbour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>OBST.&nbsp; What! more fools still! Be ruled by me, and go back;

<P>who knows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you?&nbsp; Go back,

<P>go back, and be wise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{23}

<P>&lt;Christian and Obstinate pull for Pliable's soul>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Nay, but do thou come with thy neighbour, Pliable;

<P>there are such things to be had which I spoke of, and many

<P>more glorious besides.&nbsp; If you believe not me, read here in this
book;

<P>and for the truth of what is expressed therein, behold, all is confirmed

<P>by the blood of Him that made it.&nbsp; [Heb. 9:17-22; 13:20]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well, neighbour Obstinate, said Pliable, &lt;Pliable contented
to go

<P>with Christian> I begin to come to a point; I intend to go along

<P>with this good man, and to cast in my lot with him:&nbsp; but,

<P>my good companion, do you know the way to this desired place?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{24}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am directed by a man, whose name is Evangelist,

<P>to speed me to a little gate that is before us, where we shall receive

<P>instructions about the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Come, then, good neighbour, let us be going.&nbsp; Then they
went

<P>both together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>OBST.&nbsp; And I will go back to my place, said Obstinate;

<P>&lt;Obstinate goes railing back> I will be no companion of such misled,

<P>fantastical fellows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{25}

<P>Now, I saw in my dream, that when Obstinate was gone back,

<P>Christian and Pliable went talking over the plain; and thus they began

<P>their discourse.&nbsp; &lt;Talk between Christian and Pliable>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{26}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Come, neighbour Pliable, how do you do?&nbsp; I am glad you
are

<P>persuaded to go along with me.&nbsp; Had even Obstinate himself but
felt

<P>what I have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet unseen,

<P>he would not thus lightly have given us the back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Come, neighbour Christian, since there are none but us two
here,

<P>tell me now further what the things are, and how to be enjoyed,

<P>whither we are going.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{27}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak of
them

<P>with my tongue &lt;God's things unspeakable>:&nbsp; but yet, since you
are

<P>desirous to know, I will read of them in my book.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; And do you think that the words of your book are certainly
true?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, verily; for it was made by Him that cannot lie.&nbsp;
[Titus 1:2]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well said; what things are they?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and everlasting
life

<P>to be given us, that we may inhabit that kingdom for ever.&nbsp; [Isa.
45:17;

<P>John 10:28,29]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well said; and what else?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; There are crowns and glory to be given us, and garments

<P>that will make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven.

<P>[2 Tim. 4:8; Rev. 3:4; Matt. 13:43]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; This is very pleasant; and what else?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; There shall be no more crying, nor Sorrow:&nbsp; for He that
is

<P>owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes.&nbsp; [Isa. 25.6-8;

<P>Rev. 7:17, 21:4]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{28}

<P>PLI.&nbsp; And what company shall we have there?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims,

<P>creatures that will dazzle your eyes to look on them.&nbsp; [Isa. 6:2]

<P>There also you shall meet with thousands and ten thousands

<P>that have gone before us to that place; none of them are hurtful,

<P>but loving and holy; every one walking in the sight of God,

<P>and standing in his presence with acceptance for ever.

<P>[1 Thess. 4:16,17; Rev. 5:11]&nbsp; In a word, there we shall see the
elders

<P>with their golden crowns [Rev. 4:4], there we shall see the holy virgins

<P>with their golden harps [Rev. 14:1-5], there we shall see men

<P>that by the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts,

<P>drowned in the seas, for the love that they bare to the Lord

<P>of the place, all well, and clothed with immortality as with a garment.

<P>[John 12:25; 2 Cor. 5:4]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart.

<P>But are these things to be enjoyed?&nbsp; How shall we get to be

<P>sharers thereof?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded that

<P>in this book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing

<P>to have it, he will bestow it upon us freely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well, my good companion, glad am I to hear of these things:

<P>come on, let us mend our pace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason of this burden

<P>that is on my back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{29}

<P>&lt;The Slough of Despond>

<P>Now I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk

<P>they drew near to a very miry slough, that was in the midst

<P>of the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly

<P>into the bog.&nbsp; The name of the slough was Despond.&nbsp; Here,
therefore,

<P>they wallowed for a time, being grievously bedaubed with the dirt;

<P>and Christian, because of the burden that was on his back,

<P>began to sink in the mire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{30}

<P>PLI.&nbsp; Then said Pliable; Ah! neighbour Christian, where are you
now?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Truly, said Christian, I do not know.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PLI.&nbsp; At this Pliable began to be offended, and angrily said

<P>to his fellow, Is this the happiness you have told me all this while
of?

<P>If we have such ill speed at our first setting out, what may we expect

<P>betwixt this and our journey's end?&nbsp; May I get out again with my
life,

<P>you shall possess the brave country alone for me.&nbsp; &lt;It is not
enough

<P>to be pliable>&nbsp; And, with that, he gave a desperate struggle or
two,

<P>and got out of the mire on that side of the slough which was next to

<P>his own house:&nbsp; so away he went, and Christian saw him no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{31}

<P>Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Despond alone:

<P>but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the slough

<P>that was still further from his own house, and next to the wicket-gate;

<P>&lt;Christian in trouble seeks still to get further from his own house>

<P>the which he did, but could not get out, because of the burden

<P>that was upon his back:&nbsp; but I beheld in my dream, that a man

<P>came to him, whose name was Help, and asked him, What he did there?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, said Christian, I was bid go this way by a man

<P>called Evangelist, who directed me also to yonder gate,

<P>that I might escape the wrath to come; and as I was going thither

<P>I fell in here.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{32}

<P>&lt;The Promises>

<P>HELP.&nbsp; But why did not you look for the steps?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way, and fell
in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Help lifts him up>

<P>HELP.&nbsp; Then said he, Give me thy hand:&nbsp; so he gave him his
hand,

<P>and he drew him out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him

<P>go on his way.&nbsp; [Ps. 40:2]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{33}

<P>Then I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said, Sir, wherefore,

<P>since over this place is the way from the City of Destruction

<P>to yonder gate, is it that this plat is not mended, that poor travellers

<P>might go thither with more security?&nbsp; And he said unto me,

<P>&lt;What makes the Slough of Despond> This miry slough is such a place

<P>as cannot be mended; it is the descent whither the scum and filth

<P>that attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore

<P>it is called the Slough of Despond; for still, as the sinner is awakened

<P>about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul many fears,

<P>and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which all of them

<P>get together, and settle in this place.&nbsp; And this is the reason

<P>of the badness of this ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{34}

<P>It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain so
bad.

<P>[Isa. 35:3,4]&nbsp; His labourers also have, by the direction of

<P>His Majesty's surveyors, been for above these sixteen hundred years

<P>employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps it might

<P>have been mended:&nbsp; yea, and to my knowledge, said he,

<P>here have been swallowed up at least twenty thousand cart-loads,

<P>yea, millions of wholesome instructions, that have at all seasons

<P>been brought from all places of the King's dominions, and they that

<P>can tell, say they are the best materials to make good ground

<P>of the place; if so be, it might have been mended, but it is

<P>the Slough of Despond still, and so will be when they have done

<P>what they can.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{35}

<P>&lt;The promises of forgiveness and acceptance to life by faith in Christ>

<P>True, there are, by the direction of the Law-giver, certain good and

<P>substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of this slough;

<P>but at such time as this place doth much spew out its filth,

<P>as it doth against change of weather, these steps are hardly seen;

<P>or, if they be, men, through the dizziness of their heads, step beside,

<P>and then they are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding the steps

<P>be there; but the ground is good when they are once got in at the gate.

<P>&lt;Pliable got home, and is visited of his neighbours>

<P>Now, I saw in my dream, that by this time Pliable was got home

<P>&lt;His entertainment by them at his return> and some of them called
him

<P>wise man for coming back, and some called him fool for hazarding himself

<P>with Christian:&nbsp; others again did mock at his cowardliness; saying,

<P>Surely, since you began to venture, I would not have been so base

<P>to have given out for a few difficulties.&nbsp; So Pliable sat sneaking

<P>among them.&nbsp; But at last he got more confidence, and then they
all

<P>turned their tales, and began to deride poor Christian behind his back.

<P>And thus much concerning Pliable.

<P>but also it began to be the town talk in some other places,--

<P>Mr. Worldly Wiseman, therefore, having some guess of him,

<P>by beholding his laborious going, by observing his sighs and groans,

<P>and the like, began thus to enter into some talk with Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Talk betwixt Mr. Worldly Wiseman and Christian>

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; How now, good fellow, whither away after this burdened
manner?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; A burdened manner, indeed, as ever, I think, poor creature
had!

<P>And whereas you ask me, Whither away?&nbsp; I tell you, Sir,

<P>I am going to yonder wicket-gate before me; for there, as I am informed,

<P>I shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Hast thou a wife and children?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes; but I am so laden with this burden that I cannot take

<P>that pleasure in them as formerly; methinks I am as if I had none.

<P>[1 Cor 7:29]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Wilt thou hearken unto me if I give thee counsel?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; If it be good, I will; for I stand in need of good counsel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{39}

<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel to Christian>

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; I would advise thee, then, that thou with all speed

<P>get thyself rid of thy burden; for thou wilt never be settled

<P>in thy mind till then; nor canst thou enjoy the benefits

<P>of the blessing which God hath bestowed upon thee till then.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is that which I seek for, even to be rid of

<P>this heavy burden; but get it off myself, I cannot; nor is there

<P>any man in our country that can take it off my shoulders;

<P>therefore am I going this way, as I told you, that I may be rid of

<P>my burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; A man that appeared to me to be a very great and

<P>honourable person; his name, as I remember, is Evangelist.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{40}

<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman condemned Evangelist's counsel>

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; I beshrew him for his counsel! there is not a more dangerous

<P>and troublesome way in the world than is that unto which he hath

<P>directed thee; and that thou shalt find, if thou wilt be ruled

<P>by his counsel.&nbsp; Thou hast met with something, as I perceive, already;

<P>for I see the dirt of the Slough of Despond is upon thee;

<P>but that slough is the beginning of the sorrows that do attend those

<P>that go on in that way.&nbsp; Hear me, I am older than thou;

<P>thou art like to meet with, in the way which thou goest,

<P>wearisomeness, painfulness, hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions,

<P>dragons, darkness, and, in a word, death, and what not!&nbsp; These
things

<P>are certainly true, having been confirmed by many testimonies.

<P>And why should a man so carelessly cast away himself, by giving heed

<P>to a stranger?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The frame of the heart of a young Christian>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, Sir, this burden upon my back is more terrible to me

<P>than all these things which you have mentioned; nay, methinks I care
not

<P>what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also meet with deliverance

<P>from my burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{41}

<P>&lt;Worldly Wiseman does not like that men should be serious

<P>in reading the Bible>

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; How camest thou by the burden at first?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; By reading this book in my hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; I thought so; and it is happened unto thee as to other
weak men,

<P>who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall

<P>into thy distractions; which distractions do not only unman men,

<P>as thine, I perceive, have done thee, but they run them upon

<P>desperate ventures to obtain they know not what.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I know what I would obtain; it is ease for my heavy burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{42}

<P>&lt;Whether Mr. Worldly Wiseman prefers morality before the strait gate>

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; But why wilt thou seek for ease this way, seeing so many
dangers

<P>attend it? especially since, hadst thou but patience to hear me,

<P>I could direct thee to the obtaining of what thou desirest,

<P>without the dangers that thou in this way wilt run thyself into; yea,

<P>and the remedy is at hand.&nbsp; Besides, I will add, that instead of

<P>those dangers, thou shalt meet with much safety, friendship,

<P>and content.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, Sir, open this secret to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{43}

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Why, in yonder village--the village is named Morality--

<P>there dwells a gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious man,

<P>and a man of very good name, that has skill to help men off

<P>with such burdens as thine are from their shoulders:&nbsp; yea,

<P>to my knowledge, he hath done a great deal of good this way;

<P>ay, and besides, he hath skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed

<P>in their wits with their burdens.&nbsp; To him, as I said, thou mayest
go,

<P>and be helped presently.&nbsp; His house is not quite a mile from this
place,

<P>and if he should not be at home himself, he hath a pretty young man

<P>to his son, whose name is Civility, that can do it (to speak on)

<P>as well as the old gentleman himself; there, I say, thou mayest be

<P>eased of thy burden; and if thou art not minded to go back to

<P>thy former habitation, as, indeed, I would not wish thee,

<P>thou mayest send for thy wife and children to thee to this village,

<P>where there are houses now stand empty, one of which thou mayest have

<P>at reasonable rates; provision is there also cheap and good;

<P>and that which will make thy life the more happy is, to be sure,

<P>there thou shalt live by honest neighbours, in credit and good fashion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{44}

<P>&lt;Christian snared by Worldly Wiseman's words>

<P>Now was Christian somewhat at a stand; but presently he concluded,

<P>if this be true, which this gentleman hath said, my wisest course

<P>is to take his advice; and with that he thus further spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{45}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, which is my way to this honest man's house?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Mount Sinai>

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Do you see yonder hill?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, very well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WORLD.&nbsp; By that hill you must go, and the first house you come
at

<P>is his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{46}

<P>&lt;Christian afraid that Mount Sinai would fall on his head>

<P>So Christian turned out of his way to go to Mr. Legality's house

<P>for help; but, behold, when he was got now hard by the hill,

<P>it seemed so high, and also that side of it that was next the wayside

<P>did hang so much over, that Christian was afraid to venture further,

<P>lest the hill should fall on his head; wherefore there he stood still

<P>and wotted not what to do.&nbsp; Also his burden now seemed heavier
to him

<P>than while he was in his way.&nbsp; There came also flashes of fire

<P>out of the hill, that made Christian afraid that he should be burned.

<P>[Ex. 19:16,18]&nbsp; Here, therefore, he sweat and did quake for fear.

<P>[Heb. 12:21]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Christians unto carnal men give ear,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of their way they go, and pay for 't dear;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Master Worldly Wiseman can but shew

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A saint the way to bondage and to woe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{47}

<P>&lt;Evangelist findeth Christian under Mount Sinai, and looketh severely

<P>upon him>

<P>And now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr. Worldly Wiseman's

<P>counsel.&nbsp; And with that he saw Evangelist coming to meet him;

<P>at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame.&nbsp; So Evangelist

<P>drew nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he looked upon him

<P>with a severe and dreadful countenance, and thus began to reason

<P>with Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{48}

<P>&lt;Evangelist reasons afresh with Christian>

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; What dost thou here, Christian? said he:&nbsp; at which
words

<P>Christian knew not what to answer; wherefore at present he stood

<P>speechless before him.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist further,

<P>Art not thou the man that I found crying without the walls

<P>of the City of Destruction?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, dear Sir, I am the man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Did not I direct thee the way to the little wicket-gate?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, dear Sir, said Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; How is it, then, that thou art so quickly turned aside?

<P>for thou art now out of the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{49}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I met with a gentleman so soon as I had got over

<P>the Slough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might,

<P>in the village before me, find a man that would take off my burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; What was he?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; He looked like a gentleman, and talked much to me,

<P>and got me at last to yield; so I came hither; but when I beheld

<P>this hill, and how it hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand

<P>lest it should fall on my head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; What said that gentleman to you?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, he asked me whither I was going, and I told him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; And what said he then?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; He asked me if I had a family?&nbsp; And I told him.&nbsp;
But, said I,

<P>I am so loaden with the burden that is on my back, that I cannot

<P>take pleasure in them as formerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; And what said he then?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{50}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; He bid me with speed get rid of my burden; and I told him

<P>that it was ease that I sought.&nbsp; And said I, I am therefore going

<P>to yonder gate, to receive further direction how I may get to the place

<P>of deliverance.&nbsp; So he said that he would shew me a better way,

<P>and short, not so attended with difficulties as the way, Sir, that you

<P>set me in; which way, said he, will direct you to a gentleman's house

<P>that hath skill to take off these burdens, so I believed him,

<P>and turned out of that way into this, if haply I might be soon eased

<P>of my burden.&nbsp; But when I came to this place, and beheld things

<P>as they are, I stopped for fear (as I said) of danger:

<P>but I now know not what to do.
