<P>Now, Reader, I have told my dream to thee;

<P>See if thou canst interpret it to me,

<P>Or to thyself, or neighbour; but take heed

<P>Of misinterpreting; for that, instead

<P>Of doing good, will but thyself abuse:

<P>By misinterpreting, evil ensues.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Take heed, also, that thou be not extreme,

<P>In playing with the outside of my dream:

<P>Nor let my figure or similitude

<P>Put thee into a laughter or a feud.

<P>Leave this for boys and fools; but as for thee,

<P>Do thou the substance of my matter see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Put by the curtains, look within my veil,

<P>Turn up my metaphors, and do not fail,

<P>There, if thou seekest them, such things to find,

<P>As will be helpful to an honest mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What of my dross thou findest there, be bold

<P>To throw away, but yet preserve the gold;

<P>What if my gold be wrapped up in ore?--

<P>None throws away the apple for the core.

<P>But if thou shalt cast all away as vain,

<P>I know not but 'twill make me dream again.
