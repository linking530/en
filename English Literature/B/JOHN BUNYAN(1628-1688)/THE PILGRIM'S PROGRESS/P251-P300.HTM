<P>SAVE-ALL.&nbsp; That is bad, but we read of some that are righteous
overmuch;

<P>and such men's rigidness prevails with them to judge and condemn

<P>all but themselves.&nbsp; But, I pray, what, and how many,

<P>were the things wherein you differed?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Why, they, after their headstrong manner,

<P>conclude that it is duty to rush on their journey all weathers;

<P>and I am for waiting for wind and tide.&nbsp; They are for hazarding
all

<P>for God at a clap; and I am for taking all advantages to secure

<P>my life and estate.&nbsp; They are for holding their notions,

<P>though all other men are against them; but I am for religion in what,

<P>and so far as the times, and my safety, will bear it.&nbsp; They are
for

<P>religion when in rags and contempt; but I am for him when he walks

<P>in his golden slippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{252}

<P>HOLD-THE-WORLD.&nbsp; Ay, and hold you there still, good Mr. By-ends;

<P>for, for my part, I can count him but a fool, that, having the liberty

<P>to keep what he has, shall be so unwise as to lose it.

<P>Let us be wise as serpents; it is best to make hay when the sun shines;

<P>you see how the bee lieth still all winter, and bestirs her only

<P>when she can have profit with pleasure.&nbsp; God sends sometimes rain,

<P>and sometimes sunshine; if they be such fools to go through the first,

<P>yet let us be content to take fair weather along with us.&nbsp; For
my part,

<P>I like that religion best that will stand with the security

<P>of God's good blessings unto us; for who can imagine,

<P>that is ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed upon us

<P>the good things of this life, but that he would have us keep them

<P>for his sake?&nbsp; Abraham and Solomon grew rich in religion.

<P>And Job says, that a good man shall lay up gold as dust.

<P>But he must not be such as the men before us, if they be

<P>as you have described them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>SAVE-ALL.&nbsp; I think that we are all agreed in this matter,

<P>and therefore there needs no more words about it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MONEY-LOVE.&nbsp; No, there needs no more words about this matter,

<P>indeed; for he that believes neither Scripture nor reason

<P>(and you see we have both on our side) neither knows his own liberty,

<P>nor seeks his own safety.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{253}

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; My brethren, we are, as you see, going all on pilgrimage;

<P>and, for our better diversion from things that are bad,

<P>give me leave to propound unto you this question:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suppose a man, a minister, or a tradesman, &amp;c., should have

<P>an advantage lie before him, to get the good blessings of this life,

<P>yet so as that he can by no means come by them except,

<P>in appearance at least, he becomes extraordinarily zealous

<P>in some points of religion that he meddled not with before,

<P>may he not use these means to attain his end, and yet be

<P>a right honest man?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{254}

<P>MONEY-LOVE.&nbsp; I see the bottom of your question; and,

<P>with these gentlemen's good leave, I will endeavour to shape you

<P>an answer.&nbsp; And first, to speak to your question as it concerns

<P>a minister himself:&nbsp; Suppose a minister, a worthy man,

<P>possessed but of a very small benefice, and has in his eye a greater,

<P>more fat, and plump by far; he has also now an opportunity

<P>of getting of it, yet so as by being more studious, by preaching

<P>more frequently and zealously, and, because the temper of the people

<P>requires it, by altering of some of his principles; for my part,

<P>I see no reason but a man may do this, (provided he has a call), ay,

<P>and more a great deal besides, and yet be an honest man.&nbsp; For why--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{255}

<P>1.&nbsp; His desire of a greater benefice is lawful, (this cannot

<P>be contradicted), since it is set before him by Providence; so then,

<P>he may get it, if he can, making no question for conscience' sake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{256}

<P>2.&nbsp; Besides, his desire after that benefice makes him more studious,

<P>a more zealous preacher, &amp;c., and so makes him a better man;

<P>yea, makes him better improve his parts, which is according to

<P>the mind of God.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{257}

<P>3.&nbsp; Now, as for his complying with the temper of his people,

<P>by dissenting, to serve them, some of his principles,

<P>this argueth, (1) That he is of a self-denying, temper;

<P>(2) Of a sweet and winning deportment; and so (3) more fit

<P>for the ministerial function.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{258}

<P>4.&nbsp; I conclude, then, that a minister that changes a small for
a great,

<P>should not, for so doing, be judged as covetous; but rather,

<P>since he has improved in his parts and industry thereby,

<P>be counted as one that pursues his call, and the opportunity

<P>put into his hands to do good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{259}

<P>And now to the second part of the question, which concerns

<P>the tradesman you mentioned.&nbsp; Suppose such a one to have

<P>but a poor employ in the world, but by becoming religious,

<P>he may mend his market, perhaps get a rich wife, or more and far better

<P>customers to his shop; for my part, I see no reason but that this

<P>may be lawfully done.&nbsp; For why--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1.&nbsp; To become religious is a virtue, by what means soever

<P>a man becomes so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; Nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife, or more custom to my
shop.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3.&nbsp; Besides, the man that gets these by becoming religious, gets
that

<P>which is good, of them that are good, by becoming good himself;

<P>so then here is a good wife, and good customers, and good gain,

<P>and all these by becoming religious, which is good; therefore,

<P>to become religious, to get all these, is a good and profitable design.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{260}

<P>This answer, thus made by this Mr. Money-love to Mr. By-ends's question,

<P>was highly applauded by them all; wherefore they concluded

<P>upon the whole, that it was most wholesome and advantageous.

<P>And because, as they thought, no man was able to contradict it,

<P>and because Christian and Hopeful were yet within call,

<P>they jointly agreed to assault them with the question as soon

<P>as they overtook them; and the rather because they had opposed

<P>Mr. By-ends before.&nbsp; So they called after them, and they stopped,

<P>and stood still till they came up to them; but they concluded,

<P>as they went, that not Mr. By-ends, but old Mr. Hold-the-world,

<P>should propound the question to them, because, as they supposed,

<P>their answer to him would be without the remainder of that heat

<P>that was kindled betwixt Mr. By-ends and them, at their parting

<P>a little before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{260}

<P>So they came up to each other, and after a short salutation,

<P>Mr. Hold-the-world propounded the question to Christian and his fellow,

<P>and bid them to answer it if they could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Even a babe in religion may answer

<P>ten thousand such questions.&nbsp; For if it be unlawful to follow Christ

<P>for loaves, (as it is in the sixth of John), how much more

<P>abominable is it to make of him and religion a stalking-horse

<P>to get and enjoy the world!&nbsp; Nor do we find any other than heathens,

<P>hypocrites, devils, and witches, that are of this opinion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{261}

<P>1.&nbsp; Heathens; for when Hamor and Shechem had a mind to the daughter

<P>and cattle of Jacob, and saw that there was no way for them

<P>to come at them, but by becoming circumcised, they say

<P>to their companions, If every male of us be circumcised,

<P>as they are circumcised, shall not their cattle, and their substance,

<P>and every beast of theirs, be ours?&nbsp; Their daughter and their cattle

<P>were that which they sought to obtain, and their religion

<P>the stalking-horse they made use of to come at them.

<P>Read the whole story.&nbsp; [Gen. 34:20-23]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{262}

<P>2.&nbsp; The hypocritical Pharisees were also of this religion;

<P>long prayers were their pretence, but to get widows' houses

<P>was their intent; and greater damnation was from God their judgment.

<P>[Luke 20:46-47]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{263}

<P>3.&nbsp; Judas the devil was also of this religion; he was religious

<P>for the bag, that he might be possessed of what was therein;

<P>but he was lost, cast away, and the very son of perdition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{264}

<P>4.&nbsp; Simon the witch was of this religion too; for he would have
had

<P>the Holy Ghost, that he might have got money therewith;

<P>and his sentence from Peter's mouth was according.&nbsp; [Acts 8:19-22]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{265}

<P>5.&nbsp; Neither will it out of my mind, but that that man that

<P>takes up religion for the world, will throw away religion for the world;

<P>for so surely as Judas resigned the world in becoming religious,

<P>so surely did he also sell religion and his Master for the same.

<P>To answer the question, therefore, affirmatively, as I perceive

<P>you have done, and to accept of, as authentic, such answer,

<P>is both heathenish, hypocritical, and devilish; and your reward will
be

<P>according to your works.&nbsp; Then they stood staring one upon another,

<P>but had not wherewith to answer Christian.&nbsp; Hopeful also approved
of

<P>the soundness of Christian's answer; so there was a great silence

<P>among them.&nbsp; Mr. By-ends and his company also staggered and kept
behind,

<P>that Christian and Hopeful might outgo them.&nbsp; Then said Christian

<P>to his fellow, If these men cannot stand before the sentence of men,

<P>what will they do with the sentence of God?&nbsp; And if they are mute

<P>when dealt with by vessels of clay, what will they do when they shall
be

<P>rebuked by the flames of a devouring fire?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{266}

<P>&lt;The ease that pilgrims have is but little in this life>

<P>Then Christian and Hopeful outwent them again, and went till they came

<P>to a delicate plain called Ease, where they went with much content;

<P>but that plain was but narrow, so they were quickly got over it.

<P>&lt;Lucre Hill a dangerous hill>&nbsp; Now at the further side of that
plain

<P>was a little hill called Lucre, and in that hill a silver mine,

<P>which some of them that had formerly gone that way,

<P>because of the rarity of it, had turned aside to see; but going too
near

<P>the brink of the pit, the ground being deceitful under them, broke,

<P>and they were slain; some also had been maimed there, and could not,

<P>to their dying day, be their own men again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{267}

<P>&lt;Demas at the Hill Lucre.&nbsp; He calls to Christian and Hopeful

<P>to come to him>

<P>Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road,

<P>over against the silver mine, stood Demas (gentlemanlike)

<P>to call to passengers to come and see; who said to Christian

<P>and his fellow, Ho! turn aside hither, and I will show you a thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; What thing so deserving as to turn us out of the way to see
it?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Here is a silver mine, and some digging in it for treasure.

<P>If you will come, with a little pains you may richly provide

<P>for yourselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{268}

<P>&lt;Hopeful tempted to go, but Christian holds him back>

<P>Hope. Then said Hopeful, Let us go see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Not I, said Christian, I have heard of this place before
now;

<P>and how many have there been slain; and besides that,

<P>treasure is a snare to those that seek it; for it hindereth them

<P>in their pilgrimage.&nbsp; Then Christian called to Demas, saying,

<P>Is not the place dangerous?&nbsp; Hath it not hindered many

<P>in their pilgrimage?&nbsp; [Hos. 14:8]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Not very dangerous, except to those that are careless,

<P>(but withal, he blushed as he spake).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to Hopeful, Let us not stir a step,

<P>but still keep on our way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I will warrant you, when By-ends comes up, if he hath

<P>the same invitation as we, he will turn in thither to see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; No doubt thereof, for his principles lead him that way,

<P>and a hundred to one but he dies there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Then Demas called again, saying, But will you not

<P>come over and see?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{269}

<P>&lt;Christian roundeth up Demas>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then Christian roundly answered, saying, Demas,

<P>thou art an enemy to the right ways of the Lord of this way,

<P>and hast been already condemned for thine own turning aside,

<P>by one of His Majesty's judges [2 Tim. 4:10]; and why seekest thou

<P>to bring us into the like condemnation?&nbsp; Besides, if we at all

<P>turn aside, our Lord and King will certainly hear thereof,

<P>and will there put us to shame, where we would stand with boldness

<P>before him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Demas cried again, that he also was one of their fraternity;

<P>and that if they would tarry a little, he also himself

<P>would walk with them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{270}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What is thy name?&nbsp; Is it not the
same

<P>by the which I have called thee?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Yes, my name is Demas; I am the son of Abraham.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I know you; Gehazi was your great-grandfather,

<P>and Judas your father; and you have trod in their steps.

<P>[2 Kings 5:20, Matt. 26:14,15, 27:1-5]&nbsp; It is but a devilish prank

<P>that thou usest; thy father was hanged for a traitor,

<P>and thou deservest no better reward.&nbsp; Assure thyself,

<P>that when we come to the King, we will do him word of this

<P>thy behaviour.&nbsp; Thus they went their way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{271}

<P>&lt;By-ends goes over to Demas>

<P>By this time By-ends and his companions were come again within sight,

<P>and they, at the first beck, went over to Demas.&nbsp; Now,

<P>whether they fell into the pit by looking over the brink thereof,

<P>or whether they went down to dig, or whether they were smothered

<P>in the bottom by the damps that commonly arise, of these things

<P>I am not certain; but this I observed, that they never were seen again

<P>in the way.&nbsp; Then sang Christian--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By-ends and silver Demas both agree;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One calls, the other runs, that he may be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharer in his lucre; so these do

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take up in this world, and no further go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{272}

<P>&lt;They see a strange monument>

<P>Now I saw that, just on the other side of this plain,

<P>the pilgrims came to a place where stood an old monument,

<P>hard by the highway side, at the sight of which they were

<P>both concerned, because of the strangeness of the form thereof;

<P>for it seemed to them as if it had been a woman transformed

<P>into the shape of a pillar; here, therefore they stood looking,

<P>and looking upon it, but could not for a time tell what

<P>they should make thereof.&nbsp; At last Hopeful espied written above

<P>the head thereof, a writing in an unusual hand; but he being no scholar,

<P>called to Christian (for he was learned) to see if he could pick out

<P>the meaning; so he came, and after a little laying of letters together,

<P>he found the same to be this, "Remember Lot's Wife".&nbsp; So he read
it

<P>to his fellow; after which they both concluded that that was

<P>the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was turned,

<P>for her looking back with a covetous heart, when she was going

<P>from Sodom for safety.&nbsp; [Gen. 19:26]&nbsp;&nbsp; Which sudden and
amazing sight

<P>gave them occasion of this discourse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{273}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ah, my brother! this is a seasonable sight;

<P>it came opportunely to us after the invitation which Demas gave us

<P>to come over to view the Hill Lucre; and had we gone over,

<P>as he desired us, and as thou wast inclining to do, my brother,

<P>we had, for aught I know, been made ourselves like this woman,

<P>a spectacle for those that shall come after to behold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I am sorry that I was so foolish, and am made to wonder

<P>that I am not now as Lot's wife; for wherein was the difference betwixt

<P>her sin and mine?&nbsp; She only looked back; and I had a desire to
go see.

<P>Let grace be adored, and let me be ashamed that ever such a thing

<P>should be in mine heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{274}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Let us take notice of what we see here, for our help

<P>for time to come.&nbsp; This woman escaped one judgment,

<P>for she fell not by the destruction of Sodom; yet she was destroyed

<P>by another, as we see she is turned into a pillar of salt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; True; and she may be to us both caution and example;

<P>caution, that we should shun her sin; or a sign of what judgment

<P>will overtake such as shall not be prevented by this caution;

<P>so Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with the two hundred and fifty men

<P>that perished in their sin, did also become a sign or example to others

<P>to beware.&nbsp; [Num. 26:9,10]&nbsp; But above all, I muse at one thing,
to wit,

<P>how Demas and his fellows can stand so confidently yonder to look for

<P>that treasure, which this woman, but for looking behind her after,

<P>(for we read not that she stepped one foot out of the way) was turned

<P>into a pillar of salt; especially since the judgment which overtook
her

<P>did make her an example, within sight of where they are;

<P>for they cannot choose but see her, did they but lift up their eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{275}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; It is a thing to be wondered at, and it argueth that

<P>their hearts are grown desperate in the case; and I cannot tell who

<P>to compare them to so fitly, as to them that pick pockets

<P>in the presence of the judge, or that will cut purses under the gallows.

<P>It is said of the men of Sodom, that they were sinners exceedingly,

<P>because they were sinners before the Lord, that is, in his eyesight,

<P>and notwithstanding the kindnesses that he had showed them [Gen. 13:13];

<P>for the land of Sodom was now like the garden of Eden heretofore.

<P>[Gen. 13:10]&nbsp; This, therefore, provoked him the more to jealousy,

<P>and made their plague as hot as the fire of the Lord out of heaven

<P>could make it.&nbsp; And it is most rationally to be concluded, that
such,

<P>even such as these are, that shall sin in the sight, yea,

<P>and that too in despite of such examples that are set continually

<P>before them, to caution them to the contrary, must be partakers

<P>of severest judgments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Doubtless thou hast said the truth; but what a mercy is
it,

<P>that neither thou, but especially I, am not made myself this example!

<P>This ministereth occasion to us to thank God, to fear before him,

<P>and always to remember Lot's wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{276}

<P>&lt;A river>

<P>I saw, then, that they went on their way to a pleasant river;

<P>which David the king called "the river of God", but John,

<P>"the river of the water of life".&nbsp; [Ps. 65:9, Rev. 22, Ezek. 47]

<P>Now their way lay just upon the bank of the river; here, therefore,

<P>Christian and his companion walked with great delight;

<P>they drank also of the water of the river, which was pleasant,

<P>and enlivening to their weary spirits:&nbsp; &lt;Trees by the river.

<P>The fruit and leaves of the tree> besides, on the banks of this river,

<P>on either side, were green trees, that bore all manner of fruit;

<P>and the leaves of the trees were good for medicine;

<P>with the fruit of these trees they were also much delighted;

<P>and the leaves they eat to prevent surfeits, and other diseases

<P>that are incident to those that heat their blood by travels.

<P>&lt;A meadow in which they lie down to sleep>&nbsp; On either side of
the river

<P>was also a meadow, curiously beautified with lilies, and it was green

<P>all the year long.&nbsp; In this meadow they lay down, and slept;

<P>for here they might lie down safely.&nbsp; When they awoke,

<P>they gathered again of the fruit of the trees, and drank again

<P>of the water of the river, and then lay down again to sleep.

<P>[Ps. 23:2, Isa. 14:30]&nbsp; Thus they did several days and nights.

<P>Then they sang--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold ye how these crystal streams do
glide,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To comfort pilgrims by the highway side;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meadows green, beside their fragrant
smell,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yield dainties for them; and he that
can tell

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when they were disposed to go on, (for they were not, as yet,

<P>at their journey's end,) they ate and drank, and departed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{277}

<P>&lt;By-path Meadow>

<P>Now, I beheld in my dream, that they had not journeyed far,

<P>but the river and the way for a time parted; at which they were not

<P>a little sorry; yet they durst not go out of the way.

<P>Now the way from the river was rough, and their feet tender,

<P>by reason of their travels; so the souls of the pilgrims

<P>were much discouraged because of the way.&nbsp; [Num. 21:4]&nbsp; Wherefore,

<P>still as they went on, they wished for better way.&nbsp; Now,

<P>a little before them, there was on the left hand of the road a meadow,

<P>and a stile to go over into it; and that meadow is called

<P>By-path Meadow.&nbsp; &lt;One temptation does make way for another>&nbsp;
Then said

<P>Christian to his fellow, If this meadow lieth along by our wayside,

<P>let us go over into it.&nbsp; Then he went to the stile to see, and
behold,

<P>a path lay along by the way, on the other side of the fence.

<P>It is according to my wish, said Christian.&nbsp; Here is the easiest
going;

<P>come, good Hopeful, and let us go over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{278}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But how if this path should lead us out of the way?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Strong Christians may lead weak ones out of the way>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is not like, said the other.&nbsp; Look, doth it not
go along

<P>by the wayside?&nbsp; So Hopeful, being persuaded by his fellow,

<P>went after him over the stile.&nbsp; &lt;See what it is too suddenly

<P>to fall in with strangers>&nbsp; When they were gone over,

<P>and were got into the path, they found it very easy for their feet;

<P>and withal, they, looking before them, espied a man walking as they
did,

<P>(and his name was Vain-confidence); so they called after him,

<P>and asked him whither that way led.&nbsp; He said, To the Celestial
Gate.

<P>Look, said Christian, did not I tell you so?&nbsp; By this you may see

<P>we are right.&nbsp; So they followed, and he went before them.

<P>But, behold, the night came on, and it grew very dark;

<P>so that they that were behind lost the sight of him that went before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{279}

<P>&lt;A pit to catch the vain-glorious in>

<P>He, therefore, that went before, (Vain-confidence by name),

<P>not seeing the way before him, fell into a deep pit [Isa. 9:16],

<P>which was on purpose there made, by the Prince of those grounds,

<P>to catch vain-glorious fools withal, and was dashed in pieces

<P>with his fall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{280}

<P>&lt;Reasoning between Christian and Hopeful>

<P>Now Christian and his fellow heard him fall.&nbsp; So they called to
know

<P>the matter, but there was none to answer, only they heard a groaning.

<P>Then said Hopeful, Where are we now?&nbsp; Then was his fellow silent,

<P>as mistrusting that he had led him out of the way; and now it began

<P>to rain, and thunder, and lighten in a very dreadful manner;

<P>and the water rose amain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then Hopeful groaned in himself, saying, Oh, that I had kept on my way!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{281}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Who could have thought that this path should have led us

<P>out of the way?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I was afraid on it at the very first, and therefore gave
you

<P>that gentle caution.&nbsp; I would have spoken plainer, but that you

<P>are older than I.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Christian's repentance for leading of his brother out of the way>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Good brother, be not offended; I am sorry I have brought
thee

<P>out of the way, and that I have put thee into such imminent danger;

<P>pray, my brother, forgive me; I did not do it of an evil intent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Be comforted, my brother, for I forgive thee; and believe,
too,

<P>that this shall be for our good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am glad I have with me a merciful brother; but we must
not

<P>stand thus: let us try to go back again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But, good brother, let me go before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; No, if you please, let me go first, that if there be any
danger,

<P>I may be first therein, because by my means we are both gone out

<P>of the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{282}

<P>&lt;They are in danger of drowning as they go back>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; No, said Hopeful, you shall not go first; for your mind

<P>being troubled may lead you out of the way again.&nbsp; Then,

<P>for their encouragement, they heard the voice of one saying,

<P>"Set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest;

<P>turn again."&nbsp; [Jer. 31:21]&nbsp; But by this time the waters

<P>were greatly risen, by reason of which the way of going back

<P>was very dangerous.&nbsp; (Then I thought that it is easier going out

<P>of the way, when we are in, than going in when we are out.)

<P>Yet they adventured to go back, but it was so dark,

<P>and the flood was so high, that in their going back they had like

<P>to have been drowned nine or ten times.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{283}

<P>&lt;They sleep in the grounds of Giant Despair>

<P>Neither could they, with all the skill they had, get again to the stile

<P>that night.&nbsp; Wherefore, at last, lighting under a little shelter,

<P>they sat down there until the daybreak; but, being weary,

<P>they fell asleep.&nbsp; &lt;He finds them in his grounds, and carries
them

<P>to Doubting Castle>&nbsp; Now there was, not far from the place

<P>where they lay, a castle called Doubting Castle, the owner whereof

<P>was Giant Despair; and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping:

<P>wherefore he, getting up in the morning early, and walking up and down

<P>in his fields, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds.

<P>Then, with a grim and surly voice, he bid them awake; and asked them

<P>whence they were, and what they did in his grounds.&nbsp; They told
him

<P>they were pilgrims, and that they had lost their way.

<P>Then said the Giant, You have this night trespassed on me,

<P>by trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore you must go along

<P>with me.&nbsp; So they were forced to go, because he was stronger than
they.

<P>They also had but little to say, for they knew themselves in a fault.

<P>&lt;The grievousness of their imprisonment>&nbsp; The Giant, therefore,

<P>drove them before him, and put them into his castle,

<P>into a very dark dungeon, nasty and stinking to the spirits of these

<P>two men.&nbsp; [Ps. 88:18]&nbsp; Here, then, they lay from Wednesday
morning

<P>till Saturday night, without one bit of bread, or drop of drink,

<P>or light, or any to ask how they did; they were, therefore,

<P>here in evil case, and were far from friends and acquaintance.

<P>Now in this place Christian had double sorrow, because it was through

<P>his unadvised counsel that they were brought into this distress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilgrims now, to gratify the flesh,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will seek its ease; but oh! how they afresh

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do thereby plunge themselves new griefs into!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who seek to please the flesh, themselves undo.

<P>{284}

<P>&lt;On Thursday, Giant Despair beats his prisoners>

<P>Now, Giant Despair had a wife, and her name was Diffidence.

<P>So when he was gone to bed, he told his wife what he had done; to wit,

<P>that he had taken a couple of prisoners and cast them into his dungeon,

<P>for trespassing on his grounds.&nbsp; Then he asked her also what he

<P>had best to do further to them.&nbsp; So she asked him what they were,

<P>whence they came, and whither they were bound; and he told her.

<P>Then she counselled him that when he arose in the morning

<P>he should beat them without any mercy.&nbsp; So, when he arose,

<P>he getteth him a grievous crab-tree cudgel, and goes down into

<P>the dungeon to them, and there first falls to rating of them

<P>as if they were dogs, although they never gave him a word of distaste.

<P>Then he falls upon them, and beats them fearfully, in such sort that

<P>they were not able to help themselves, or to turn them upon the floor.

<P>This done, he withdraws and leaves them there to condole their misery

<P>and to mourn under their distress.&nbsp; So all that day they spent
the time

<P>in nothing but sighs and bitter lamentations.&nbsp; The next night,
she,

<P>talking with her husband about them further, and understanding they
were

<P>yet alive, did advise him to counsel them to make away themselves.

<P>&lt;On Friday, Giant Despair counsels them to kill themselves>

<P>So when morning was come, he goes to them in a surly manner as before,

<P>and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes that he had

<P>given them the day before, he told them, that since they were

<P>never like to come out of that place, their only way would be forthwith

<P>to make an end of themselves, either with knife, halter, or poison,

<P>for why, said he, should you choose life, seeing it is attended

<P>with so much bitterness?&nbsp; But they desired him to let them go.

<P>&lt;The giant sometimes has fits>&nbsp; With that he looked ugly upon
them,

<P>and, rushing to them, had doubtless made an end of them himself,

<P>but that he fell into one of his fits, (for he sometimes,

<P>in sunshiny weather, fell into fits), and lost for a time the use

<P>of his hand; wherefore he withdrew, and left them as before, to consider

<P>what to do.&nbsp; Then did the prisoners consult between themselves

<P>whether it was best to take his counsel or no; and thus they began

<P>to discourse:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{285}

<P>&lt;Christian crushed>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Brother, said Christian, what shall we do?&nbsp; The life
that

<P>we now live is miserable.&nbsp; For my part I know not whether is best,

<P>to live thus, or to die out of hand.&nbsp; "My soul chooseth strangling

<P>rather than life", and the grave is more easy for me than this dungeon.

<P>[Job 7:15]&nbsp; Shall we be ruled by the Giant?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{286}

<P>&lt;Hopeful comforts him>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Indeed, our present condition is dreadful, and death would
be

<P>far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide; but yet,

<P>let us consider, the Lord of the country to which we are going

<P>hath said, Thou shalt do no murder:&nbsp; no, not to another man's person;

<P>much more, then, are we forbidden to take his counsel to kill ourselves.

<P>Besides, he that kills another, can but commit murder upon his body;

<P>but for one to kill himself is to kill body and soul at once.

<P>And, moreover, my brother, thou talkest of ease in the grave;

<P>but hast thou forgotten the hell, for certain the murderers go?

<P>"For no murderer hath eternal life," &amp;c.&nbsp; And let us consider,
again,

<P>that all the law is not in the hand of Giant Despair.&nbsp; Others,

<P>so far as I can understand, have been taken by him, as well as we;

<P>and yet have escaped out of his hand.&nbsp; Who knows, but the God

<P>that made the world may cause that Giant Despair may die? or that,

<P>at some time or other, he may forget to lock us in? or that he may,

<P>in a short time, have another of his fits before us, and may lose

<P>the use of his limbs? and if ever that should come to pass again,

<P>for my part, I am resolved to pluck up the heart of a man,

<P>and to try my utmost to get from under his hand.&nbsp; I was a fool

<P>that I did not try to do it before; but, however, my brother,

<P>let us be patient, and endure a while.&nbsp; The time may come

<P>that may give us a happy release; but let us not be our own murderers.

<P>With these words Hopeful at present did moderate the mind

<P>of his brother; so they continued together (in the dark) that day,

<P>in their sad and doleful condition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{287}

<P>Well, towards evening, the Giant goes down into the dungeon again,

<P>to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel; but when he came there

<P>he found them alive; and truly, alive was all; for now,

<P>what for want of bread and water, and by reason of the wounds

<P>they received when he beat them, they could do little but breathe.

<P>But, I say, he found them alive; at which he fell into a grievous rage,

<P>and told them that, seeing they had disobeyed his counsel,

<P>it should be worse with them than if they had never been born.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{288}

<P>&lt;Christian still dejected>

<P>At this they trembled greatly, and I think that Christian

<P>fell into a swoon; but, coming a little to himself again,

<P>they renewed their discourse about the Giant's counsel; and whether
yet

<P>they had best to take it or no.&nbsp; Now Christian again seemed to
be

<P>for doing it, but Hopeful made his second reply as followeth:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{289}

<P>&lt;Hopeful comforts him again, by calling former things to remembrance>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; My brother, said he, rememberest thou not how valiant

<P>thou hast been heretofore?&nbsp; Apollyon could not crush thee,

<P>nor could all that thou didst hear, or see, or feel,

<P>in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.&nbsp; What hardship, terror,

<P>and amazement hast thou already gone through!&nbsp; And art thou now

<P>nothing but fear!&nbsp; Thou seest that I am in the dungeon with thee,

<P>a far weaker man by nature than thou art; also, this Giant has wounded

<P>me as well as thee, and hath also cut off the bread and water

<P>from my mouth; and with thee I mourn without the light.

<P>But let us exercise a little more patience; remember how thou

<P>playedst the man at Vanity Fair, and wast neither afraid of the chain,

<P>nor cage, nor yet of bloody death.&nbsp; Wherefore let us (at least

<P>to avoid the shame, that becomes not a Christian to be found in)

<P>bear up with patience as well as we can.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{290}

<P>Now, night being come again, and the Giant and his wife being in bed,

<P>she asked him concerning the prisoners, and if they had taken

<P>his counsel.&nbsp; To which he replied, They are sturdy rogues,

<P>they choose rather to bear all hardship, than to make away themselves.

<P>Then said she, Take them into the castle-yard to-morrow, and show them

<P>the bones and skulls of those that thou hast already despatched,

<P>and make them believe, ere a week comes to an end, thou also wilt

<P>tear them in pieces, as thou hast done their fellows before them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{291}

<P>&lt;On Saturday, the Giant threatened that shortly he would

<P>pull them in pieces>

<P>So when the morning was come, the Giant goes to them again,

<P>and takes them into the castle-yard, and shows them, as his wife

<P>had bidden him.&nbsp; These, said he, were pilgrims as you are, once,

<P>and they trespassed in my grounds, as you have done;

<P>and when I thought fit, I tore them in pieces, and so, within ten days,

<P>I will do you. Go, get you down to your den again; and with that

<P>he beat them all the way thither.&nbsp; They lay, therefore,

<P>all day on Saturday in a lamentable case, as before.&nbsp; Now,

<P>when night was come, and when Mrs. Diffidence and her husband,

<P>the Giant, were got to bed, they began to renew their discourse

<P>of their prisoners; and withal the old Giant wondered,

<P>that he could neither by his blows nor his counsel bring them to an
end.

<P>And with that his wife replied, I fear, said she, that they live in
hope

<P>that some will come to relieve them, or that they have picklocks

<P>about them, by the means of which they hope to escape.

<P>And sayest thou so, my dear? said the Giant; I will, therefore,

<P>search them in the morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{292}

<P>Well, on Saturday, about midnight, they began to pray,

<P>and continued in prayer till almost break of day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;A key in Christian's bosom, called Promise, opens any lock

<P>in Doubting Castle>

<P>Now, a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed,

<P>brake out in this passionate speech:--&nbsp; What a fool, quoth he,
am I,

<P>thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty!

<P>I have a key in my bosom, called Promise, that will, I am persuaded,

<P>open any lock in Doubting Castle.&nbsp; Then said Hopeful,

<P>That is good news, good brother; pluck it out of thy bosom, and try.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{293}

<P>Then Christian pulled it out of his bosom, and began to try

<P>at the dungeon door, whose bolt (as he turned the key) gave back,

<P>and the door flew open with ease, and Christian and Hopeful

<P>both came out.&nbsp; Then he went to the outward door that leads into

<P>the castle-yard, and, with his key, opened that door also.

<P>After, he went to the iron gate, for that must be opened too;

<P>but that lock went damnable hard, yet the key did open it.

<P>Then they thrust open the gate to make their escape with speed,

<P>but that gate, as it opened, made such a creaking, that it waked

<P>Giant Despair, who, hastily rising to pursue his prisoners,

<P>felt his limbs to fail, for his fits took him again,

<P>so that he could by no means go after them.&nbsp; Then they went on,

<P>and came to the King's highway, and so were safe, because they were

<P>out of his jurisdiction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{294}

<P>&lt;A pillar erected by Christian and his fellow>

<P>Now, when they were over the stile, they began to contrive

<P>with themselves what they should do at that stile to prevent those

<P>that should come after from falling into the hands of Giant Despair.

<P>So they consented to erect there a pillar, and to engrave upon

<P>the side thereof this sentence--"Over this stile is the way

<P>to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair,

<P>who despiseth the King of the Celestial Country, and seeks to destroy

<P>his holy pilgrims."&nbsp; Many, therefore, that followed after

<P>read what was written, and escaped the danger.&nbsp; This done,

<P>they sang as follows:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the way we went, and then we found

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What 'twas to tread upon forbidden ground;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let them that come after have a care,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest heedlessness makes them, as we, to fare.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest they for trespassing his prisoners are,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose castle's Doubting, and whose name's Despair.

<P>&lt;The Delectable Mountains>

<P>They went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains,

<P>which mountains belong to the Lord of that hill of which

<P>we have spoken before; so they went up to the mountains,

<P>to behold the gardens and orchards, the vineyards and fountains

<P>of water; where also they drank and washed themselves,

<P>and did freely eat of the vineyards.&nbsp; &lt;They are refreshed

<P>in the mountains>&nbsp; Now there were on the tops of these mountains

<P>Shepherds feeding their flocks, and they stood by the highway side.

<P>&lt;Talk with the Shepherds>&nbsp; The Pilgrims therefore went to them,

<P>and leaning upon their staves, (as is common with weary pilgrims

<P>when they stand to talk with any by the way), they asked,

<P>Whose Delectable Mountains are these?&nbsp; And whose be the sheep

<P>that feed upon them?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountains delectable they now ascend,

<P>&lt;The Shepherds welcome them>

<P>I saw also in my dream, that when the Shepherds perceived

<P>to which they made answer as in other places; as, Whence came you?

<P>and, How got you into the way? and, By what means have you

<P>so persevered therein?&nbsp; For but few of them that begin to come
hither

<P>do show their face on these mountains.&nbsp; But when the Shepherds
heard

<P>They said, moreover, We would that ye should stay here awhile,

<P>to be acquainted with us; and yet more to solace yourselves

<P>with the good of these Delectable Mountains.&nbsp; They then told them,

<P>&lt;They are shown wonders>

<P>Then I saw in my dream, that in the morning the Shepherds called up

<P>to Christian and Hopeful to walk with them upon the mountains;

<P>so they went forth with them, and walked a while,

<P>having a pleasant prospect on every side.&nbsp; Then said the Shepherds

<P>one to another, Shall we show these pilgrims some wonders?

<P>&lt;The Mountain of Error>&nbsp; So when they had concluded to do it,

<P>they had them first to the top of a hill called Error,

<P>which was very steep on the furthest side, and bid them look down

<P>to the bottom.&nbsp; So Christian and Hopeful looked down,

<P>and saw at the bottom several men dashed all to pieces by a fall

<P>that they had from the top.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What meaneth
this?

<P>The Shepherds answered, Have you not heard of them that were made to
err

<P>by hearkening to Hymeneus and Philetus as concerning the faith

<P>of the resurrection of the body?&nbsp; [2 Tim. 2:17,18]&nbsp; They answered,
Yes.

<P>Then said the Shepherds, Those that you see lie dashed in pieces

<P>at the bottom of this mountain are they; and they have continued

<P>to this day unburied, as you see, for an example to others

<P>to take heed how they clamber too high, or how they come too near

<P>the brink of this mountain.

<P>&lt;Mount Caution>

<P>Then I saw that they had them to the top of another mountain,

<P>and the name of that is Caution, and bid them look afar off;

<P>which, when they did, they perceived, as they thought,

<P>several men walking up and down among the tombs that were there;

<P>and they perceived that the men were blind, because they

<P>stumbled sometimes upon the tombs, and because they could not get out

<P>from among them.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What means this?
