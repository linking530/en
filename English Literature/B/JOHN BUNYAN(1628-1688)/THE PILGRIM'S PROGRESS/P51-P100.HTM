<P>&lt;Evangelist convinces Christian of his error>

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Then, said Evangelist, stand still a little, that I may
show thee

<P>the words of God.&nbsp; So he stood trembling.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist,

<P>"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.&nbsp; For if they escaped
not

<P>who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape,

<P>if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven."&nbsp; [Heb. 12:25]

<P>He said, moreover, "Now the just shall live by faith:&nbsp; but if any
man

<P>draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."&nbsp; [Heb. 10:38]

<P>He also did thus apply them:&nbsp; Thou art the man that art running
into

<P>this misery; thou hast begun to reject the counsel of the Most High,

<P>and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even almost

<P>to the hazarding of thy perdition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{52}

<P>Then Christian fell down at his feet as dead, crying, "Woe is me,

<P>for I am undone!"&nbsp; At the sight of which Evangelist caught him

<P>by the right hand, saying, "All manner of sin and blasphemies

<P>shall be forgiven unto men." [Matt. 12:31, Mark 3:28]

<P>"Be not faithless, but believing."&nbsp; [John 20:27]&nbsp; Then did
Christian

<P>again a little revive, and stood up trembling, as at first,

<P>before Evangelist.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{53}

<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman described by Evangelist>

<P>Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed

<P>to the things that I shall tell thee of.&nbsp; I will now show thee

<P>who it was that deluded thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee.

<P>--The man that met thee is one Worldly Wiseman, and rightly is he

<P>so called; partly, because he savoureth only the doctrine of this world,

<P>[1 John 4:5] (therefore he always goes to the town of Morality

<P>to church):&nbsp; and partly because he loveth that doctrine best,

<P>for it saveth him best from the cross.&nbsp; [Gal 6:12]&nbsp; And because

<P>he is of this carnal temper, therefore he seeketh to pervert my ways,

<P>though right.&nbsp; Now there are three things in this man's counsel,

<P>that thou must utterly abhor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Evangelist discovers the deceit of Mr. Worldly Wiseman>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1.&nbsp; His turning thee out of the way.

<P>2.&nbsp; His labouring to render the cross odious to thee.&nbsp; And,

<P>3.&nbsp; His setting thy feet in that way that leadeth unto

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the administration of death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{54}

<P>First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way;

<P>and thine own consenting thereunto:&nbsp; because this is to reject

<P>the counsel of God for the sake of the counsel of a Worldly Wiseman.

<P>The Lord says, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate" [Luke 13:24],

<P>the gate to which I sent thee; for "strait is the gate that leadeth

<P>unto life, and few there be that find it." [Matt. 7:14]

<P>From this little wicket-gate, and from the way thereto,

<P>hath this wicked man turned thee, to the bringing of thee

<P>almost to destruction; hate, therefore, his turning thee out of the
way,

<P>and abhor thyself for hearkening to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{55}

<P>Secondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the cross

<P>odious unto thee; for thou art to prefer it "before the treasures

<P>in Egypt."&nbsp; [Heb. 11:25,26]&nbsp; Besides the King of glory hath
told thee,

<P>that he that "will save his life shall lose it."&nbsp; [Mark 8:35;

<P>John 12:25; Matt. 10:39]&nbsp; And, "He that cometh after me,

<P>and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,

<P>and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also,

<P>he cannot be my disciple."&nbsp; [Luke 14:26]&nbsp; I say, therefore,

<P>for man to labour to persuade thee, that that shall be thy death,

<P>without which, THE TRUTH hath said, thou canst not have eternal life;

<P>this doctrine thou must abhor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{56}

<P>Thirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way that leadeth

<P>to the ministration of death.&nbsp; And for this thou must consider
to whom

<P>he sent thee, and also how unable that person was to deliver thee

<P>from thy burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{57}

<P>&lt;The bond-woman>

<P>He to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by name Legality,

<P>is the son of the bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage

<P>with her children [Gal 4:21-27]; and is, in a mystery, this Mount Sinai,

<P>which thou hast feared will fall on thy head.&nbsp; Now, if she,

<P>with her children, are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them

<P>to be made free?&nbsp; This Legality, therefore, is not able to set
thee free

<P>from thy burden.&nbsp; No man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him;
no,

<P>nor ever is like to be:&nbsp; ye cannot be justified by the works of
the law;

<P>for by the deeds of the law no man living can be rid of his burden:

<P>therefore, Mr. Worldly Wiseman is an alien, and Mr. Legality is a cheat;

<P>and for his son Civility, notwithstanding his simpering looks,

<P>he is but a hypocrite and cannot help thee.&nbsp; Believe me,

<P>there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast heard of these

<P>sottish men, but a design to beguile thee of thy salvation,

<P>by turning thee from the way in which I had set thee.&nbsp; After this,

<P>Evangelist called aloud to the heavens for confirmation of what

<P>he had said:&nbsp; and with that there came words and fire

<P>out of the mountain under which poor Christian stood, that made

<P>the hair of his flesh stand up.&nbsp; The words were thus pronounced:

<P>`As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse;

<P>for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things

<P>which are written in the book of the law to do them.'&nbsp; [Gal. 3:10]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{58}

<P>Now Christian looked for nothing but death, and began

<P>to cry out lamentably; even cursing the time in which he met

<P>with Mr. Worldly Wiseman; still calling himself a thousand fools

<P>for hearkening to his counsel; he also was greatly ashamed to think

<P>that this gentleman's arguments, flowing only from the flesh,

<P>should have the prevalency with him as to cause him to forsake

<P>the right way.&nbsp; This done, he applied himself again to Evangelist

<P>in words and sense as follow:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{59}

<P>&lt;Christian inquires if he may yet be happy>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, what think you?&nbsp; Is there hope?&nbsp; May I now
go back

<P>and go up to the wicket-gate?&nbsp; Shall I not be abandoned for this,

<P>and sent back from thence ashamed?&nbsp; I am sorry I have hearkened
to

<P>this man's counsel.&nbsp; But may my sin be forgiven?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Evangelist comforts him>

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist to him, Thy sin is very great,

<P>for by it thou hast committed two evils:&nbsp; thou hast forsaken the
way

<P>that is good, to tread in forbidden paths; yet will the man at the gate

<P>receive thee, for he has goodwill for men; only, said he,

<P>take heed that thou turn not aside again, `lest thou perish from

<P>the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.'&nbsp; [Ps. 2:12]

<P>Then did Christian address himself to go back; and Evangelist,

<P>after he had kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God-speed.

<P>So he went on with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way;

<P>nor, if any asked him, would he vouchsafe them an answer.

<P>He went like one that was all the while treading on forbidden ground,

<P>and could by no means think himself safe, till again he was got

<P>into the way which he left, to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel.

<P>So, in process of time, Christian got up to the gate.

<P>Now, over the gate there was written, `Knock, and it shall be opened

<P>unto you.' [Matt 7:8]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{60}

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He that will enter in must first without

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand knocking at the Gate, nor need he doubt

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is A KNOCKER but to enter in;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For God can love him, and forgive his sin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May I now enter here?&nbsp; Will he within

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open to sorry me, though I have been

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An undeserving rebel?&nbsp; Then shall I

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last there came a grave person to the gate, named Good-will,

<P>who asked who was there? and whence he came? and what he would have?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{61}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Here is a poor burdened sinner.&nbsp; I come from

<P>the City of Destruction, but am going to Mount Zion,

<P>that I may be delivered from the wrath to come.&nbsp; I would therefore,

<P>Sir, since I am informed that by this gate is the way thither,

<P>know if you are willing to let me in?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The gate will be opened to broken-hearted sinners>

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with that

<P>he opened the gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{62}

<P>So when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a pull.

<P>Then said Christian, What means that?&nbsp; The other told him.

<P>A little distance from this gate, there is erected a strong castle,

<P>of which Beelzebub is the captain; &lt;Satan envies those that enter

<P>the strait gate> from thence, both he and them that are with him

<P>shoot arrows at those that come up to this gate, if haply they may die

<P>before they can enter in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Christian entered the gate with joy and trembling>

<P>Then said Christian, I rejoice and tremble.&nbsp; So when he was got
in,

<P>the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{63}

<P>&lt;Talk between Good-will and Christian>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Evangelist bid me come hither, and knock, (as I did);

<P>and he said that you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; An open door is set before thee, and no man can shut
it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; But how is it that you came alone?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Because none of my neighbours saw their danger, as I saw
mine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Did any of them know of your coming?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes; my wife and children saw me at the first, and called
after me

<P>to turn again; also, some of my neighbours stood crying

<P>and calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears,

<P>and so came on my way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to
go back?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable; but when they saw

<P>that they could not prevail, Obstinate went railing back,

<P>but Pliable came with me a little way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; But why did he not come through?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{64}

<P>&lt;A man may have company when he sets out for heaven,

<P>and yet go thither alone>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; We, indeed, came both together, until we came

<P>at the Slough of Despond, into the which we also suddenly fell.

<P>And then was my neighbour, Pliable, discouraged, and would not

<P>venture further.&nbsp; Wherefore, getting out again on that side

<P>next to his own house, he told me I should possess the brave country

<P>alone for him; so he went his way, and I came mine--

<P>he after Obstinate, and I to this gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Then said Good-will, Alas, poor man! is the celestial
glory

<P>of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth

<P>running the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{65}

<P>&lt;Christian accuses himself before the man at the gate>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Truly, said Christian, I have said the truth of Pliable,

<P>and if I should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear

<P>there is no betterment betwixt him and myself.&nbsp; It is true,

<P>he went back to his own house, but I also turned aside to go

<P>in the way of death, being persuaded thereto by the carnal arguments

<P>of one Mr. Worldly Wiseman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Oh, did he light upon you?&nbsp; What! he would have
had you

<P>a sought for ease at the hands of Mr. Legality.&nbsp; They are, both
of them,

<P>a very cheat.&nbsp; But did you take his counsel?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, as far as I durst; I went to find out Mr. Legality,

<P>until I thought that the mountain that stands by his house

<P>would have fallen upon my head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; That mountain has been the death of many,

<P>and will be the death of many more; it is well you escaped being

<P>by it dashed in pieces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, truly, I do not know what had become of me there,

<P>had not Evangelist happily met me again, as I was musing in the midst

<P>of my dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to me again, for else

<P>I had never come hither.&nbsp; But now I am come, such a one as I am,

<P>more fit, indeed, for death, by that mountain, than thus to stand

<P>talking with my lord; but, oh, what a favour is this to me,

<P>that yet I am admitted entrance here!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{66}

<P>&lt;Christian comforted again>

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; We make no objections against any, notwithstanding
all

<P>that they have done before they came hither.&nbsp; They are in no wise

<P>cast out [John vi.37]; and therefore, good Christian, come a little
way

<P>with me, and I will teach thee about the way thou must go.

<P>&lt;Christian directed yet on his way>&nbsp; Look before thee;

<P>dost thou see this narrow way?&nbsp; THAT is the way thou must go;

<P>it was cast up by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ, and his apostles;

<P>and it is as straight as a rule can make it.&nbsp; This is the way

<P>thou must go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{67}

<P>&lt;Christian afraid of losing his way>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But, said Christian, are there no turnings or windings by
which

<P>a stranger may lose his way?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this,

<P>and they are crooked and wide.&nbsp; But thus thou mayest distinguish

<P>the right from the wrong, the right only being straight and narrow.

<P>[Matt 7:14]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{68}

<P>&lt;Christian weary of his burden>

<P>Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked him further

<P>if he could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back;

<P>for as yet he had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means

<P>get it off without help.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;There is no deliverance from guilt and burden of sin,

<P>but by the death and blood of Christ>

<P>He told him, As to thy burden, be content to bear it, until thou comest

<P>to the place of deliverance; for there it will fall from thy back

<P>of itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{69}

<P>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself

<P>to his journey.&nbsp; So the other told him, That by that he was gone

<P>some distance from the gate, he would come at the house

<P>of the Interpreter, at whose door he should knock, and he would show
him

<P>excellent things.&nbsp; Then Christian took his leave of his friend,

<P>and he again bid him God-speed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{70}

<P>&lt;Christian comes to the house of the interpreter>

<P>Then he went on till he came to the house of the Interpreter,

<P>where he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door,

<P>and asked who was there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{71}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance

<P>of the good-man of this house to call here for my profit;

<P>I would therefore speak with the master of the house.

<P>So he called for the master of the house, who, after a little time,

<P>came to Christian, and asked him what he would have.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;He is entertained>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from

<P>the City of Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion;

<P>and I was told by the man that stands at the gate, at the head

<P>of this way, that if I called here, you would show me excellent things,

<P>such as would be a help to me in my journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{72}

<P>&lt;Illumination>

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter, Come in; I will show that

<P>which will be profitable to thee.&nbsp; So he commanded his man

<P>to light the candle, and bid Christian follow him:&nbsp; so he had him

<P>into a private room, &lt;Christian sees a grave picture> and bid his
man

<P>open a door; the which when he had done, Christian saw the picture

<P>of a very grave person hang up against the wall; and this was

<P>the fashion of it.&nbsp; &lt;The fashion of the picture>&nbsp; It had
eyes

<P>lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of truth

<P>was written upon his lips, the world was behind his back.

<P>It stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang

<P>over his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What meaneth this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{73}

<P>&lt;The meaning of the picture>

<P>INTER.&nbsp; The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand;

<P>he can beget children [1 Cor. 4:15], travail in birth with children

<P>[Gal. 4:19], and nurse them himself when they are born.

<P>And whereas thou seest him with his eyes lift up to heaven,

<P>the best of books in his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips,

<P>it is to show thee that his work is to know and unfold dark things

<P>to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with
men:

<P>and whereas thou seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown

<P>hangs over his head, that is to show thee that slighting and despising

<P>the things that are present, for the love that he hath

<P>to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next

<P>to have glory for his reward.&nbsp; &lt;Why he showed him the picture
first>

<P>Now, said the Interpreter, I have showed thee this picture first,

<P>because the man whose picture this is, is the only man whom

<P>the Lord of the place whither thou art going, hath authorised to be

<P>thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in the way;

<P>wherefore, take good heed to what I have shewed thee, and bear well

<P>in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with

<P>some that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{74}

<P>Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large parlour

<P>that was full of dust, because never swept; the which after he had

<P>reviewed a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to sweep.

<P>Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began so abundantly to fly about,

<P>that Christian had almost therewith been choked.&nbsp; Then said

<P>the Interpreter to a damsel that stood by, Bring hither the water,

<P>and sprinkle the room; the which, when she had done,

<P>it was swept and cleansed with pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{75}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What means this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of
a man

<P>that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel;

<P>the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions, that have defiled

<P>the whole man.&nbsp; He that began to sweep at first, is the Law;

<P>but she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the Gospel.

<P>Now, whereas thou sawest, that so soon as the first began to sweep,

<P>the dust did so fly about that the room by him could not be cleansed,

<P>but that thou wast almost choked therewith; this is to shew thee,

<P>that the law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin,

<P>doth revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul,

<P>even as it doth discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power

<P>to subdue.&nbsp; [Rom. 7:6; 1 Cor. 15:56; Rom. 5:20]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{76}

<P>Again, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle the room with water,

<P>upon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to show thee,

<P>that when the gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof

<P>to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust

<P>by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued,

<P>and the soul made clean through the faith of it, and consequently fit

<P>{77}

<P>I saw, moreover, in my dream, that the Interpreter took him by the hand,

<P>and had him into a little room, where sat two little children,

<P>each one in his chair.&nbsp; &lt;He showed him passion and patience>

<P>The name of the eldest was Passion, and the name of the other Patience.

<P>Passion seemed to be much discontented; but Patience was very quiet.

<P>Then Christian asked, What is the reason of the discontent of Passion?

<P>&lt;Passion will have all now.&nbsp; Patience is for waiting>

<P>The Interpreter answered, The Governor of them would have him stay

<P>for his best things till the beginning of the next year;

<P>but he will have all now:&nbsp; but Patience is willing to wait.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Passion has his desire>

<P>Then I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of treasure,

<P>and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up

<P>and rejoiced therein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn.

<P>&lt;And quickly lavishes all away>&nbsp; But I beheld but a while,

<P>and he had lavished all away, and had nothing left him but rags.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{78}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to the Interpreter, Expound this matter

<P>more fully to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The matter expounded>

<P>INTER.&nbsp; So he said, These two lads are figures:&nbsp; Passion,
of the men

<P>of this world; and Patience, of the men of that which is to come;

<P>for as here thou seest, Passion will have all now this year,

<P>that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this world,

<P>they must have all their good things now, they cannot stay

<P>till next year, that is until the next world, for their portion of good.

<P>&lt;The worldly man for a bird in the hand>&nbsp; That proverb,

<P>`A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush', is of more authority

<P>with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the good of the world

<P>to come.&nbsp; But as thou sawest that he had quickly lavished all away,

<P>and had presently left him nothing but rags; so will it be with all

<P>such men at the end of this world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Patience has the best wisdom>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Now I see that Patience has the best
wisdom,

<P>and that upon many accounts.&nbsp; First, because he stays

<P>for the best things.&nbsp; Second, and also because he will have

<P>the glory of his, when the other has nothing but rags.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{79}

<P>&lt;Things that are first must give place; but things that are last

<P>are lasting>

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next
world

<P>will never wear out; but these are suddenly gone.&nbsp; Therefore Passion

<P>had not so much reason to laugh at Patience, because he had

<P>his good things first, as Patience will have to laugh at Passion,

<P>because he had his best things last; for first must give place to last,

<P>because last must have his time to come; but last gives place

<P>to nothing; for there is not another to succeed.&nbsp; He, therefore,

<P>that hath his portion first, must needs have a time to spend it;

<P>but he that hath his portion last, must have it lastingly;

<P>&lt;Dives had his good things first> therefore it is said of Dives,

<P>"Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise

<P>Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."

<P>[Luke 16:25]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then I perceive it is not best to covet things that are now,

<P>but to wait for things to come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The first things are but temporal>

<P>INTER.&nbsp; You say the truth:&nbsp; "For the things which are seen
are temporal;

<P>but the things which are not seen are eternal."&nbsp; [2 Cor. 4:18]

<P>But though this be so, yet since things present and our fleshly appetite

<P>are such near neighbours one to another; and again,

<P>because things to come, and carnal sense, are such strangers

<P>one to another; therefore it is, that the first of these so suddenly

<P>fall into amity, and that distance is so continued between the second.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{80}

<P>Then I saw in my dream that the Interpreter took Christian by the hand,

<P>and led him into a place where was a fire burning against a wall,

<P>and one standing by it, always casting much water upon it, to quench
it;

<P>yet did the fire burn higher and hotter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Christian, What means this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{81}

<P>The Interpreter answered, This fire is the work of grace that is

<P>wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish

<P>and put it out, is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire

<P>notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt also see

<P>the reason of that.&nbsp; So he had him about to the backside of the
wall,

<P>where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the which

<P>he did also continually cast, but secretly, into the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Christian, What means this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{82}

<P>The Interpreter answered, This is Christ, who continually,

<P>with the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun

<P>in the heart:&nbsp; by the means of which, notwithstanding what the
devil

<P>can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still.&nbsp; [2 Cor.
12:9]

<P>And in that thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain

<P>the fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted

<P>to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I saw also, that the Interpreter took him again by the hand,

<P>and led him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately palace,

<P>beautiful to behold; at the sight of which Christian

<P>was greatly delighted.&nbsp; He saw also, upon the top thereof,

<P>certain persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Christian, May we go in thither?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{83}

<P>&lt;The valiant man>

<P>Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the door

<P>of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of men,

<P>as desirous to go in; but durst not.&nbsp; There also sat a man

<P>at a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with a book

<P>and his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should

<P>enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men in armour

<P>to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter

<P>what hurt and mischief they could.&nbsp; Now was Christian somewhat
in amaze.

<P>At last, when every man started back for fear of the armed men,

<P>Christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the man

<P>that sat there to write, saying, Set down my name, Sir:&nbsp; the which

<P>when he had done, he saw the man draw his sword, and put a helmet

<P>upon his head, and rush toward the door upon the armed men, who laid

<P>upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged,

<P>fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely.&nbsp; So after he had received

<P>and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out,

<P>he cut his way through them all [Acts 14:.22], and pressed forward

<P>into the palace, at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those

<P>that were within, even of those that walked upon the top of the palace,

<P>saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, come in;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eternal glory thou shalt win."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they.

<P>Then Christian smiled and said; I think verily I know the meaning

<P>of this.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{84}

<P>&lt;Despair like an iron cage>

<P>Now, said Christian, let me go hence.&nbsp; Nay, stay, said the Interpreter,

<P>till I have shewed thee a little more, and after that thou shalt go

<P>on thy way.&nbsp; So he took him by the hand again, and led him into

<P>a very dark room, where there sat a man in an iron cage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes

<P>looking down to the ground, his hands folded together,

<P>and he sighed as if he would break his heart.&nbsp; Then said Christian,

<P>What means this?&nbsp; At which the Interpreter bid him talk with the
man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said Christian to the man, What art thou?&nbsp; The man answered,

<P>I am what I was not once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{85}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; What wast thou once?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; The man said, I was once a fair and flourishing professor,

<P>both in mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once was,

<P>as I thought, fair for the Celestial City, and had then even joy

<P>at the thoughts that I should get thither.&nbsp; [Luke 8:13]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, but what art thou now?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; I am now a man of despair, and am shut up in it,

<P>as in this iron cage.&nbsp; I cannot get out.&nbsp; Oh, now I cannot!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But how camest thou in this condition?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; I left off to watch and be sober.&nbsp; I laid the reins,

<P>upon the neck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word

<P>and the goodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone;

<P>I tempted the devil, and he is come to me; I have provoked God to anger,

<P>and he has left me:&nbsp; I have so hardened my heart, that I cannot
repent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{86}

<P>Then said Christian to the Interpreter, But is there no hope for such

<P>a man as this?&nbsp; Ask him, said the Interpreter.&nbsp; Nay, said
Christian,

<P>pray, Sir, do you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter, Is there no hope, but you must
be

<P>kept in the iron cage of despair?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; No, none at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Why, the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; I have crucified him to myself afresh [Heb. 6:6];

<P>I have despised his person [Luke 19:14]; I have despised

<P>his righteousness; I have "counted his blood an unholy thing";

<P>I have "done despite to the Spirit of grace".&nbsp; [Heb. 10:28-29]

<P>Therefore I have shut myself out of all the promises,

<P>and there now remains to me nothing but threatenings,

<P>dreadful threatenings, fearful threatenings, of certain judgement

<P>and fiery indignation, which shall devour me as an adversary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{87}

<P>INTER.&nbsp; For what did you bring yourself into this condition?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; For the lusts, pleasures, and profits of this world;

<P>in the enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight;

<P>but now every one of those things also bite me, and gnaw me

<P>like a burning worm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; But canst thou not now repent and turn?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{88}

<P>MAN.&nbsp; God hath denied me repentance.&nbsp; His Word gives me no
encouragement

<P>to believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this iron cage;

<P>nor can all the men in the world let me out.&nbsp; O eternity, eternity!

<P>how shall I grapple with the misery that I must meet with in eternity!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Let this man's
misery

<P>be remembered by thee, and be an everlasting caution to thee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, said Christian, this is fearful!&nbsp; God help me
to watch and

<P>be sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this man's misery!

<P>Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Tarry till I shall show thee one thing more, and then thou
shalt

<P>go on thy way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{89}

<P>So he took Christian by the hand again, and led him into a chamber,

<P>where there was one rising out of bed; and as he put on his raiment,

<P>he shook and trembled.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Why doth this man

<P>thus tremble?&nbsp; The Interpreter then bid him tell to Christian

<P>the reason of his so doing.&nbsp; So he began and said, This night,

<P>as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold the heavens grew

<P>exceeding black; also it thundered and lightened in most fearful wise,

<P>that it put me into an agony; so I looked up in my dream,

<P>and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate, upon which I heard

<P>a great sound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a cloud,

<P>attended with the thousands of heaven; they were all in flaming fire:

<P>also the heavens were in a burning flame.&nbsp; I heard then a voice
saying,

<P>"Arise, ye dead, and come to judgement"; and with that the rocks rent,

<P>the graves opened, and the dead that were therein came forth.

<P>Some of them were exceeding glad, and looked upward; and some sought

<P>to hide themselves under the mountains.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes.
4:16;

<P>Jude 14; John 5:28,29; 2 Thes. 1:7,8; Rev. 20:11-14; Isa. 26:21;

<P>Micah 7:16,17; Ps. 95:1-3;&nbsp; Dan. 7:10]&nbsp; Then I saw the man

<P>that sat upon the cloud open the book, and bid the world draw near.

<P>Yet there was, by reason of a fierce flame which issued out

<P>and came from before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and them,

<P>as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar.&nbsp; [Mal. 3:2,3;

<P>Dan. 7:9,10]&nbsp; I heard it also proclaimed to them that attended
on

<P>the man that sat on the cloud, Gather together the tares, the chaff,

<P>and stubble, and cast them into the burning lake.&nbsp; [Matt. 3:12;
13:30;

<P>Mal. 4:1]&nbsp; And with that, the bottomless pit opened, just whereabout

<P>I stood; out of the mouth of which there came, in an abundant manner,

<P>smoke and coals of fire, with hideous noises.&nbsp; It was also said

<P>to the same persons, "Gather my wheat into the garner."&nbsp; [Luke
3:17]

<P>And with that I saw many catched up and carried away into the clouds,

<P>but I was left behind.&nbsp; [1 Thes. 4:16,17]&nbsp; I also sought to
hide myself,

<P>but I could not, for the man that sat upon the cloud still kept his
eye

<P>upon me; my sins also came into my mind; and my conscience did accuse
me

<P>on every side.&nbsp; [Rom. 3:14,15]&nbsp; Upon this I awaked from my
sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{90}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what is it that made you so afraid of this sight?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MAN.&nbsp; Why, I thought that the day of judgement was come,

<P>and that I was not ready for it:&nbsp; but this frighted me most,

<P>that the angels gathered up several, and left me behind;

<P>also the pit of hell opened her mouth just where I stood.

<P>My conscience, too, afflicted me; and, as I thought, the Judge

<P>had always his eye upon me, shewing indignation in his countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{91}

<P>Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Hast thou considered

<P>all these things?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>INTER.&nbsp; Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as
a goad

<P>in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must go.

<P>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself

<P>to his journey.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter, The Comforter be always

<P>with thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way that leads

<P>to the City.&nbsp; So Christian went on his way, saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here I have seen things rare and profitable;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things pleasant, dreadful, things to make me
stable

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what I have begun to take in hand;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let me think on them, and understand

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore they showed me were, and let me be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{92}

<P>Now I saw in my dream, that the highway up which Christian was to go,

<P>was fenced on either side with a wall, and that wall

<P>was called Salvation.&nbsp; [Isa. 26:1]&nbsp; Up this way, therefore,

<P>did burdened Christian run, but not without great difficulty,

<P>because of the load on his back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{93}

<P>He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending,

<P>and upon that place stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom,

<P>a sepulchre.&nbsp; So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came
up

<P>with the cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders,

<P>and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to
do,

<P>till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in,

<P>and I saw it no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{94}

<P>&lt;When God Releases us of our guilt and burden we are as those

<P>that leap for joy>

<P>Then was Christian glad and lightsome, and said, with a merry heart,

<P>"He hath given me rest by his sorrow, and life by his death."

<P>Then he stood still awhile to look and wonder; for it was

<P>very surprising to him, that the sight of the cross should thus

<P>ease him of his burden.&nbsp; He looked therefore, and looked again,

<P>even till the springs that were in his head sent the waters down

<P>his cheeks.&nbsp; [Zech. 12:10]&nbsp; Now, as he stood looking and weeping,

<P>behold three Shining Ones came to him and saluted him with

<P>"Peace be unto thee".&nbsp; So the first said to him, "Thy sins be

<P>forgiven thee" [Mark 2:5]; the second stripped him of his rags,

<P>and clothed him with change of raiment [Zech. 3:4]; the third also

<P>set a mark on his forehead, and gave him a roll with a seal upon it,

<P>which he bade him look on as he ran, and that he should give it in

<P>at the Celestial Gate.&nbsp; [Eph. 1:13]&nbsp; So they went their way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's this? the Pilgrim.&nbsp; How! 'tis very
true,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old things are past away, all's become new.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange! he's another man, upon my word,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They be fine feathers that make a fine bird.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;A Christian can sing though alone, when God doth give him

<P>the joy of his heart>

<P>Then Christian gave three leaps for joy, and went on singing--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thus far I did come laden with my sin;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor could aught ease the grief that I was in

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I came hither:&nbsp; What a place is this!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here be the beginning of my bliss?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here the burden fall from off my back?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here the strings that bound it to me crack?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest cross! blest sepulchre! blest rather
be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Man that there was put to shame for me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{95}

<P>&lt;Simple, Sloth, and Presumption>

<P>I saw then in my dream, that he went on thus, even until

<P>he came at a bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way,

<P>three men fast asleep, with fetters upon their heels.&nbsp; The name
of

<P>the one was Simple, another Sloth, and the third Presumption.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{96}

<P>Christian then seeing them lie in this case went to them,

<P>if peradventure he might awake them, and cried, You are like them

<P>that sleep on the top of a mast, for the Dead Sea is under you--

<P>a gulf that hath no bottom.&nbsp; [Prov. 23:34]&nbsp; Awake, therefore,

<P>and come away; be willing also, and I will help you off with your irons.

<P>He also told them, If he that "goeth about like a roaring lion"

<P>comes by, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth.&nbsp; [1 Pet.
5:8]

<P>&lt;There is no persuasion will do, if God openeth not the eyes>

<P>With that they looked upon him, and began to reply in this sort:

<P>Simple said, "I see no danger"; Sloth said, "Yet a little more sleep";

<P>and Presumption said, "Every fat must stand upon its own bottom;

<P>what is the answer else that I should give thee?"&nbsp; And so they
lay down

<P>to sleep again, and Christian went on his way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{97}

<P>Yet was he troubled to think that men in that danger should so

<P>little esteem the kindness of him that so freely offered to help them,

<P>both by awakening of them, counselling of them, and proffering

<P>to help them off with their irons.&nbsp; And as he was troubled thereabout,

<P>he espied two men come tumbling over the wall on the left hand

<P>of the narrow way; and they made up apace to him.&nbsp; The name of
the one

<P>was Formalist, and the name of the other Hypocrisy.&nbsp; So, as I said,

<P>they drew up unto him, who thus entered with them into discourse.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>the beginning of the way?&nbsp; Know you not that it is written,

<P>that he that cometh not in by the door, "but climbeth up some other
way,

<P>the same is a thief and a robber?"&nbsp; [John 10:1]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; They said, That to go to the gate for entrance
was,

<P>by all their countrymen, counted too far about; and that, therefore,

<P>their usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to climb over

<P>the wall, as they had done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But will it not be counted a trespass against the Lord of
the city

<P>whither we are bound, thus to violate his revealed will?

<P>&lt;They that come into the way, but not by the door,

<P>think that they can say something in vindication of their own practice>

<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; They told him, that, as for that, he needed not

<P>to trouble his head thereabout; for what they did they had custom for;

<P>and could produce, if need were, testimony that would witness it

<P>for more than a thousand years.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But, said Christian, will your practice stand a trial at
law?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; They told him, That custom, it being of

<P>so long a standing as above a thousand years, would, doubtless,

<P>now be admitted as a thing legal by any impartial judge; and besides,

<P>said they, if we get into the way, what's matter which way we get in?

<P>if we are in, we are in; thou art but in the way, who, as we perceive,

<P>came in at the gate; and we are also in the way, that came tumbling

<P>over the wall; wherein, now, is thy condition better than ours?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I walk by the rule of my Master; you walk by the rude working

<P>of your fancies.&nbsp; You are counted thieves already, by the Lord

<P>of the way; therefore, I doubt you will not be found true men at

<P>the end of the way.&nbsp; You come in by yourselves, without his direction;

<P>and shall go out by yourselves, without his mercy.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To this they made him but little answer; only they bid him

<P>look to himself.&nbsp; Then I saw that they went on every man in his
way

<P>without much conference one with another, save that these two men

<P>told Christian, that as to laws and ordinances, they doubted not

<P>but they should as conscientiously do them as he; therefore, said they,

<P>we see not wherein thou differest from us but by the coat that is on

<P>thy back, which was, as we trow, given thee by some of thy neighbours,

<P>to hide the shame of thy nakedness.
