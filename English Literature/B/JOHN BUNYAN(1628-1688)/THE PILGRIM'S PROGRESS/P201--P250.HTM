<P>&lt;One good sign of grace>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; A work of grace in the soul discovereth itself,

<P>either to him that hath it, or to standers by.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To him that hath it thus:&nbsp; It gives him conviction of sin,

<P>especially of the defilement of his nature and the sin of unbelief,

<P>(for the sake of which he is sure to be damned, if he findeth not mercy

<P>at God's hand, by faith in Jesus Christ [John 16:8, Rom. 7:24,

<P>John 16:9, Mark 16:16]).&nbsp; This sight and sense of things worketh
in him

<P>sorrow and shame for sin; he findeth, moreover, revealed in him

<P>the Saviour of the world, and the absolute necessity of closing with
him

<P>for life, at the which he findeth hungerings and thirstings after him;

<P>to which hungerings, &amp;c., the promise is made.&nbsp; [Ps. 38:18,
Jer. 31:19,

<P>Gal. 2:16, Acts 4:12, Matt. 5:6, Rev. 21:6]&nbsp; Now, according to

<P>the strength or weakness of his faith in his Saviour,

<P>so is his joy and peace, so is his love to holiness, so are his desires

<P>to know him more, and also to serve him in this world.

<P>But though I say it discovereth itself thus unto him,

<P>yet it is but seldom that he is able to conclude that this

<P>is a work of grace; because his corruptions now, and his abused reason,

<P>make his mind to misjudge in this matter; therefore,

<P>in him that hath this work, there is required a very sound judgement

<P>before he can, with steadiness, conclude that this is a work of grace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{202}

<P>To others, it is thus discovered:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1.&nbsp; By an experimental confession of his faith in Christ.

<P>[Rom. 10:10, Phil. 1:27, Matt. 5:19]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; By a life answerable to that confession; to wit, a life of
holiness,

<P>heart-holiness, family-holiness, (if he hath a family),

<P>and by conversation-holiness in the world which, in the general,

<P>teacheth him, inwardly, to abhor his sin, and himself for that,

<P>in secret; to suppress it in his family and to promote holiness

<P>in the world; not by talk only, as a hypocrite or talkative person

<P>may do, but by a practical subjection, in faith and love,

<P>to the power of the Word.&nbsp; [John 14:15, Ps. 50:23, Job 42:5-6,

<P>Eze. 20:43]&nbsp; And now, Sir, as to this brief description

<P>of the work of grace, and also the discovery of it,

<P>if you have aught to object, object; if not, then give me leave

<P>to propound to you a second question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{203}

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Nay, my part is not now to object, but to hear;

<P>let me, therefore, have your second question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Another good sign of grace>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; It is this:&nbsp; Do you experience this first part

<P>of this description of it? and doth your life and conversation

<P>testify the same? or standeth your religion in word or in tongue,

<P>and not in deed and truth?&nbsp; Pray, if you incline to answer me in
this,

<P>say no more than you know the God above will say Amen to;

<P>and also nothing but what your conscience can justify you in;

<P>for not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom

<P>the Lord commendeth.&nbsp; Besides, to say I am thus and thus,

<P>when my conversation, and all my neighbours, tell me I lie,

<P>is great wickedness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Talkative not pleased with Faithful's question>

<P>{204}

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Then Talkative at first began to blush; but, recovering
himself,

<P>thus he replied:&nbsp; You come now to experience, to conscience, and
God;

<P>and to appeal to him for justification of what is spoken.

<P>This kind of discourse I did not expect; nor am I disposed

<P>to give an answer to such questions, because I count not myself

<P>bound thereto, unless you take upon you to be a catechiser, and,

<P>though you should so do, yet I may refuse to make you my judge.

<P>But, I pray, will you tell me why you ask me such questions?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{205}

<P>&lt;The reasons why Faithful put to him that question>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Because I saw you forward to talk, and because I knew not

<P>that you had aught else but notion.&nbsp; Besides, to tell you all the
truth,

<P>I have heard of you, that you are a man whose religion lies in talk,

<P>and that your conversation gives this your mouth-profession the lie.

<P>&lt;Faithful's plain dealing with Talkative>&nbsp; They say, you are
a spot

<P>among Christians; and that religion fareth the worse

<P>for your ungodly conversation; that some have already stumbled at your

<P>wicked ways, and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby;

<P>your religion, and an ale-house, and covetousness, and uncleanness,

<P>and swearing, and lying, and vain-company keeping, &amp;c.,

<P>will stand together.&nbsp; The proverb is true of you which is said

<P>of a whore, to wit, that she is a shame to all women;

<P>so are you a shame to all professors.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Talkative flings away from Faithful>

<P>TALK.&nbsp; Since you are ready to take up reports and to judge

<P>so rashly as you do, I cannot but conclude you are some

<P>peevish or melancholy man, not fit to be discoursed with; and so adieu.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{206}

<P>&lt;A good riddance>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then came up Christian, and said to his brother,

<P>I told you how it would happen:&nbsp; your words and his lusts

<P>could not agree; he had rather leave your company than reform his life.

<P>But he is gone, as I said; let him go, the loss is no man's but his
own;

<P>he has saved us the trouble of going from him; for he continuing

<P>(as I suppose he will do) as he is, he would have been but a blot in

<P>our company:&nbsp; besides, the apostle says, "From such withdraw thyself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; But I am glad we had this little discourse with him;

<P>it may happen that he will think of it again:&nbsp; however,

<P>I have dealt plainly with him, and so am clear of his blood,

<P>if he perisheth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{207}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; You did well to talk so plainly to him as you did;

<P>there is but little of this faithful dealing with men now-a-days,

<P>and that makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many, as it doth;

<P>for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in word,

<P>and are debauched and vain in their conversation, that

<P>(being so much admitted into the fellowship of the godly)

<P>do puzzle the world, blemish Christianity, and grieve the sincere.

<P>I wish that all men would deal with such as you have done:

<P>then should they either be made more conformable to religion,

<P>or the company of saints would be too hot for them.&nbsp; Then did

<P>Faithful say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How Talkative at first lifts up his plumes!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How bravely doth he speak!&nbsp; How he presumes

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To drive down all before him!&nbsp; But so
soon

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Faithful talks of heart-work, like the moon

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's past the full, into the wane he goes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so will all, but he that HEART-WORK knows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{208}

<P>Thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way,

<P>and so made that way easy which would otherwise, no doubt,

<P>have been tedious to them; for now they went through a wilderness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{209}

<P>&lt;Evangelist overtakes them again>

<P>Now, when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness,

<P>Faithful chanced to cast his eye back, and espied one coming after them,

<P>and he knew him.&nbsp; Oh! said Faithful to his brother, who comes yonder?

<P>Then Christian looked, and said, It is my good friend Evangelist.

<P>Ay, and my good friend too, said Faithful, for it was he that set me

<P>in the way to the gate.&nbsp; Now was Evangelist come up to them,

<P>and thus saluted them:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{210}

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Peace be with you, dearly beloved; and peace be to your
helpers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;They are glad at the sight of him>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Welcome, welcome, my good Evangelist, the sight of thy countenance

<P>brings to my remembrance thy ancient kindness and unwearied labouring

<P>for my eternal good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; And a thousand times welcome, said good Faithful.&nbsp;
Thy company,

<P>O sweet Evangelist, how desirable it is to us poor pilgrims!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist, How hath it fared with you, my friends,

<P>since the time of our last parting?&nbsp; What have you met with,

<P>and how have you behaved yourselves?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{211}

<P>Then Christian and Faithful told him of all things that had happened

<P>to them in the way; and how, and with what difficulty,

<P>they had arrived at that place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{212}

<P>&lt;His exhortation to them>

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Right glad am I, said Evangelist, not that you have met

<P>with trials, but that you have been victors; and for that you have,

<P>notwithstanding many weaknesses, continued in the way to this very day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I say, right glad am I of this thing, and that for mine own sake

<P>and yours.&nbsp; I have sowed, and you have reaped:&nbsp; and the day
is coming,

<P>when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice together;

<P>that is, if you hold out:&nbsp; "for in due season ye shall reap,

<P>if ye faint not."&nbsp; [John 4:36, Gal. 6:9]&nbsp; The crown is before
you,

<P>and it is an incorruptible one; so run, that you may obtain it.

<P>[1 Cor. 9:24-27]&nbsp; Some there be that set out for this crown,

<P>and, after they have gone far for it, another comes in,

<P>and takes it from them:&nbsp; hold fast, therefore, that you have;

<P>let no man take your crown.&nbsp; [Rev. 3:11]&nbsp; You are not yet
out

<P>of the gun-shot of the devil; you have not resisted unto blood,

<P>striving against sin; let the kingdom be always before you,

<P>and believe steadfastly concerning things that are invisible.

<P>Let nothing that is on this side the other world get within you;

<P>and, above all, look well to your own hearts, and to the lusts thereof,

<P>"for they are deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked";

<P>set your faces like a flint; you have all power in heaven and earth

<P>on your side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{213}

<P>&lt;They do thank him for his exhortation>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then Christian thanked him for his exhortation; but told
him,

<P>withal, that they would have him speak further to them for their help

<P>the rest of the way, and the rather, for that they well knew

<P>that he was a prophet, and could tell them of things that might

<P>happen unto them, and also how they might resist and overcome them.

<P>To which request Faithful also consented.&nbsp; So Evangelist began

<P>as followeth:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;He predicteth what troubles they shall meet with in Vanity Fair,

<P>and encourageth them to steadfastness>

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; My sons, you have heard, in the words of the truth of the
gospel,

<P>that you must, through many tribulations, enter into

<P>the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; And, again, that in every city

<P>bonds and afflictions abide in you; and therefore you cannot expect

<P>that you should go long on your pilgrimage without them,

<P>in some sort or other.&nbsp; You have found something of the truth

<P>of these testimonies upon you already, and more will immediately follow;

<P>for now, as you see, you are almost out of this wilderness,

<P>and therefore you will soon come into a town that you will by and by

<P>see before you; and in that town you will be hardly beset with enemies,

<P>who will strain hard but they will kill you; and be you sure

<P>that one or both of you must seal the testimony which you hold,

<P>with blood; but be you faithful unto death, and the King will give you

<P>a crown of life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{214}

<P>&lt;He whose lot it will be there to suffer,

<P>will have the better of his brother>

<P>He that shall die there, although his death will be unnatural,

<P>and his pain perhaps great, he will yet have the better of his fellow;

<P>not only because he will be arrived at the Celestial City soonest,

<P>but because he will escape many miseries that the other will meet with

<P>in the rest of his journey.&nbsp; But when you are come to the town,

<P>and shall find fulfilled what I have here related,

<P>then remember your friend, and quit yourselves like men,

<P>and commit the keeping of your souls to your God in well-doing,

<P>as unto a faithful Creator.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{215}

<P>Then I saw in my dream, that when they were got out of the wilderness,

<P>they presently saw a town before them, and the name of that town

<P>is Vanity; and at the town there is a fair kept, called Vanity Fair:

<P>it is kept all the year long.&nbsp; It beareth the name of Vanity Fair

<P>because the town where it is kept is lighter than vanity;

<P>and, also because all that is there sold, or that cometh thither,

<P>is vanity.&nbsp; As is the saying of the wise, "all that cometh is vanity."

<P>[Eccl. 1; 2:11,17; 11:8; Isa. 11:17]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{216}

<P>This fair is no new-erected business, but a thing of ancient standing;

<P>I will show you the original of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The antiquity of this fair>

<P>Almost five thousand years agone, there were pilgrims walking

<P>to the Celestial City, as these two honest persons are:

<P>and Beelzebub, Apollyon, and Legion, with their companions,

<P>perceiving by the path that the pilgrims made, that their way

<P>to the city lay through this town of Vanity, they contrived here

<P>to set up a fair; a fair wherein, should be sold all sorts of vanity,

<P>and that it should last all the year long:&nbsp; therefore at this fair

<P>are all such merchandise sold, as houses, lands, trades, places,

<P>honours, preferments, titles, countries, kingdoms, lusts, pleasures,

<P>and delights of all sorts, as whores, bawds, wives, husbands, children,

<P>masters, servants, lives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, gold, pearls,

<P>precious stones, and what not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And, moreover, at this fair there is at all times to be seen

<P>juggling cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, and rogues,

<P>and that of every kind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here are to be seen, too, and that for nothing, thefts, murders,

<P>adulteries, false swearers, and that of a blood-red colour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{217}

<P>&lt;The streets of this fair>

<P>And as in other fairs of less moment, there are the several

<P>rows and streets, under their proper names, where such and such wares

<P>are vended; so here likewise you have the proper places, rows,

<P>streets, (viz. countries and kingdoms), where the wares of this fair

<P>are soonest to be found.&nbsp; Here is the Britain Row, the French Row,

<P>the Italian Row, the Spanish Row, the German Row, where several sorts

<P>of vanities are to be sold.&nbsp; But, as in other fairs, some one commodity

<P>is as the chief of all the fair, so the ware of Rome and her merchandise

<P>is greatly promoted in this fair; only our English nation,

<P>with some others, have taken a dislike thereat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{218}

<P>&lt;Christ went through this fair>

<P>Now, as I said, the way to the Celestial City lies just through

<P>this town where this lusty fair is kept; and he that will go

<P>to the city, and yet not go through this town, must needs go out

<P>of the world.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 5:10]&nbsp; &lt;Christ bought nothing in
this fair>

<P>The Prince of princes himself, when here, went through this town

<P>to his own country, and that upon a fair day too; yea, and as I think,

<P>it was Beelzebub, the chief lord of this fair, that invited him

<P>to buy of his vanities; yea, would have made him lord of the fair,

<P>would he but have done him reverence as he went through the town.

<P>[Matt. 4:8, Luke 4:5-7]&nbsp; Yea, because he was such a person of honour,

<P>Beelzebub had him from street to street, and showed him

<P>all the kingdoms of the world in a little time, that he might,

<P>if possible, allure the Blessed One to cheapen and buy some

<P>of his vanities; but he had no mind to the merchandise,

<P>and therefore left the town, without laying out so much

<P>as one farthing upon these vanities.&nbsp; This fair, therefore,

<P>is an ancient thing, of long standing, and a very great fair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{219}

<P>&lt;The pilgrims enter the fair>

<P>Now these pilgrims, as I said, must needs go through this fair.

<P>&lt;The fair in a hubbub about them>&nbsp; Well, so they did:&nbsp;
but, behold,

<P>even as they entered into the fair, all the people in the fair

<P>were moved, and the town itself as it were in a hubbub about them;

<P>and that for several reasons:&nbsp; for--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{220}

<P>&lt;The first cause of the hubbub>

<P>First, The pilgrims were clothed with such kind of raiment

<P>as was diverse from the raiment of any that traded in that fair.

<P>The people, therefore, of the fair, made a great gazing upon them:

<P>some said they were fools, some they were bedlams,

<P>and some they are outlandish men.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 2:7-8]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{221}

<P>&lt;Second cause of the hubbub>

<P>Secondly, And as they wondered at their apparel, so they did likewise

<P>at their speech; for few could understand what they said;

<P>they naturally spoke the language of Canaan, but they that kept the
fair

<P>were the men of this world; so that, from one end of the fair

<P>to the other, they seemed barbarians each to the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{222}

<P>&lt;Third cause of the hubbub>

<P>Thirdly, But that which did not a little amuse the merchandisers was,

<P>that these pilgrims set very light by all their wares; they cared not

<P>so much as to look upon them; and if they called upon them to buy,

<P>they would put their fingers in their ears, and cry,

<P>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and look upwards,

<P>signifying that their trade and traffic was in heaven.&nbsp; [Ps. 119:37,

<P>Phil. 3:19-20]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{223}

<P>&lt;Fourth cause of the hubbub>

<P>One chanced mockingly, beholding the carriage of the men,

<P>to say unto them, What will ye buy?&nbsp; But they, looking gravely
upon him,

<P>answered, "We buy the truth."&nbsp; [Prov. 23:23]&nbsp; &lt;They are
mocked>

<P>At that there was an occasion taken to despise the men the more;

<P>some mocking, some taunting, some speaking reproachfully,

<P>and some calling upon others to smite them.&nbsp; &lt;The fair in a
hubbub>

<P>At last things came to a hubbub and great stir in the fair,

<P>insomuch that all order was confounded.&nbsp; Now was word presently
brought

<P>to the great one of the fair, who quickly came down,

<P>and deputed some of his most trusty friends to take these men

<P>into examination, about whom the fair was almost overturned.

<P>&lt;They are examined>&nbsp; So the men were brought to examination;

<P>and they that sat upon them, asked them whence they came,

<P>whither they went, and what they did there, in such an unusual garb?

<P>&lt;They tell who they are, and whence they came>&nbsp; The men told
them

<P>that they were pilgrims and strangers in the world, and that they

<P>were going to their own country, which was the heavenly Jerusalem,

<P>[Heb. 11:13-16] and that they had given no occasion to the men

<P>of the town, nor yet to the merchandisers, thus to abuse them,

<P>and to let them in their journey, except it was for that,

<P>when one asked them what they would buy, they said they would buy

<P>the truth.&nbsp; &lt;They are not believed>&nbsp; But they that were
appointed to

<P>examine them did not believe them to be any other than bedlams and mad,

<P>or else such as came to put all things into a confusion in the fair.

<P>&lt;They are put in the cage>&nbsp; Therefore they took them and beat
them,

<P>and besmeared them with dirt, and then put them into the cage,

<P>that they might be made a spectacle to all the men of the fair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold Vanity Fair! the Pilgrims there

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are chain'd and stand beside:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so it was our Lord pass'd here,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Mount Calvary died.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{224}

<P>&lt;Their behaviour in the cage>

<P>There, therefore, they lay for some time, and were made the objects

<P>of any man's sport, or malice, or revenge, the great one of the fair

<P>laughing still at all that befell them.&nbsp; But the men being patient,

<P>and not rendering railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing,

<P>and good words for bad, and kindness for injuries done,

<P>some men in the fair that were more observing, and less prejudiced

<P>than the rest, began to check and blame the baser sort

<P>for their continual abuses done by them to the men; they, therefore,

<P>in angry manner, let fly at them again, counting them as bad

<P>as the men in the cage, and telling them that they seemed confederates,

<P>and should be made partakers of their misfortunes.

<P>&lt;The men of the fair do fall out among themselves about these two
men>

<P>The other replied that, for aught they could see, the men were quiet,

<P>and sober, and intended nobody any harm; and that there were many

<P>that traded in their fair that were more worthy to be put into the cage,

<P>yea, and pillory too, than were the men they had abused.&nbsp; Thus,

<P>after divers words had passed on both sides, the men behaving themselves

<P>all the while very wisely and soberly before them,

<P>they fell to some blows among themselves, and did harm one to another.

<P>&lt;They are made the authors of this disturbance>&nbsp; Then were these

<P>two poor men brought before their examiners again, and there charged

<P>as being guilty of the late hubbub that had been in the fair.

<P>&lt;They are led up and down the fair in chains, for a terror to others>

<P>So they beat them pitifully, and hanged irons upon them,

<P>and led them in chains up and down the fair, for an example and a terror

<P>to others, lest any should speak in their behalf, or join themselves

<P>unto them.&nbsp; &lt;Some of the men of the fair won to them>

<P>But Christian and Faithful behaved themselves yet more wisely,

<P>and received the ignominy and shame that was cast upon them,

<P>with so much meekness and patience, that it won to their side,

<P>though but few in comparison of the rest, several of the men

<P>in the fair.&nbsp; This put the other party yet into greater rage,

<P>insomuch that they concluded the death of these two men.

<P>&lt;Their adversaries resolve to kill them>&nbsp; Wherefore they threatened,

<P>that the cage nor irons should serve their turn, but that they

<P>should die, for the abuse they had done, and for deluding the men

<P>of the fair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then were they remanded to the cage again, until further order should

<P>be taken with them.&nbsp; So they put them in, and made their feet fast

<P>in the stocks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{225}

<P>Here, therefore, they called again to mind what they had heard

<P>from their faithful friend Evangelist, and were the more confirmed

<P>in their way and sufferings by what he told them would happen to them.

<P>They also now comforted each other, that whose lot it was to suffer,

<P>even he should have the best of it; therefore each man secretly wished

<P>that he might have that preferment:&nbsp; but committing themselves
to

<P>the all-wise disposal of Him that ruleth all things, with much content,

<P>they abode in the condition in which they were, until they should be

<P>otherwise disposed of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{226}

<P>&lt;They are again put into the cage, and after brought to trial>

<P>Then a convenient time being appointed, they brought them forth

<P>to their trial, in order to their condemnation.&nbsp; When the time
was come,

<P>they were brought before their enemies and arraigned.&nbsp; The judge's
name

<P>was Lord Hate-good.&nbsp; Their indictment was one and the same in substance,

<P>though somewhat varying in form, the contents whereof were this:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{227}

<P>&lt;Their indictment>

<P>"That they were enemies to and disturbers of their trade;

<P>that they had made commotions and divisions in the town,

<P>and had won a party to their own most dangerous opinions,

<P>in contempt of the law of their prince."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, FAITHFUL, play the man, speak for thy
God:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear not the wicked's malice; nor their rod:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak boldly, man, the truth is on thy side:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Die for it, and to life in triumph ride.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{228}

<P>&lt;Faithful's answer for himself>

<P>Then Faithful began to answer, that he had only set himself against

<P>that which hath set itself against Him that is higher than the highest.

<P>And, said he, as for disturbance, I make none, being myself

<P>a man of peace; the parties that were won to us, were won by beholding

<P>our truth and innocence, and they are only turned from the worse

<P>to the better. And as to the king you talk of, since he is Beelzebub,

<P>the enemy of our Lord, I defy him and all his angels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{229}

<P>Then proclamation was made, that they that had aught to say

<P>for their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar,

<P>should forthwith appear and give in their evidence. So there came in

<P>three witnesses, to wit, Envy, Superstition, and Pickthank.

<P>They were then asked if they knew the prisoner at the bar;

<P>and what they had to say for their lord the king against him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{230}

<P>&lt;Envy begins>

<P>Then stood forth Envy, and said to this effect:&nbsp; My Lord,

<P>I have known this man a long time, and will attest upon my oath

<P>before this honourable bench, that he is--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Hold!&nbsp; Give him his oath.&nbsp; (So they sware him.)&nbsp;
Then he said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>ENVY.&nbsp; My Lord, this man, notwithstanding his plausible name,

<P>is one of the vilest men in our country.&nbsp; He neither regardeth

<P>prince nor people, law nor custom; but doth all that he can

<P>to possess all men with certain of his disloyal notions,

<P>which he in the general calls principles of faith and holiness.

<P>And, in particular, I heard him once myself affirm that Christianity

<P>and the customs of our town of Vanity were diametrically opposite,

<P>and could not be reconciled.&nbsp; By which saying, my Lord,

<P>he doth at once not only condemn all our laudable doings,

<P>but us in the doing of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Then did the Judge say to him, Hast thou any more to say?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>ENVY.&nbsp; My Lord, I could say much more, only I would not be tedious

<P>to the court.&nbsp; Yet, if need be, when the other gentlemen have given
in

<P>their evidence, rather than anything shall be wanting

<P>that will despatch him, I will enlarge my testimony against him.

<P>So he was bid to stand by.&nbsp; Then they called Superstition,

<P>and bid him look upon the prisoner.&nbsp; They also asked, what he could
say

<P>for their lord the king against him.&nbsp; Then they sware him; so he
began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{231}

<P>&lt;Superstition follows>

<P>SUPER.&nbsp; My Lord, I have no great acquaintance with this man,

<P>nor do I desire to have further knowledge of him; however, this I know,

<P>that he is a very pestilent fellow, from some discourse that,

<P>the other day, I had with him in this town; for then, talking with him,

<P>I heard him say, that our religion was naught, and such by which

<P>a man could by no means please God.&nbsp; Which sayings of his, my Lord,

<P>your Lordship very well knows, what necessarily thence will follow,

<P>to wit, that we do still worship in vain, are yet in our sins,

<P>and finally shall be damned; and this is that which I have to say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{232}

<P>Then was Pickthank sworn, and bid say what he knew,

<P>in behalf of their lord the king, against the prisoner at the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Pickthank's testimony>

<P>Pick. My Lord, and you gentlemen all, This fellow I have known

<P>of a long time, and have heard him speak things that ought not

<P>to be spoke; for he hath railed on our noble prince Beelzebub,

<P>and hath spoken contemptibly of his honourable friends,

<P>&lt;Sins are all lords and great ones> whose names are

<P>the Lord Old Man, the Lord Carnal Delight, the Lord Luxurious,

<P>the Lord Desire of Vain Glory, my old Lord Lechery, Sir Having Greedy,

<P>with all the rest of our nobility; and he hath said, moreover,

<P>That if all men were of his mind, if possible, there is not

<P>one of these noblemen should have any longer a being in this town.

<P>Besides, he hath not been afraid to rail on you, my Lord,

<P>who are now appointed to be his judge, calling you an ungodly villain,

<P>with many other such like vilifying terms, with which

<P>he hath bespattered most of the gentry of our town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{233}

<P>When this Pickthank had told his tale, the Judge directed his speech

<P>to the prisoner at the bar, saying, Thou runagate, heretic, and traitor,

<P>hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; May I speak a few words in my own defence?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Sirrah! sirrah! thou deservest to live no longer,

<P>but to be slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men may see

<P>our gentleness towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate,

<P>hast to say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{234}

<P>&lt;Faithful's defence of himself>

<P>FAITH.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; I say, then, in answer to what Mr. Envy hath spoken,

<P>I never said aught but this, That what rule, or laws, or customs,

<P>or people, were flat against the Word of God, are diametrically opposite

<P>to Christianity.&nbsp; If I have said amiss in this, convince me of
my error,

<P>and I am ready here before you to make my recantation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{235}

<P>2.&nbsp; As to the second, to wit, Mr. Superstition, and his charge

<P>against me, I said only this, That in the worship of God

<P>there is required a Divine faith; but there can be no Divine faith

<P>without a Divine revelation of the will of God.&nbsp; Therefore,

<P>whatever is thrust into the worship of God that is not agreeable

<P>to Divine revelation, cannot be done but by a human faith,

<P>which faith will not be profitable to eternal life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{236}

<P>3. As to what Mr. Pickthank hath said, I say (avoiding terms,

<P>as that I am said to rail, and the like) that the prince of this town,

<P>with all the rabblement, his attendants, by this gentleman named,

<P>are more fit for a being in hell, than in this town and country:

<P>and so, the Lord have mercy upon me!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{237}

<P>&lt;The Judge's speech to the jury>

<P>Then the Judge called to the jury (who all this while stood by,

<P>to hear and observe):&nbsp; Gentlemen of the jury, you see this man

<P>about whom so great an uproar hath been made in this town.

<P>You have also heard what these worthy gentlemen have witnessed

<P>against him.&nbsp; Also you have heard his reply and confession.

<P>It lieth now in your breasts to hang him or save his life;

<P>but yet I think meet to instruct you into our law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{238}

<P>There was an Act made in the days of Pharaoh the Great,

<P>servant to our prince, that lest those of a contrary religion

<P>should multiply and grow too strong for him, their males should be

<P>thrown into the river.&nbsp; [Exo. 1:22]&nbsp; There was also an Act
made

<P>in the days of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, another of his servants,

<P>that whosoever would not fall down and worship his golden image,

<P>should be thrown into a fiery furnace.&nbsp; [Dan. 3:6]&nbsp; There
was also

<P>an Act made in the days of Darius, that whoso, for some time,

<P>called upon any god but him, should be cast into the lions' den.

<P>[Dan. 6]&nbsp; Now the substance of these laws this rebel has broken,

<P>not only in thought, (which is not to be borne), but also

<P>in word and deed; which must therefore needs be intolerable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{239}

<P>For that of Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition,

<P>to prevent mischief, no crime being yet apparent;

<P>but here is a crime apparent.&nbsp; For the second and third,

<P>you see he disputeth against our religion; and for the treason

<P>he hath confessed, he deserveth to die the death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{240}

<P>&lt;The jury and their names>

<P>Then went the jury out, whose names were, Mr. Blind-man, Mr. No-good,

<P>Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind,

<P>Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, and Mr. Implacable;

<P>who every one gave in his private verdict against him among themselves,

<P>and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty

<P>before the Judge.&nbsp; &lt;Everyones private verdict>&nbsp; And first,

<P>among themselves, Mr. Blind-man, the foreman, said,

<P>I see clearly that this man is a heretic.&nbsp; Then said Mr. No-good,

<P>Away with such a fellow from the earth.&nbsp; Ay, said Mr. Malice,

<P>for I hate the very looks of him.&nbsp; Then said Mr. Love-lust,

<P>I could never endure him.&nbsp; Nor I, said Mr. Live-loose,

<P>for he would always be condemning my way.&nbsp; Hang him, hang him,

<P>said Mr. Heady.&nbsp; A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind.

<P>My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity.&nbsp; He is a rogue,

<P>said Mr. Liar.&nbsp; Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty.

<P>Let us despatch him out of the way, said Mr. Hate-light.

<P>Then said Mr. Implacable, Might I have all the world given me,

<P>I could not be reconciled to him; &lt;They conclude to bring him in
guilty

<P>of death> therefore, let us forthwith bring him in guilty of death.

<P>And so they did; therefore he was presently condemned to be had

<P>from the place where he was, to the place from whence he came,

<P>and there to be put to the most cruel death that could be invented.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{241}

<P>&lt;The cruel death of Faithful>

<P>They therefore brought him out, to do with him according to their law;

<P>and, first, they scourged him, then they buffeted him,

<P>then they lanced his flesh with knives; after that, they stoned him

<P>with stones, then pricked him with their swords; and, last of all,

<P>they burned him to ashes at the stake.&nbsp; Thus came Faithful to his
end.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{242}

<P>&lt;A chariot and horses wait to take away Faithful>

<P>Now I saw that there stood behind the multitude a chariot

<P>and a couple of horses, waiting for Faithful, who (so soon as

<P>his adversaries had despatched him) was taken up into it,

<P>and straightway was carried up through the clouds,

<P>with sound of trumpet, the nearest way to the Celestial Gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave FAITHFUL, bravely done in word
and deed;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge, witnesses, and jury have, instead

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of overcoming thee, but shown their rage:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they are dead, thou'lt live from
age to age*.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>*In the New Heaven and New Earth.&nbsp; {footnote from one edition}
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{243}

<P>&lt;Christian is still alive>

<P>But as for Christian, he had some respite, and was remanded

<P>back to prison.&nbsp; So he there remained for a space;

<P>but He that overrules all things, having the power of their rage

<P>in his own hand, so wrought it about, that Christian for that time

<P>escaped them, and went his way.&nbsp; And as he went, he sang, saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The song that Christian made of Faithful after his death>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Faithful, thou hast faithfully profest

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto thy Lord; with whom thou shalt be blest,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When faithless ones, with all their vain delights,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are crying out under their hellish plights:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sing, Faithful, sing, and let thy name survive;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For though they kill'd thee, thou art yet alive!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{244}

<P>&lt;Christian has another companion>

<P>Now I saw in my dream, that Christian went not forth alone,

<P>for there was one whose name was Hopeful (being made so

<P>by the beholding of Christian and Faithful in their words and behaviour,

<P>in their sufferings at the fair), who joined himself unto him, and,

<P>entering into a brotherly covenant, told him that he would be

<P>his companion.&nbsp; Thus, one died to bear testimony to the truth,

<P>and another rises out of his ashes, to be a companion with Christian

<P>in his pilgrimage.&nbsp; &lt;There are more of the men of the fair will
follow>

<P>This Hopeful also told Christian, that there were many more

<P>of the men in the fair, that would take their time and follow after.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{245}

<P>&lt;They overtake By-ends>

<P>So I saw that quickly after they were got out of the fair,

<P>they overtook one that was going before them, whose name was By-ends:

<P>so they said to him, What countryman, Sir? and how far go you this way?

<P>He told them that he came from the town of Fair-speech,

<P>and he was going to the Celestial City (but told them not his name).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From Fair-speech! said Christian.&nbsp; Is there any good that lives
there?

<P>[Prov. 26:25]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Yes, said By-ends, I hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, Sir, what may I call you? said Christian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;By-ends loath to tell his name>

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; I am a stranger to you, and you to me:&nbsp; if you be
going

<P>this way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must be content.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; This town of Fair-speech, said Christian, I have heard of;

<P>and, as I remember, they say it is a wealthy place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I have very many

<P>rich kindred there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{246}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, who are your kindred there? if a man may be so bold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Almost the whole town; and in particular, my Lord Turn-about,

<P>my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair-speech, (from whose ancestors

<P>that town first took its name), also Mr. Smooth-man,

<P>Mr. Facing-both-ways, Mr. Any-thing; and the parson of our parish,

<P>Mr. Two-tongues, was my mother's own brother by father's side;

<P>and to tell you the truth, I am become a gentleman of good quality,

<P>yet my great-grandfather was but a waterman, looking one way

<P>and rowing another, and I got most of my estate by the same occupation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Are you a married man?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The wife and kindred of By-ends>

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous woman,

<P>the daughter of a virtuous woman; she was my Lady Feigning's daughter,

<P>therefore she came of a very honourable family, and is arrived

<P>to such a pitch of breeding, that she knows how to carry it to all,

<P>even to prince and peasant.&nbsp; &lt;Where By-ends differs from others

<P>in religion>&nbsp; It is true we somewhat differ in religion

<P>from those of the stricter sort, yet but in two small points:

<P>first, we never strive against wind and tide; secondly,

<P>we are always most zealous when religion goes in his silver slippers;

<P>we love much to walk with him in the street, if the sun shines,

<P>and the people applaud him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{247}

<P>Then Christian stepped a little aside to his fellow, Hopeful,

<P>saying, It runs in my mind that this is one By-ends of Fair-speech;

<P>and if it be he, we have as very a knave in our company as dwelleth

<P>in all these parts.&nbsp; Then said Hopeful, Ask him; methinks he should
not

<P>be ashamed of his name.&nbsp; So Christian came up with him again, and
said,

<P>Sir, you talk as if you knew something more than all the world doth;

<P>and if I take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a guess of you:

<P>Is not your name Mr. By-ends, of Fair-speech?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; This is not my name, but indeed it is a nick-name

<P>that is given me by some that cannot abide me:&nbsp; and I must be content

<P>to bear it as a reproach, as other good men have borne theirs before
me.

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But did you never give an occasion to men to call you

<P>by this name?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;How By-ends got his name>

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Never, never! The worst that ever I did to give them

<P>an occasion to give me this name was, that I had always the luck

<P>to jump in my judgment with the present way of the times,

<P>whatever it was, and my chance was to get thereby; but if things

<P>are thus cast upon me, let me count them, a blessing;

<P>but let not the malicious load me therefore with reproach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{248}

<P>more properly than you are willing we should think it doth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;He desires to keep company with Christian>

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot help it;

<P>you shall find me a fair company-keeper, if you will still admit me

<P>your associate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; If you will go with us, you must go against wind and tide;

<P>the which, I perceive, is against your opinion; you must also own

<P>religion in his rags, as well as when in his silver slippers;

<P>and stand by him, too, when bound in irons, as well as when

<P>he walketh the streets with applause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; You must not impose, nor lord it over my faith;

<P>leave me to my liberty, and let me go with you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Not a step further, unless you will do in what I propound
as we.

<P>&lt;By-ends and Christian part>

<P>Now I saw in my dream that Christian and Hopeful forsook him,

<P>and kept their distance before him; but one of them looking back,

<P>saw three men following Mr. By-ends, and behold, as they

<P>came up with him, he made them a very low conge {conge'};

<P>and they also gave him a compliment.&nbsp; &lt;He has new companions>

<P>The men's names were Mr. Hold-the-world, Mr. Money-love,

<P>and Mr. Save-all; men that Mr. By-ends had formerly been

<P>acquainted with; for in their minority they were schoolfellows,

<P>and were taught by one Mr. Gripe-man, a schoolmaster in Love-gain,

<P>which is a market town in the county of Coveting, in the north.

<P>This schoolmaster taught them the art of getting, either by violence,

<P>cozenage, flattery, lying, or by putting on the guise of religion;

<P>and these four gentlemen had attained much of the art of their master,

<P>so that they could each of them have kept such a school themselves.

<P>Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other,

<P>Mr. Money-love said to Mr. By-ends, Who are they upon the road

<P>before us? (for Christian and Hopeful were yet within view).

<P>&lt;By-ends' character of the pilgrims>

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; They are a couple of far countrymen, that, after their
mode,

<P>are going on pilgrimage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MONEY-LOVE.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Why did they not stay, that we might have
had

<P>their good company? for they, and we, and you, Sir, I hope,

<P>are all going on pilgrimage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; We are so, indeed; but the men before us are so rigid,

<P>and love so much their own notions, and do also so lightly esteem

<P>the opinions of others, that let a man be never so godly,

<P>yet if he jumps not with them in all things, they thrust him

<P>quite out of their company.
