<P>&lt;Christian has got his Lord's coat on his back, and is

<P>comforted therewith; he is comforted, also, with his mark and his roll>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; By laws and ordinances you will not be saved, since you

<P>came not in by the door.&nbsp; [Gal. 2:16]&nbsp; And as for this coat
that is on

<P>my back, it was given me by the Lord of the place whither I go;

<P>and that, as you say, to cover my nakedness with.&nbsp; And I take it
as

<P>a token of his kindness to me; for I had nothing but rags before.

<P>And besides, thus I comfort myself as I go:&nbsp; Surely, think I,

<P>when I come to the gate of the city, the Lord thereof will know me

<P>for good since I have this coat on my back--a coat that he gave me

<P>freely in the day that he stripped me of my rags.&nbsp; I have, moreover,

<P>a mark in my forehead, of which, perhaps, you have taken no notice,

<P>which one of my Lord's most intimate associates fixed there in the day

<P>that my burden fell off my shoulders.&nbsp; I will tell you, moreover,

<P>that I had then given me a roll, sealed, to comfort me by reading

<P>as I go on the way; I was also bid to give it in at the Celestial Gate,

<P>in token of my certain going in after it; all which things, I doubt,

<P>you want, and want them because you came not in at the gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{102}

<P>&lt;Christian has talk with himself>

<P>To these things they gave him no answer; only they looked upon

<P>each other, and laughed.&nbsp; Then, I saw that they went on all,

<P>save that Christian kept before, who had no more talk but with himself,

<P>and that sometimes sighingly, and sometimes comfortably;

<P>also he would be often reading in the roll that one of the Shining Ones

<P>gave him, by which he was refreshed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{103}

<P>&lt;He comes to the Hill Difficulty>

<P>I beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the foot

<P>of the Hill Difficulty; at the bottom of which was a spring.

<P>There were also in the same place two other ways besides that

<P>which came straight from the gate; one turned to the left hand,

<P>and the other to the right, at the bottom of the hill;

<P>but the narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going
up

<P>the side of the hill is called Difficulty.&nbsp; Christian now went

<P>to the spring, and drank thereof, to refresh himself [Isa. 49:10],

<P>and then began to go up the hill, saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hill, though high, I covet to ascend,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty will not me offend;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I perceive the way to life lies here.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor
fear;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better, though difficult, the right way to
go,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{104}

<P>&lt;The danger of turning out of the way>

<P>The other two also came to the foot of the hill; but when they saw

<P>that the hill was steep and high, and that there were two other ways

<P>to go, and supposing also that these two ways might meet again,

<P>with that up which Christian went, on the other side of the hill,

<P>therefore they were resolved to go in those ways.&nbsp; Now the name
of one

<P>of these ways was Danger, and the name of the other Destruction.

<P>So the one took the way which is called Danger, which led him into

<P>a great wood, and the other took directly up the way to Destruction,

<P>which led him into a wide field, full of dark mountains,

<P>where he stumbled and fell, and rose no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall they who wrong begin yet rightly end?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall they at all have safety for their friend?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no; in headstrong manner they set out,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And headlong will they fall at last no doubt."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{105}

<P>&lt;A ward of grace>

<P>I looked, then, after Christian, to see him go up the hill,

<P>where I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going

<P>to clambering upon his hands and his knees, because of the steepness

<P>of the place.&nbsp; Now, about the midway to the top of the hill

<P>was a pleasant arbour, made by the Lord of the hill for the refreshing

<P>of weary travellers; thither, therefore, Christian got, where also

<P>he sat down to rest him.&nbsp; Then he pulled his roll out of his bosom,

<P>and read therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh to take

<P>a review of the coat or garment that was given him as he stood

<P>by the cross.&nbsp; Thus pleasing himself awhile, he at last fell

<P>into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which detained him

<P>in that place until it was almost night; and in his sleep,

<P>his roll fell out of his hand.&nbsp; &lt;He that sleeps is a loser>

<P>Now, as he was sleeping, there came one to him, and awaked him, saying,

<P>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.

<P>[Prov. 6:6]&nbsp; And with that Christian started up, and sped him on

<P>his way, and went apace, till he came to the top of the hill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{106}

<P>&lt;Christian meets with Mistrust and Timorous>

<P>Now, when he was got up to the top of the hill, there came two men

<P>running to meet him amain; the name of the one was Timorous,

<P>and of the other, Mistrust; to whom Christian said, Sirs,

<P>what's the matter?&nbsp; You run the wrong way.&nbsp; Timorous answered,

<P>that they were going to the City of Zion, and had got up

<P>that difficult place; but, said he, the further we go, the more danger

<P>we meet with; wherefore we turned, and are going back again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yes, said Mistrust, for just before us lie a couple of lions in the
way,

<P>whether sleeping or waking we know not, and we could not think,

<P>if we came within reach, but they would presently pull us in pieces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{107}

<P>&lt;Christian shakes off fear>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, You make me afraid, but whither shall
I fly

<P>to be safe?&nbsp; If I go back to mine own country, that is prepared

<P>for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish there.

<P>If I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in safety there.

<P>I must venture.&nbsp; To go back is nothing but death; to go forward

<P>is fear of death, and life-everlasting beyond it.&nbsp; I will yet

<P>go forward.&nbsp; So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the hill,

<P>and Christian went on his way.&nbsp; &lt;Christian missed his roll

<P>wherein he used to take comfort>&nbsp; But, thinking again of what

<P>he had heard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll,

<P>that he might read therein, and be comforted; but he felt,

<P>and found it not.&nbsp; Then was Christian in great distress,

<P>and knew not what to do; for he wanted that which used to relieve him,

<P>and that which should have been his pass into the Celestial City.

<P>&lt;He is perplexed for his roll>&nbsp; Here, therefore, he begun to
be

<P>much perplexed, and knew not what to do.&nbsp; At last he bethought
himself

<P>that he had slept in the arbour that is on the side of the hill;

<P>and, falling down upon his knees, he asked God's forgiveness for that

<P>his foolish act, and then went back to look for his roll.

<P>But all the way he went back, who can sufficiently set forth the sorrow

<P>of Christian's heart?&nbsp; Sometimes he sighed, sometimes he wept,

<P>and oftentimes he chid himself for being so foolish to fall asleep

<P>in that place, which was erected only for a little refreshment

<P>for his weariness.&nbsp; Thus, therefore, he went back, carefully looking

<P>on this side and on that, all the way as he went, if happily he might

<P>find his roll, that had been his comfort so many times in his journey.

<P>He went thus, till he came again within sight of the arbour

<P>where he sat and slept; but that sight renewed his sorrow the more,

<P>by bringing again, even afresh, his evil of sleeping into his mind.

<P>[Rev. 2:5; 1 Thes. 5:7,8]&nbsp; &lt;Christian bewails his foolish sleeping>

<P>Thus, therefore, he now went on bewailing his sinful sleep, saying,

<P>O wretched man that I am that I should sleep in the day-time!

<P>that I should sleep in the midst of difficulty! that I should

<P>so indulge the flesh, as to use that rest for ease to my flesh,

<P>which the Lord of the hill hath erected only for the relief

<P>of the spirits of pilgrims!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{108}

<P>How many steps have I took in vain! Thus it happened to Israel,

<P>for their sin; they were sent back again by the way of the Red Sea;

<P>and I am made to tread those steps with sorrow, which I might have trod

<P>with delight, had it not been for this sinful sleep.&nbsp; How far might
I

<P>have been on my way by this time!&nbsp; I am made to tread those steps

<P>thrice over, which I needed not to have trod but once; yea,

<P>now also I am like to be benighted, for the day is almost spent.

<P>O, that I had not slept!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{109}

<P>&lt;Christian findeth his roll where he lost it>

<P>Now, by this time he was come to the arbour again, where for a while

<P>he sat down and wept; but at last, as Christian would have it,

<P>looking sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied his roll;

<P>the which he, with trembling and haste, catched up, and put it into

<P>his bosom.&nbsp; But who can tell how joyful this man was when he had
gotten

<P>his roll again! for this roll was the assurance of his life

<P>and acceptance at the desired haven.&nbsp; Therefore he laid it up

<P>in his bosom, gave thanks to God for directing his eye to the place

<P>where it lay, and with joy and tears betook himself again

<P>to his journey.&nbsp; But oh, how nimbly now did he go up the rest

<P>of the hill!&nbsp; Yet, before he got up, the sun went down upon Christian;

<P>and this made him again recall the vanity of his sleeping

<P>to his remembrance; and thus he again began to condole with himself:

<P>O thou sinful sleep; how, for thy sake, am I like to be benighted

<P>in my journey!&nbsp; I must walk without the sun; darkness must cover

<P>the path of my feet; and I must hear the noise of the doleful creatures,

<P>because of my sinful sleep.&nbsp; [1 Thes. 5:6,7]&nbsp; Now also he
remembered

<P>the story that Mistrust and Timorous told him of; how they were frighted

<P>with the sight of the lions.&nbsp; Then said Christian to himself again,

<P>These beasts range in the night for their prey; and if they should

<P>meet with me in the dark, how should I shift them?&nbsp; How should
I escape

<P>being by them torn in pieces?&nbsp; Thus he went on his way.

<P>But while he was thus bewailing his unhappy miscarriage,

<P>he lift up his eyes, and behold there was a very stately palace

<P>before him, the name of which was Beautiful; and it stood just by

<P>the highway side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{110}

<P>So I saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward,

<P>that if possible he might get lodging there.&nbsp; Now, before he had

<P>gone far, he entered into a very narrow passage, which was about

<P>a furlong off the porter's lodge; and looking very narrowly before him

<P>as he went, he espied two lions in the way.&nbsp; Now, thought he,

<P>I see the dangers that Mistrust and Timorous were driven back by.

<P>(The lions were chained, but he saw not the chains.)

<P>Then he was afraid, and thought also himself to go back after them,

<P>for he thought nothing but death was before him.&nbsp; But the porter

<P>at the lodge, whose name is Watchful, perceiving that Christian

<P>made a halt as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying,

<P>Is thy strength so small?&nbsp; [Mark 8:34-37]&nbsp; Fear not the lions,

<P>for they are chained, and are placed there for trial of faith

<P>where it is, and for discovery of those that had none.

<P>Keep in the midst of the path, no hurt shall come unto thee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Difficulty is behind, Fear is before,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he's got on the hill, the lions roar;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Christian man is never long at ease,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one fright's gone, another doth him seize."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{111}

<P>Then I saw that he went on, trembling for fear of the lions,

<P>but taking good heed to the directions of the porter;

<P>he heard them roar, but they did him no harm.&nbsp; Then he clapped

<P>his hands, and went on till he came and stood before the gate

<P>where the porter was.&nbsp; Then said Christian to the porter,

<P>Sir, what house is this?&nbsp; And may I lodge here to-night?

<P>The porter answered, This house was built by the Lord of the hill,

<P>and he built it for the relief and security of pilgrims.

<P>The porter also asked whence he was, and whither he was going.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{112}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am come from the City of Destruction, and am going

<P>to Mount Zion; but because the sun is now set, I desire, if I may,

<P>to lodge here to-night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>POR.&nbsp; What is your name?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; My name is now Christian, but my name at the first was Graceless;

<P>I came of the race of Japheth, whom God will persuade to dwell

<P>in the tents of Shem.&nbsp; [Gen. 9:27]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>POR.&nbsp; But how doth it happen that you come so late?&nbsp; The sun
is set.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{113}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I had been here sooner, but that, "wretched man that I am!"

<P>I slept in the arbour that stands on the hillside; nay, I had,

<P>notwithstanding that, been here much sooner, but that, in my sleep.

<P>I lost my evidence, and came without it to the brow of the hill

<P>and then feeling for it, and finding it not, I was forced

<P>with sorrow of heart, to go back to the place where I slept my sleep,

<P>where I found it, and now I am come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>POR.&nbsp; Well, I will call out one of the virgins of this place, who
will,

<P>if she likes your talk, bring you into the rest of the family,

<P>according to the rules of the house.&nbsp; So Watchful, the porter,

<P>rang a bell, at the sound of which came out at the door of the house,

<P>a grave and beautiful damsel, named Discretion, and asked why

<P>she was called.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{114}

<P>The porter answered, This man is in a journey from

<P>the City of Destruction to Mount Zion, but being weary and benighted,

<P>he asked me if he might lodge here to-night; so I told him I would call

<P>for thee, who, after discourse had with him, mayest do as seemeth

<P>thee good, even according to the law of the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{115}

<P>Then she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going,

<P>and he told her.&nbsp; She asked him also how he got into the way;

<P>and he told her.&nbsp; Then she asked him what he had seen and met with

<P>in the way; and he told, her.&nbsp; And last she asked his name; so
he said,

<P>It is Christian, and I have so much the more a desire to lodge

<P>here to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place was built

<P>by the Lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrims.

<P>So she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes; and after

<P>a little pause, she said, I will call forth two or three more

<P>of the family.&nbsp; So she ran to the door, and called out Prudence,

<P>Piety, and Charity, who, after a little more discourse with him,

<P>had him into the family; and many of them, meeting him at the threshold

<P>of the house, said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord;

<P>this house was built by the Lord of the hill, on purpose to entertain

<P>such pilgrims in.&nbsp; Then he bowed his head, and followed them

<P>into the house.&nbsp; So when he was come in and sat down, they gave
him

<P>something to drink, and consented together, that until supper was ready,

<P>some of them should have some particular discourse with Christian,

<P>for the best improvement of time; and they appointed Piety,

<P>and Prudence, and Charity to discourse with him; and thus they began:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{116}

<P>&lt;Piety discourses him>

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; Come, good Christian, since we have been so loving to you,

<P>to receive you in our house this night, let us, if perhaps we may

<P>better ourselves thereby, talk with you of all things

<P>that have happened to you in your pilgrimage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; With a very good will, and I am glad that you are

<P>so well disposed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{117}

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; What moved you at first to betake yourself to a pilgrim's
life?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;How Christian was driven out of his own country>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; I was driven out of my native country by a dreadful sound

<P>that was in mine ears:&nbsp; to wit, that unavoidable destruction

<P>did attend me, if I abode in that place where I was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; But how did it happen that you came out of your country

<P>this way?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;How he got into the way to Zion>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; It was as God would have it; for when I was under the fears

<P>of destruction, I did not know whither to go; but by chance

<P>there came a man, even to me, as I was trembling and weeping,

<P>whose name is Evangelist, and he directed me to the wicket-gate,

<P>which else I should never have found, and so set me into the way

<P>that hath led me directly to this house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{118}

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; But did you not come by the house of the Interpreter?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;A rehearsal of what he saw in the way>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and did see such things there, the remembrance of which

<P>will stick by me as long as I live; especially three things:&nbsp; to
wit,

<P>how Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains his work of grace

<P>in the heart; how the man had sinned himself quite out of hopes

<P>of God's mercy; and also the dream of him that thought in his sleep

<P>the day of judgement was come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; Why, did you hear him tell his dream?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and a dreadful one it was.&nbsp; I thought it made my
heart ache

<P>as he was telling of it; but yet I am glad I heard it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{119}

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; Was that all that you saw at the house of the Interpreter?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; No; he took me and had me where he shewed me a stately palace,

<P>and how the people were clad in gold that were in it; and how

<P>there came a venturous man and cut his way through the armed men

<P>that stood in the door to keep him out, and how he was bid to come in,

<P>and win eternal glory.&nbsp; Methought those things did ravish my heart!

<P>I would have stayed at that good man's house a twelvemonth,

<P>but that I knew I had further to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{120}

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; And what saw you else in the way?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Saw! why, I went but a little further, and I saw one,

<P>as I thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon the tree;

<P>and the very sight of him made my burden fall off my back,

<P>(for I groaned under a very heavy burden,) but then it fell down

<P>from off me.&nbsp; It was a strange thing to me, for I never saw

<P>such a thing before; yea, and while I stood looking up,

<P>for then I could not forbear looking, three Shining Ones came to me.

<P>One of them testified that my sins were forgiven me; another stripped
me

<P>of my rags, and gave me this broidered coat which you see;

<P>and the third set the mark which you see in my forehead, and gave me

<P>this sealed roll.&nbsp; (And with that he plucked it out of his bosom.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{121}

<P>PIETY.&nbsp; But you saw more than this, did you not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; The things that I have told you were the best;

<P>yet some other matters I saw, as, namely--I saw three men,

<P>Simple, Sloth, and Presumption, lie asleep a little out of the way,

<P>as I came, with irons upon their heels; but do you think

<P>I could awake them?&nbsp; I also saw Formality and Hypocrisy come

<P>tumbling over the wall, to go, as they pretended, to Zion,

<P>but they were quickly lost, even as I myself did tell them;

<P>but they would not believe.&nbsp; But above all, I found it hard work

<P>to get up this hill, and as hard to come by the lions' mouths,

<P>and truly if it had not been for the good man, the porter that stands

<P>at the gate, I do not know but that after all I might have

<P>gone back again; but now I thank God I am here, and I thank you

<P>for receiving of me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{122}

<P>Then Prudence thought good to ask him a few questions,

<P>and desired his answer to them.

came?

<P>I might have had opportunity to have returned; but now I desire

<P>a better country, that is, an heavenly."&nbsp; [Heb. 11:15,16]

<P>to fasten upon others for their good.&nbsp; Yet this I can say,

<P>I was very wary of giving them occasion, by any unseemly action,

<P>to make them averse to going on pilgrimage.&nbsp; Yea, for this very
thing

<P>they would tell me I was too precise, and that I denied myself

<P>of things, for their sakes, in which they saw no evil.&nbsp; Nay,

<P>I think I may say, that if what they saw in me did hinder them,

<P>CHAR.&nbsp; Indeed Cain hated his brother, "because his own works were
evil,

<P>and his brother's righteous" [1 John 3:12]; and if thy wife and children

<P>have been offended with thee for this, they thereby show themselves

<P>&lt;What Christian had to his supper>

<P>they sat down to meat.&nbsp; &lt;Their talk at supper time>&nbsp; Now
the table

<P>was furnished "with fat things, and with wine that was well refined":

<P>and all their talk at the table was about the Lord of the hill;

<P>as, namely, about what he had done, and wherefore he did what he did,

<P>and why he had builded that house.&nbsp; And by what they said,

<P>I perceived that he had been a great warrior, and had fought with

<P>and slain "him that had the Power of death", but not without

<P>great danger to himself, which made me love him the more.

<P>[Heb. 2:14,15]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{129}

<P>For, as they said, and as I believe (said Christian), he did it with

<P>the loss of much blood; but that which put glory of grace

<P>into all he did, was, that he did it out of pure love to his country.

<P>And besides, there were some of them of the household that said

<P>they had been and spoke with him since he did die on the cross;

<P>and they have attested that they had it from his own lips,

<P>that he is such a lover of poor pilgrims, that the like is not

<P>to be found from the east to the west.

<P>&lt;Christ makes princes of beggars>

<P>They, moreover, gave an instance of what they affirmed, and that was,

<P>he had stripped himself of his glory, that he might do this

<P>for the poor; and that they heard him say and affirm,

<P>"that he would not dwell in the mountain of Zion alone."

<P>They said, moreover, that he had made many pilgrims princes,

<P>though by nature they were beggars born, and their original

<P>had been the dunghill.&nbsp; [1 Sam 2:8; Ps. 113:7]

<P>Thus they discoursed together till late at night; and after

<P>they had committed themselves to their Lord for protection,

<P>they betook themselves to rest:&nbsp; the Pilgrim they laid

<P>in a large upper chamber, whose window opened towards the sun-rising:

<P>the name of the chamber was Peace; where he slept till break of day,

<P>and then he awoke and sang--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I now?&nbsp; Is this the love and
care

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Jesus for the men that pilgrims are?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus to provide! that I should be forgiven!

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{132}

<P>&lt;Christian had into the study, and what he saw there>

<P>So in the morning they all got up; and, after some more discourse,

<P>they told him that he should not depart till they had shown him

<P>the rarities of that place.&nbsp; And first they had him into the study,

<P>where they showed him records of the greatest antiquity; in which,

<P>as I remember my dream, they showed him first the pedigree of the Lord

<P>of the hill, that he was the son of the Ancient of Days, and came by

<P>that eternal generation.&nbsp; Here also was more fully recorded the
acts

<P>that he had done, and the names of many hundreds that he had taken

<P>into his service; and how he had placed them in such habitations that

<P>could neither by length of days, nor decays of nature, be dissolved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{133}

<P>Then they read to him some of the worthy acts that some of his servants

<P>had done:&nbsp; as, how they had "subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,

<P>obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence

<P>of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness

<P>were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight

<P>the armies of the aliens."&nbsp; [Heb 11:33,34]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{134}

<P>They then read again, in another part of the records of the house,

<P>where it was shewed how willing their Lord was to receive

<P>into his favour any, even any, though they in time past had offered

<P>great affronts to his person and proceedings.&nbsp; Here also were

<P>several other histories of many other famous things, of all which

<P>Christian had a view; as of things both ancient and modern;

<P>together with prophecies and predictions of things that have

<P>their certain accomplishment, both to the dread and amazement

<P>of enemies, and the comfort and solace of pilgrims.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{135}

<P>&lt;Christian had into the armoury>

<P>The next day they took him and had him into the armoury,

<P>where they showed him all manner of furniture, which their Lord

<P>had provided for pilgrims, as sword, shield, helmet, breastplate,

<P>ALL-PRAYER, and shoes that would not wear out.&nbsp; And there was here

<P>enough of this to harness out as many men for the service of their Lord

<P>as there be stars in the heaven for multitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{136}

<P>&lt;Christian is made to see ancient things>

<P>They also showed him some of the engines with which some of his servants

<P>had done wonderful things.&nbsp; They shewed him Moses' rod;

<P>the hammer and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers, trumpets,

<P>and lamps too, with which Gideon put to flight the armies of Midian.

<P>Then they showed him the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar slew

<P>six hundred men.&nbsp; They showed him also the jaw-bone with which
Samson

<P>did such mighty feats.&nbsp; They showed him, moreover, the sling and
stone

<P>with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword, also,

<P>with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in the day

<P>that he shall rise up to the prey.&nbsp; They showed him, besides,

<P>many excellent things, with which Christian was much delighted.

<P>This done, they went to their rest again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{137}

<P>&lt;Christian showed the Delectable Mountains>

<P>Then I saw in my dream, that on the morrow he got up to go forward;

<P>but they desired him to stay till the next day also;

<P>and then, said they, we will, if the day be clear, show you

<P>the Delectable Mountains, which, they said, would yet further add

<P>to his comfort, because they were nearer the desired haven

<P>than the place where at present he was; so he consented and stayed.

<P>When the morning was up, they had him to the top of the house,

<P>and bid him look south; so he did:&nbsp; and behold, at a great distance,

<P>he saw a most pleasant mountainous country, beautified with woods,

<P>vineyards, fruits of all sorts, flowers also, with springs

<P>and fountains, very delectable to behold.&nbsp; [Isa. 33:16,17]

<P>Then he asked the name of the country.&nbsp; They said it was

<P>Immanuel's Land; and it is as common, said they, as this hill is,

<P>to and for all the pilgrims.&nbsp; And when thou comest there from thence,

<P>said they, thou mayest see to the gate of the Celestial City,

<P>&lt;Christian sets forward>

<P>Now he bethought himself of setting forward, and they were willing

<P>he should.&nbsp; But first, said they, let us go again into the armoury.

<P>&lt;Christian sent away armed>&nbsp; So they did; and when they came
there,

<P>they harnessed him from head to foot with what was of proof,

<P>lest, perhaps, he should meet with assaults in the way.&nbsp; He being,

<P>therefore, thus accoutred, walketh out with his friends to the gate,

<P>and there he asked the porter if he saw any pilgrims pass by.

<P>Then the porter answered, Yes.

<P>{139}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, did you know him? said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>POR.&nbsp; I asked him his name, and he told me it was Faithful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Oh, said Christian, I know him; he is my townsman,

<P>my near neighbour; he comes from the place where I was born.

<P>How far do you think he may be before?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>POR.&nbsp; He is got by this time below the hill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;How Christian and the Porter greet at parting>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, said Christian, good Porter, the Lord be with thee,

<P>and add to all thy blessings much increase, for the kindness that thou

<P>hast showed to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{140}

<P>&lt;The Valley of Humiliation>

<P>Then he began to go forward; but Discretion, Piety, Charity,

<P>and Prudence would accompany him down to the foot of the hill.

<P>So they went on together, reiterating their former discourses,

<P>till they came to go down the hill.&nbsp; Then said Christian,

<P>As it was difficult coming up, so, so far as I can see, it is dangerous

<P>going down.&nbsp; Yes, said Prudence, so it is, for it is a hard matter

<P>for a man to go down into the Valley of Humiliation, as thou art now,

<P>and to catch no slip by the way; therefore, said they, are we come out

<P>to accompany thee down the hill.&nbsp; So he began to go down,

<P>but very warily; yet he caught a slip or two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{141}

<P>Then I saw in my dream that these good companions, when Christian

<P>was gone to the bottom of the hill, gave him a loaf of bread,

<P>a bottle of wine, and a cluster of raisins; and then he went on his
way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Christian has no armour for his back>

<P>But now, in this Valley of Humiliation, poor Christian was hard put

<P>to it; for he had gone but a little way, before he espied a foul fiend

<P>coming over the field to meet him; his name is Apollyon.

<P>Then did Christian begin to be afraid, and to cast in his mind

<P>whether to go back or to stand his ground.&nbsp; But he considered again

<P>that he had no armour for his back; and therefore thought

<P>that to turn the back to him might give him the greater advantage

<P>with ease to pierce him with his darts.&nbsp; &lt;Christian's resolution

<P>at the approach of Apollyon>&nbsp; Therefore he resolved to venture

<P>and stand his ground; for, thought he, had I no more in mine eye

<P>than the saving of my life, it would be the best way to stand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{142}

<P>So he went on, and Apollyon met him.&nbsp; Now the monster was

<P>hideous to behold; he was clothed with scales, like a fish,

<P>(and they are his pride,) he had wings like a dragon, feet like a bear,

<P>and out of his belly came fire and smoke, and his mouth was as

<P>the mouth of a lion.&nbsp; When he was come up to Christian, he beheld
him

<P>with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to question with him.

the way,

<P>and said, I am void of fear in this matter:&nbsp; prepare thyself to

<P>a shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and so prevented

<P>&lt;Christian wounded in his understanding, faith, and conversation>

<P>Then did Christian draw, for he saw it was time to bestir him;

<P>and Apollyon as fast made at him, throwing darts as thick as hail;

<P>by the which, notwithstanding all that Christian could do to avoid it,

<P>Apollyon wounded him in his head, his hand, and foot.

<P>This made Christian give a little back; Apollyon, therefore,

<P>followed his work amain, and Christian again took courage,

<P>and resisted as manfully as he could.&nbsp; This sore combat lasted

<P>for above half a day, even till Christian was almost quite spent;

<P>for you must know that Christian, by reason of his wounds,

<P>must needs grow weaker and weaker.
