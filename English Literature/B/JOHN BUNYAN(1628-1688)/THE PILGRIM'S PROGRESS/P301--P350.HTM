<P>The Shepherds then answered, Did you not see a little below

<P>these mountains a stile, that led into a meadow, on the left hand

<P>of this way?&nbsp; They answered, Yes.&nbsp; Then said the Shepherds,

<P>From that stile there goes a path that leads directly

<P>to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair, and these,

<P>pointing to them among the tombs, came once on pilgrimage,

<P>as you do now, even till they came to that same stile;

<P>and because the right way was rough in that place, they chose to go

<P>out of it into that meadow, and there were taken by Giant Despair,

<P>and cast into Doubting Castle; where, after they had been a while

<P>kept in the dungeon, he at last did put out their eyes,

<P>and led them among those tombs, where he has left them to wander

<P>to this very day, that the saying of the wise man might be fulfilled,

<P>"He that wandereth out of the way of understanding, shall remain in

<P>the congregation of the dead."&nbsp; [Pro. 21:16]&nbsp; Then Christian
and Hopeful

<P>looked upon one another, with tears gushing out, but yet said nothing

<P>to the Shepherds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{302}

<P>&lt;A by-way to hell>

<P>Then I saw in my dream, that the Shepherds had them to another place,

<P>in a bottom, where was a door in the side of a hill,

<P>and they opened the door, and bid them look in.&nbsp; They looked in,

<P>therefore, and saw that within it was very dark and smoky;

<P>they also thought that they heard there a rumbling noise as of fire,

<P>and a cry of some tormented, and that they smelt the scent of brimstone.

<P>Then said Christian, What means this?&nbsp; The Shepherds told them,

<P>This is a by-way to hell, a way that hypocrites go in at; namely,

<P>such as sell their birthright, with Esau; such as sell their master,

<P>with Judas; such as blaspheme the gospel, with Alexander;

<P>and that lie and dissemble, with Ananias and Sapphira his wife.

<P>Then said Hopeful to the Shepherds, I perceive that these had on them,

<P>even every one, a show of pilgrimage, as we have now; had they not?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{303}

<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Yes, and held it a long time too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; How far might they go on in pilgrimage in their day,

<P>since they notwithstanding were thus miserably cast away?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Some further, and some not so far, as these mountains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then said the Pilgrims one to another, We have need to cry to the Strong

<P>for strength.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Ay, and you will have need to use it, when you have it,
too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{304}

<P>&lt;The Shepherds' perspective glass>

<P>By this time the Pilgrims had a desire to go forward,

<P>and the Shepherds a desire they should; so they walked together

<P>towards the end of the mountains.&nbsp; Then said the Shepherds

<P>one to another, Let us here show to the Pilgrims the gates

<P>of the Celestial City, if they have skill to look through

<P>our perspective glass.&nbsp; &lt;The Hill Clear>&nbsp; The Pilgrims
then

<P>lovingly accepted the motion; so they had them to the top

<P>of a high hill, called Clear, and gave them their glass to look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{305}

<P>&lt;The fruits of servile fear>

<P>Then they essayed to look, but the remembrance of that last thing

<P>that the Shepherds had shown them, made their hands shake;

<P>by means of which impediment, they could not look steadily

<P>through the glass; yet they thought they saw something like the gate,

<P>and also some of the glory of the place.&nbsp; Then they went away,

<P>and sang this song--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by the Shepherds, secrets are reveal'd,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which from all other men are kept conceal'd.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to the Shepherds, then, if you would see

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things deep, things hid, and that mysterious
be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{306}

<P>&lt;A twofold caution>

<P>When they were about to depart, one of the Shepherds gave them a note

<P>of the way.&nbsp; Another of them bid them beware of the Flatterer.

<P>The third bid them take heed that they sleep not upon

<P>the Enchanted Ground.&nbsp; And the fourth bid them God-speed.

<P>So I awoke from my dream.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{307}

<P>&lt;The Country of Conceit, out of which came Ignorance>

<P>And I slept, and dreamed again, and saw the same two Pilgrims

<P>going down the mountains along the highway towards the city.

<P>Now, a little below these mountains, on the left hand,

<P>lieth the country of Conceit; from which country there comes

<P>into the way in which the Pilgrims walked, a little crooked lane.

<P>Here, therefore, they met with a very brisk lad, that came out

<P>of that country; and his name was Ignorance.&nbsp; So Christian asked
him

<P>from what parts he came, and whither he was going.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{308}

<P>&lt;Christian and Ignorance have some talk>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Sir, I was born in the country that lieth off there

<P>a little on the left hand, and I am going to the Celestial City.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But how do you think to get in at the gate? for you may find

<P>some difficulty there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; As other people do, said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what have you to show at that gate, that may cause

<P>that the gate should be opened to you?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The ground of Ignorance's hope>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I know my Lord's will, and I have been a good liver;

<P>I pay every man his own; I pray, fast, pay tithes, and give alms,

<P>and have left my country for whither I am going.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{309}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But thou camest not in at the wicket-gate that is at the
head

<P>of this way; thou camest in hither through that same crooked lane,

<P>and therefore, I fear, however thou mayest think of thyself,

<P>when the reckoning day shall come, thou wilt have laid to thy charge

<P>that thou art a thief and a robber, instead of getting admittance

<P>into the city.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;He saith to every one that he is a fool>

<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Gentlemen, ye be utter strangers to me, I know you not;

<P>be content and follow the religion of your country, and I will follow

<P>the religion of mine.&nbsp; I hope all will be well.&nbsp; And as for
the gate

<P>that you talk of, all the world knows that that is a great way off

<P>of our country.&nbsp; I cannot think that any man in all our parts

<P>doth so much as know the way to it, nor need they matter

<P>whether they do or no, since we have, as you see, a fine,

<P>pleasant green lane, that comes down from our country,

<P>the next way into the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{310}

<P>&lt;How to carry it to a fool>

<P>When Christian saw that the man was "wise in his own conceit",

<P>he said to Hopeful, whisperingly, "There is more hope of a fool than

<P>of him."&nbsp; [Prov. 26:12]&nbsp; And said, moreover, "When he that
is a fool

<P>walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one

<P>that he is a fool."&nbsp; [Eccl. 10:3]&nbsp; What, shall we talk further
with him,

<P>or out-go him at present, and so leave him to think of what

<P>he hath heard already, and then stop again for him afterwards,

<P>and see if by degrees we can do any good to him?&nbsp; Then said Hopeful--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Ignorance a little while now muse

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On what is said, and let him not refuse

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good counsel to embrace, lest he remain

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still ignorant of what's the chiefest gain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God saith, those that no understanding have,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he made them, them he will not save.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; He further added, It is not good, I think, to say all to
him

<P>at once; let us pass him by, if you will, and talk to him anon,

<P>even as he is able to bear it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{311}

<P>&lt;The destruction of one Turn-away>

<P>So they both went on, and Ignorance he came after.&nbsp; Now when they
had

<P>passed him a little way, they entered into a very dark lane,

<P>where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with

<P>seven strong cords, and were carrying of him back to the door

<P>that they saw on the side of the hill.&nbsp; [Matt. 12:45, Prov. 5:22]

<P>Now good Christian began to tremble, and so did Hopeful his companion;

<P>yet as the devils led away the man, Christian looked to see

<P>if he knew him; and he thought it might be one Turn-away,

<P>that dwelt in the town of Apostasy.&nbsp; But he did not perfectly see

<P>his face, for he did hang his head like a thief that is found.

<P>But being once past, Hopeful looked after him, and espied on his back

<P>a paper with this inscription, "Wanton professor and damnable apostate".

<P>&lt;Christian telleth his companion a story of Little-faith>

<P>Then said Christian to his fellow, Now I call to remembrance,

<P>that which was told me of a thing that happened to a good man hereabout.

<P>The name of the man was Little-faith, but a good man, and he dwelt

<P>in the town of Sincere.&nbsp; The thing was this:--&nbsp; At the entering
in

<P>at this passage, &lt;Broad-way Gate> there comes down from Broad-way
Gate,

<P>&lt;Dead Man's Lane> a lane called Dead Man's Lane; so called because
of

<P>the murders that are commonly done there; and this Little-faith

<P>going on pilgrimage, as we do now, chanced to sit down there, and slept.

<P>Now there happened, at that time, to come down the lane,

<P>from Broad-way Gate, three sturdy rogues, and their names

<P>were Faint-heart, Mistrust, and Guilt, (three brothers),

<P>and they espying Little-faith, where he was, came galloping up

<P>with speed.&nbsp; Now the good man was just awake from his sleep,

<P>and was getting up to go on his journey.&nbsp; So they came up all to
him,

<P>and with threatening language bid him stand.&nbsp; At this

<P>Little-faith looked as white as a clout, and had neither power to fight

<P>nor fly.&nbsp; &lt;Little-faith robbed by Faint-heart, Mistrust and
Guilt>

<P>Then said Faint-heart, Deliver thy purse.&nbsp; &lt;They got away his
silver,

<P>and knocked him down>&nbsp; But he making no haste to do it

<P>(for he was loath to lose his money), Mistrust ran up to him,

<P>and thrusting his hand into his pocket, pulled out thence

<P>a bag of silver.&nbsp; Then he cried out, Thieves! Thieves!&nbsp; With
that Guilt,

<P>with a great club that was in his hand, struck Little-faith on the head,

<P>and with that blow felled him flat to the ground, where he lay bleeding

<P>as one that would bleed to death.&nbsp; All this while the thieves stood
by.

<P>But, at last, they hearing that some were upon the road,

<P>and fearing lest it should be one Great-grace, that dwells in the city

<P>of Good-confidence, they betook themselves to their heels,

<P>and left this good man to shift for himself.&nbsp; Now, after a while,

<P>Little-faith came to himself, and getting up, made shift

<P>to scrabble on his way.&nbsp; This was the story.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{312}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But did they take from him all that ever he had?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Little-faith lost not his best things>

<P>Chr. No; the place where his jewels were they never ransacked,

<P>so those he kept still.&nbsp; But, as I was told, the good man

<P>was much afflicted for his loss, for the thieves got most of

<P>his spending-money.&nbsp; &lt;Little-faith forced to beg to his journey's
end>

<P>That which they got not (as I said) were jewels, also he had

<P>a little odd money left, but scarce enough to bring him to

<P>his journey's end [1 Peter 4:18]; nay, if I was not misinformed,

<P>he was forced to beg as he went, to keep himself alive;

<P>for his jewels he might not sell.&nbsp; But beg, and do what he could,

<P>he went (as we say) with many a hungry belly the most part

<P>of the rest of the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{313}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But is it not a wonder they got not from him his certificate,

<P>by which he was to receive his admittance at the Celestial Gate?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;He kept not his best things by his own cunning.&nbsp; [2 Tim. 1:14]>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; It is a wonder; but they got not that, though they missed
it

<P>not through any good cunning of his; for he, being dismayed with

<P>their coming upon him, had neither power nor skill to hide anything;

<P>so it was more by good Providence than by his endeavour,

<P>that they missed of that good thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{314}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But it must needs be a comfort to him, that they got not

<P>his jewels from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; It might have been great comfort to him, had he used it

<P>as he should; but they that told me the story said, that he made

<P>but little use of it all the rest of the way, and that because

<P>of the dismay that he had in the taking away his money; indeed,

<P>he forgot it a great part of the rest of his journey; and besides,

<P>when at any time it came into his mind, and he began to be

<P>comforted therewith, then would fresh thoughts of his loss come again

<P>upon him, and those thoughts would swallow up all.&nbsp; [1 Peter 1:9]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{315}

<P>&lt;He is pitied by both>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Alas! poor man! This could not but be a great grief to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Grief! ay, a grief indeed. Would it not have been so to any
of us,

<P>had we been used as he, to be robbed, and wounded too,

<P>and that in a strange place, as he was?&nbsp; It is a wonder he did
not

<P>die with grief, poor heart!&nbsp; I was told that he scattered almost

<P>all the rest of the way with nothing but doleful and bitter complaints;

<P>telling also to all that overtook him, or that he overtook in the way

<P>as he went, where he was robbed, and how; who they were that did it,

<P>and what he lost; how he was wounded, and that he hardly escaped

<P>with his life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{316}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But it is a wonder that his necessity did not put him upon

<P>selling or pawning some of his jewels, that he might have wherewith

<P>to relieve himself in his journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Christian snubbeth his fellow for unadvised speaking>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Thou talkest like one upon whose head is the shell

<P>to this very day; for what should he pawn them, or to whom

<P>should he sell them?&nbsp; In all that country where he was robbed,

<P>his jewels were not accounted of; nor did he want that relief

<P>which could from thence be administered to him.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>had his jewels been missing at the gate of the Celestial City,

<P>he had (and that he knew well enough) been excluded from

<P>an inheritance there; and that would have been worse to him

<P>than the appearance and villainy of ten thousand thieves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{317}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why art thou so tart, my brother?&nbsp; Esau sold his birthright,

<P>and that for a mess of pottage, and that birthright was

<P>his greatest jewel; and if he, why might not Little-faith do so too?

<P>[Heb. 12:16]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;A discourse about Esau and Little-faith>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Esau did sell his birthright indeed, and so do many besides,

<P>and by so doing exclude themselves from the chief blessing,

<P>as also that caitiff did; but you must put a difference betwixt

<P>Esau and Little-faith, and also betwixt their estates.

<P>&lt;Esau was ruled by his lusts>&nbsp; Esau's birthright was typical,

<P>but Little-faith's jewels were not so; Esau's belly was his god,

<P>but Little-faith's belly was not so; Esau's want lay

<P>in his fleshly appetite, Little-faith's did not so.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>Esau could see no further than to the fulfilling of his lusts;

<P>"Behold, I am at the point to die, (said he), and what profit

<P>shall this birthright do me?"&nbsp; [Gen. 25:32]&nbsp; But Little-faith,

<P>though it was his lot to have but a little faith, was by his

<P>little faith kept from such extravagances, and made to see and prize

<P>his jewels more than to sell them, as Esau did his birthright.

<P>&lt;Esau never had faith>&nbsp; You read not anywhere that Esau had
faith, no,

<P>not so much as a little; therefore, no marvel if, where the flesh only

<P>bears sway, (as it will in that man where no faith is to resist),

<P>if he sells his birthright, and his soul and all, and that to

<P>the devil of hell; for it is with such, as it is with the ass,

<P>who in her occasions cannot be turned away.&nbsp; [Jer. 2:24]

<P>When their minds are set upon their lusts, they will have them

<P>whatever they cost.&nbsp; &lt;Little-faith could not live upon Esau's
pottage>

<P>But Little-faith was of another temper, his mind was on things divine;

<P>his livelihood was upon things that were spiritual, and from above;

<P>therefore, to what end should he that is of such a temper

<P>sell his jewels (had there been any that would have bought them)

<P>to fill his mind with empty things?&nbsp; &lt;A comparison between

<P>the turtle-dove and the crow>&nbsp; Will a man give a penny to fill
his belly

<P>with hay; or can you persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion

<P>like the crow?&nbsp; Though faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn,

<P>or mortgage, or sell what they have, and themselves outright to boot;

<P>yet they that have faith, saving faith, though but a little of it,

<P>cannot do so.&nbsp; Here, therefore, my brother, is thy mistake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{318}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I acknowledge it; but yet your severe reflection

<P>had almost made me angry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, I did but compare thee to some of the birds that are

<P>of the brisker sort, who will run to and fro in untrodden paths,

<P>with the shell upon their heads; but pass by that, and consider

<P>the matter under debate, and all shall be well betwixt thee and me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Hopeful swaggers>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But, Christian, these three fellows, I am persuaded in my
heart,

<P>are but a company of cowards; would they have run else, think you,

<P>as they did, at the noise of one that was coming on the road?

<P>Why did not Little-faith pluck up a greater heart?&nbsp; He might, methinks,

<P>have stood one brush with them, and have yielded when

<P>there had been no remedy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;No great heart for God, where there is but little faith>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; That they are cowards, many have said, but few have found
it so

<P>in the time of trial.&nbsp; As for a great heart, Little-faith had none;

<P>and I perceive by thee, my brother, hadst thou been the man concerned,

<P>thou art but for a brush, and then to yield.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;We have more courage when out, than when in the conflict>

<P>And, verily, since this is the height of thy stomach,

<P>now they are at a distance from us, should they appear to thee

<P>as they did to him they might put thee to second thoughts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{319}

<P>&lt;Christian tells his own experience in this case>

<P>But, consider again, they are but journeymen thieves,

<P>they serve under the king of the bottomless pit, who, if need be,

<P>will come into their aid himself, and his voice is as

<P>the roaring of a lion.&nbsp; [1 Pet. 5:8]&nbsp; I myself have been engaged

<P>as this Little-faith was, and I found it a terrible thing.

<P>These three villains set upon me, and I beginning, like a Christian,

<P>to resist, they gave but a call, and in came their master.&nbsp; I would,

<P>as the saying is, have given my life for a penny, but that,

<P>as God would have it, I was clothed with armour of proof.

<P>Ay, and yet, though I was so harnessed, I found it hard work

<P>to quit myself like a man.&nbsp; No man can tell what in that combat

<P>attends us, but he that hath been in the battle himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{320}

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Well, but they ran, you see, when they did but suppose

<P>that one Great-grace was in the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;The King's champion>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; True, they have often fled, both they and their master,

<P>when Great-grace hath but appeared; and no marvel; for he is

<P>the King's champion.&nbsp; But, I trow, you will put some difference
betwixt

<P>Little-faith and the King's champion.&nbsp; All the King's subjects
are not

<P>his champions, nor can they, when tried, do such feats of war as he.

<P>Is it meet to think that a little child should handle Goliath

<P>as David did?&nbsp; Or that there should be the strength of an ox in
a wren?

<P>Some are strong, some are weak; some have great faith, some have little.

<P>This man was one of the weak, and therefore he went to the wall.

<P>for I must tell you, that though Great-grace is excellent good

<P>at his weapons, and has, and can, so long as he keeps them

<P>at sword's point, do well enough with them; yet, if they get within
him,

<P>even Faint-heart, Mistrust, or the other, it shall go hard

<P>but they will throw up his heels.&nbsp; And when a man is down, you
know,

<P>what can he do?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{322}

<P>Whoso looks well upon Great-grace's face, shall see those scars

<P>and cuts there, that shall easily give demonstration of what I say.

<P>Yea, once I heard that he should say, (and that when he

<P>was in the combat), "We despaired even of life."&nbsp; How did these

<P>sturdy rogues and their fellows make David groan, mourn, and roar?

<P>Yea, Heman, and Hezekiah, too, though champions in their day,

<P>were forced to bestir them, when by these assaulted; and yet,

<P>notwithstanding, they had their coats soundly brushed by them.&nbsp;
Peter,

<P>upon a time, would go try what he could do; but though some do say

<P>of him that he is the prince of the apostles, they handled him so,

<P>that they made him at last afraid of a sorry girl.

<P>&lt;Leviathan's sturdiness>

<P>Besides, their king is at their whistle.&nbsp; He is never out of hearing;

<P>and if at any time they be put to the worst, he, if possible,

<P>comes in to help them; and of him it is said, The sword of him

<P>that layeth at him cannot hold the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon;

<P>he esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.&nbsp; The arrow
cannot

<P>make him flee; sling stones are turned with him into stubble.

<P>Darts are counted as stubble:&nbsp; he laugheth at the shaking of a
spear.

<P>[Job 41:26-29]&nbsp; What can a man do in this case?&nbsp; &lt;The excellent
mettle

<P>that is in Job's horse>&nbsp; It is true, if a man could, at every turn,

<P>have Job's horse, and had skill and courage to ride him,

<P>he might do notable things; for his neck is clothed with thunder,

<P>he will not be afraid of the grasshopper; the glory of his nostrils

<P>is terrible: he paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength,

<P>he goeth on to meet the armed men.&nbsp; He mocketh at fear,

<P>and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the sword.

<P>The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear, and the shield.

<P>He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, neither believeth
he

<P>that it is the sound of the trumpet.&nbsp; He saith among the trumpets,

<P>Ha, ha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of

<P>the captains, and the shouting.&nbsp; [Job 39:19-25]
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{324}

<P>But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire to meet
with

<P>an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we hear of others

<P>that they have been foiled, Nor be tickled at the thoughts

<P>of our own manhood; for such commonly come by the worst when tried.

<P>Witness Peter, of whom I made mention before.&nbsp; He would swagger,
ay,

<P>he would; he would, as his vain mind prompted him to say, do better,

<P>and stand more for his Master than all men; but who so foiled,

<P>and run down by these villains, as he?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When, therefore, we hear that such robberies are done on

<P>the King's highway, two things become us to do:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{325}

<P>1.&nbsp; To go out harnessed, and to be sure to take a shield with us;

<P>for it was for want of that, that he that laid so lustily at Leviathan

<P>could not make him yield; for, indeed, if that be wanting,

<P>he fears us not at all.&nbsp; Therefore, he that had skill hath said,

<P>"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able

<P>to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."&nbsp; [Eph. 6:16]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{326}

<P>&lt;It is good to have a convoy>

<P>2.&nbsp; It is good, also, that we desire of the King a convoy,

<P>yea, that he will go with us himself.&nbsp; This made David rejoice

<P>when in the Valley of the Shadow of Death; and Moses was rather

<P>for dying where he stood, than to go one step without his God.

<P>[Exo. 33:15]&nbsp; Oh, my brother, if he will but go along with us,

<P>what need we be afraid of ten thousands that shall set themselves

<P>against us?&nbsp; [Ps. 3:5-8, 27:1-3]&nbsp; But, without him, the proud
helpers

<P>"fall under the slain".&nbsp; [Isa. 10:4]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{327}

<P>I, for my part, have been in the fray before now; and though,

<P>through the goodness of him that is best, I am, as you see, alive,

<P>yet I cannot boast of my manhood.&nbsp; Glad shall I be, if I meet with

<P>no more such brunts; though I fear we are not got beyond all danger.

<P>However, since the lion and the bear have not as yet devoured me,

<P>I hope God will also deliver us from the next uncircumcised Philistine.

<P>Then sang Christian--

thieves?

came

<P>at a place where they saw a way put itself into their way,

<P>and seemed withal to lie as straight as the way which they should go:

<P>and here they knew not which of the two to take, for both seemed

<P>straight before them; therefore, here they stood still to consider.

<P>&lt;The Flatterer finds them>&nbsp; And as they were thinking about
the way,

<P>behold a man, black of flesh, but covered with a very light robe,

<P>came to them, and asked them why they stood there.&nbsp; They answered

<P>they were going to the Celestial City, but knew not which of these ways

<P>to take.&nbsp; Follow me, said the man, it is thither that I am going.

<P>&lt;Christian and his fellow deluded>&nbsp; So they followed him in
the way

<P>that but now came into the road, which by degrees turned,

<P>and turned them so from the city that they desired to go to,

<P>that, in little time, their faces were turned away from it;

<P>yet they followed him.&nbsp; But by and by, before they were aware,

<P>he led them both within the compass of a net, in which they were both

<P>so entangled that they knew not what to do; and with that

<P>the white robe fell off the black man's back.&nbsp; &lt;They are taken
in a net>

<P>Then they saw where they were.&nbsp; Wherefore, there they lay crying

<P>some time, for they could not get themselves out.

<P>{329}

<P>&lt;They bewail their condition>

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to his fellow, Now do I see myself in
error.

<P>Did not the Shepherds bid us beware of the flatterers?

<P>As is the saying of the wise man, so we have found it this day.

<P>A man that flattereth his neighbour, spreadeth a net for his feet.

<P>[Prov. 29:5]

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;A Shining One comes to them with a whip in his hand>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; They also gave us a note of directions about the way,

<P>for our more sure finding thereof; but therein we have also forgotten

<P>to read, and have not kept ourselves from the paths of the destroyer.

<P>Here David was wiser than we; for, saith he, "Concerning the works

<P>of men, by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths

<P>of the destroyer."&nbsp; [Ps. 17:4]&nbsp; Thus they lay bewailing themselves

<P>in the net.&nbsp; At last they espied a Shining One coming towards them

<P>with a whip of small cord in his hand.&nbsp; When he was come

<P>to the place where they were, he asked them whence they came,

<P>and what they did there.&nbsp; They told him that they were poor pilgrims

<P>going to Zion, but were led out of their way by a black man,

<P>clothed in white, who bid us, said they, follow him,

<P>for he was going thither too.&nbsp; Then said he with the whip,

<P>It is Flatterer, a false apostle, that hath transformed himself

<P>into an angel of light.&nbsp; [Prov. 29:5, Dan. 11:32, 2 Cor. 11:13,14]

<P>So he rent the net, and let the men out.&nbsp; Then said he to them,

<P>Follow me, that I may set you in your way again.&nbsp; So he led them
back

<P>to the way which they had left to follow the Flatterer.

<P>Then he asked them, saying, Where did you lie the last night?

<P>They said, With the Shepherds upon the Delectable Mountains.

<P>&lt;They are examined, and convicted of forgetfulness>&nbsp; He asked
them then

<P>if they had not of those Shepherds a note of direction for the way.

<P>They answered, Yes.&nbsp; But did you, said he, when you were at a stand,

<P>pluck out and read your note?&nbsp; They answered, No.&nbsp; He asked
them, Why?

<P>They said, they forgot.&nbsp; He asked, moreover, if the Shepherds did
not

<P>bid them beware of the Flatterer?&nbsp; &lt;Deceivers fine spoken>

<P>They answered, Yes, but we did not imagine, said they,

<P>{330}

<P>&lt;They are whipped and sent on their way>

<P>Then I saw in my dream that he commanded them to lie down; which,

<P>when they did, he chastised them sore, to teach them the good way

<P>wherein they should walk [Deut. 25:2]; and as he chastised them he said,

<P>"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore,

<P>and repent."&nbsp; [2 Chron. 6:26,27, Rev. 3:19]&nbsp; This done, he
bid them

<P>go on their way, and take good heed to the other directions

<P>of the shepherds.&nbsp; So they thanked him for all his kindness,

<P>and went softly along the right way, singing--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come hither, you that walk along the way;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See how the pilgrims fare that go astray.

<P>was turned against it), it would be double torment to me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And how did you do then?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;When he could no longer shake off his guilt by sinful courses,

I,

<P>I am sure to be damned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you endeavour to mend?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes; and fled from not only my sins, but sinful company
too;

<P>and betook me to religious duties, as prayer, reading, weeping for sin,

<P>speaking truth to my neighbours, &amp;c.&nbsp; These things did I,

<P>with many others, too much here to relate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you think yourself well then?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Then he thought himself well>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes, for a while; but at the last, my trouble came tumbling

<P>upon me again, and that over the neck of all my reformations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{344}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; How came that about, since you were now reformed?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;Reformation at last could not help, and why>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; There were several things brought it upon me,

<P>especially such sayings as these:&nbsp; "All our righteousnesses

<P>are as filthy rags."&nbsp; [Isa. 64:6]&nbsp; "By the works of the law

<P>shall no flesh be justified."&nbsp; [Gal. 2:16]&nbsp; "When ye shall
have done

<P>all those things, say, We are unprofitable", [Luke 17:10] with many
more

<P>such like.&nbsp; From whence I began to reason with myself thus:

<P>If ALL my righteousnesses are filthy rags; if, by the deeds of the law,

<P>NO man can be justified; and if, when we have done ALL,

<P>we are yet unprofitable, then it is but a folly to think of heaven

<P>by the law.&nbsp; &lt;His being a debtor by the law troubled him>

<P>I further thought thus:&nbsp; If a man runs a hundred pounds

<P>into the shopkeeper's debt, and after that shall pay for all that he

<P>shall fetch; yet, if this old debt stands still in the book uncrossed,

<P>for that the shopkeeper may sue him, and cast him into prison

<P>till he shall pay the debt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, and how did you apply this to yourself?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why; I thought thus with myself.&nbsp; I have, by my sins,

<P>run a great way into God's book, and that my now reforming

<P>will not pay off that score; therefore I should think still,

<P>under all my present amendments, But how shall I be freed from

<P>that damnation that I have brought myself in danger of by

<P>my former transgressions?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{345}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; A very good application:&nbsp; but, pray, go on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;His espying bad things in his best duties troubled him>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Another thing that hath troubled me, even since

<P>my late amendments, is, that if I look narrowly into the best

<P>of what I do now, I still see sin, new sin, mixing itself

<P>with the best of that I do; so that now I am forced to conclude,

<P>that notwithstanding my former fond conceits of myself and duties,

<P>I have committed sin enough in one duty to send me to hell,

<P>though my former life had been faultless.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what did you do then?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{346}

<P>&lt;This made him break his mind to Faithful, who told him the way

<P>to be saved>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Do! I could not tell what to do, until I brake my mind

<P>to Faithful, for he and I were well acquainted.&nbsp; And he told me,

<P>that unless I could obtain the righteousness of a man that never

<P>had sinned, neither mine own, nor all the righteousness of the world

<P>could save me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you think he spake true?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Had he told me so when I was pleased and satisfied

<P>with mine own amendment, I had called him fool for his pains;

<P>but now, since I see mine own infirmity, and the sin that cleaves

<P>to my best performance, I have been forced to be of his opinion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{347}

<P>CHR.&nbsp; But did you think, when at first he suggested it to you,

<P>that there was such a man to be found, of whom it might justly be said

<P>that he never committed sin?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;At which he started at present>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I must confess the words at first sounded strangely,

<P>but after a little more talk and company with him,

<P>I had full conviction about it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you ask him what man this was, and how you must

<P>be justified by him?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;A more particular discovery of the way to be saved>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes, and he told me it was the Lord Jesus, that dwelleth
on

<P>the right hand of the Most High.&nbsp; And thus, said he, you must

<P>be justified by him, even by trusting to what he hath done by himself,

<P>in the days of his flesh, and suffered when he did hang on the tree.

<P>I asked him further, how that man's righteousness could be

<P>of that efficacy to justify another before God?&nbsp; And he told me

<P>he was the mighty God, and did what he did, and died the death also,

<P>not for himself, but for me; to whom his doings, and the worthiness

<P>of them, should be imputed, if I believed on him.&nbsp; [Heb. 10, Rom.
6,

<P>&lt;He doubts of acceptation>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I made my objections against my believing, for that I thought

<P>he was not willing to save me.

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;He is better instructed>

<P>HOPE.&nbsp; He bid me go to him and see.&nbsp; Then I said it was presumption;

<P>but he said, No, for I was invited to come.&nbsp; [Matt. 11:28]

<P>Then he gave me a book of Jesus, his inditing, to encourage me

<P>the more freely to come; and he said, concerning that book,

<P>that every jot and tittle thereof stood firmer than heaven and earth.

<P>[Matt. 24:35]&nbsp; Then I asked him, What I must do when I came; and
he

<P>told me, I must entreat upon my knees, with all my heart and soul,

<P>the Father to reveal him to me.&nbsp; [Ps. 95:6, Dan. 6:10, Jer. 29:12,13]

<P>Then I asked him further, how I must make my supplication to him?

<P>And he said, Go, and thou shalt find him upon a mercy-seat,

<P>where he sits all the year long, to give pardon and forgiveness

<P>to them that come.&nbsp; I told him that I knew not what to say when
I came.

<P>&lt;He is bid to pray>&nbsp; And he bid me say to this effect:

<P>God be merciful to me a sinner, and make me to know and believe

<P>in Jesus Christ; for I see, that if his righteousness had not been,

<P>or I have not faith in that righteousness, I am utterly cast away.

<P>Lord, I have heard that thou art a merciful God, and hast ordained

<P>that thy Son Jesus Christ should be the Saviour of the world;

<P>and moreover, that thou art willing to bestow him upon

<P>such a poor sinner as I am, (and I am a sinner indeed); Lord,

<P>take therefore this opportunity and magnify thy grace

<P>in the salvation of my soul, through thy Son Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.
