for his Book</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{1}

<P>When at the first I took my pen in hand

<P>Thus for to write, I did not understand

<P>That I at all should make a little book

<P>In such a mode; nay, I had undertook

<P>To make another; which, when almost done,

<P>Before I was aware, I this begun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And thus it was:&nbsp; I, writing of the way

<P>And race of saints, in this our gospel day,

<P>Fell suddenly into an allegory

<P>About their journey, and the way to glory,

<P>In more than twenty things which I set down.

<P>This done, I twenty more had in my crown;

<P>And they again began to multiply,

<P>Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nay, then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,

<P>I'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last

<P>Should prove ad infinitum, and eat out

<P>The book that I already am about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, so I did; but yet I did not think

<P>To shew to all the world my pen and ink

<P>In such a mode; I only thought to make

<P>I knew not what; nor did I undertake

<P>Thereby to please my neighbour:&nbsp; no, not I;

<P>I did it my own self to gratify.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{2}

<P>Neither did I but vacant seasons spend

<P>In this my scribble; nor did I intend

<P>But to divert myself in doing this

<P>From worser thoughts which make me do amiss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus, I set pen to paper with delight,

<P>And quickly had my thoughts in black and white.

<P>For, having now my method by the end,

<P>Still as I pulled, it came; and so I penned

<P>It down:&nbsp; until it came at last to be,

<P>For length and breadth, the bigness which you see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, when I had thus put mine ends together,

<P>I shewed them others, that I might see whether

<P>They would condemn them, or them justify:

<P>And some said, Let them live; some, Let them die;

<P>Some said, JOHN, print it; others said, Not so;

<P>Some said, It might do good; others said, No.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now was I in a strait, and did not see

<P>Which was the best thing to be done by me:

<P>At last I thought, Since you are thus divided,

<P>I print it will, and so the case decided.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{3}

<P>For, thought I, some, I see, would have it done,

<P>Though others in that channel do not run:

<P>To prove, then, who advised for the best,

<P>Thus I thought fit to put it to the test.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I further thought, if now I did deny

<P>Those that would have it, thus to gratify.

<P>I did not know but hinder them I might

<P>Of that which would to them be great delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For those which were not for its coming forth,

<P>I said to them, Offend you I am loth,

<P>Yet, since your brethren pleased with it be,

<P>Forbear to judge till you do further see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If that thou wilt not read, let it alone;

<P>Some love the meat, some love to pick the bone.

<P>Yea, that I might them better palliate,

<P>I did too with them thus expostulate:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{4}

<P>May I not write in such a style as this?

<P>In such a method, too, and yet not miss

<P>My end--thy good?&nbsp; Why may it not be done?

<P>Dark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring none.

<P>Yea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops

<P>Cause to descend, the earth, by yielding crops,

<P>Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,

<P>But treasures up the fruit they yield together;

<P>Yea, so commixes both, that in her fruit

<P>None can distinguish this from that:&nbsp; they suit

<P>Her well when hungry; but, if she be full,

<P>She spews out both, and makes their blessings null.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>You see the ways the fisherman doth take

<P>To catch the fish; what engines doth he make?

<P>Behold how he engageth all his wits;

<P>Also his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and nets;

<P>Yet fish there be, that neither hook, nor line,

<P>Nor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine:

<P>They must be groped for, and be tickled too,

<P>Or they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How does the fowler seek to catch his game

<P>By divers means! all which one cannot name:

<P>His guns, his nets, his lime-twigs, light, and bell:

<P>He creeps, he goes, he stands; yea, who can tell

<P>Of all his postures?&nbsp; Yet there's none of these

<P>Will make him master of what fowls he please.

<P>Yea, he must pipe and whistle to catch this,

<P>Yet, if he does so, that bird he will miss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If that a pearl may in a toad's head dwell,

<P>And may be found too in an oyster-shell;

<P>If things that promise nothing do contain

<P>What better is than gold; who will disdain,

<P>That have an inkling of it, there to look,

<P>That they may find it?&nbsp; Now, my little book,

<P>(Though void of all these paintings that may make

<P>It with this or the other man to take)

<P>Is not without those things that do excel

<P>What do in brave but empty notions dwell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{5}

<P>`Well, yet I am not fully satisfied,

<P>That this your book will stand, when soundly tried.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Why, what's the matter?&nbsp; `It is dark.'&nbsp; What though?

<P>`But it is feigned.'&nbsp; What of that?&nbsp; I trow?

<P>Some men, by feigned words, as dark as mine,

<P>Make truth to spangle and its rays to shine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>`But they want solidness.'&nbsp; Speak, man, thy mind.

<P>`They drown the weak; metaphors make us blind.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Solidity, indeed, becomes the pen

<P>Of him that writeth things divine to men;

<P>But must I needs want solidness, because

<P>By metaphors I speak?&nbsp; Were not God's laws,

<P>His gospel laws, in olden times held forth

<P>By types, shadows, and metaphors?&nbsp; Yet loth

<P>Will any sober man be to find fault

<P>With them, lest he be found for to assault

<P>The highest wisdom.&nbsp; No, he rather stoops,

<P>And seeks to find out what by pins and loops,

<P>By calves and sheep, by heifers and by rams,

<P>By birds and herbs, and by the blood of lambs,

<P>God speaketh to him; and happy is he

<P>That finds the light and grace that in them be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{6}

<P>Be not too forward, therefore, to conclude

<P>That I want solidness--that I am rude;

<P>All things solid in show not solid be;

<P>All things in parables despise not we;

<P>Lest things most hurtful lightly we receive,

<P>And things that good are, of our souls bereave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My dark and cloudy words, they do but hold

<P>The truth, as cabinets enclose the gold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The prophets used much by metaphors

<P>To set forth truth; yea, who so considers

<P>Christ, his apostles too, shall plainly see,

<P>That truths to this day in such mantles be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Am I afraid to say, that holy writ,

<P>Which for its style and phrase puts down all wit,

<P>Is everywhere so full of all these things--

<P>Dark figures, allegories?&nbsp; Yet there springs

<P>From that same book that lustre, and those rays

<P>Of light, that turn our darkest nights to days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{7}

<P>Come, let my carper to his life now look,

<P>And find there darker lines than in my book

<P>He findeth any; yea, and let him know,

<P>That in his best things there are worse lines too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>May we but stand before impartial men,

<P>To his poor one I dare adventure ten,

<P>That they will take my meaning in these lines

<P>Far better than his lies in silver shrines.

<P>Come, truth, although in swaddling clouts, I find,

<P>Informs the judgement, rectifies the mind;

<P>Pleases the understanding, makes the will

<P>Submit; the memory too it doth fill

<P>With what doth our imaginations please;

<P>Likewise it tends our troubles to appease.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sound words, I know, Timothy is to use,

<P>And old wives' fables he is to refuse;

<P>But yet grave Paul him nowhere did forbid

<P>The use of parables; in which lay hid

<P>That gold, those pearls, and precious stones that were

<P>Worth digging for, and that with greatest care.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Let me add one word more.&nbsp; O man of God,

<P>Art thou offended?&nbsp; Dost thou wish I had

<P>Put forth my matter in another dress?

<P>Or, that I had in things been more express?

<P>Three things let me propound; then I submit

<P>To those that are my betters, as is fit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{8}

<P>1.&nbsp; I find not that I am denied the use

<P>Of this my method, so I no abuse

<P>Put on the words, things, readers; or be rude

<P>In handling figure or similitude,

<P>In application; but, all that I may,

<P>Seek the advance of truth this or that way

<P>Denied, did I say?&nbsp; Nay, I have leave

<P>(Example too, and that from them that have

<P>God better pleased, by their words or ways,

<P>Than any man that breatheth now-a-days)

<P>Thus to express my mind, thus to declare

<P>Things unto thee that excellentest are.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>2.&nbsp; I find that men (as high as trees) will write

<P>Dialogue-wise; yet no man doth them slight

<P>For writing so:&nbsp; indeed, if they abuse

<P>Truth, cursed be they, and the craft they use

<P>To that intent; but yet let truth be free

<P>To make her sallies upon thee and me,

<P>Which way it pleases God; for who knows how,

<P>Better than he that taught us first to plough,

<P>To guide our mind and pens for his design?

<P>And he makes base things usher in divine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3.&nbsp; I find that holy writ in many places

<P>Hath semblance with this method, where the cases

<P>Do call for one thing, to set forth another;

<P>Use it I may, then, and yet nothing smother

<P>Truth's golden beams:&nbsp; nay, by this method may

<P>Make it cast forth its rays as light as day.

<P>And now before I do put up my pen,

<P>I'll shew the profit of my book, and then

<P>Commit both thee and it unto that Hand

<P>That pulls the strong down, and makes weak ones stand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This book it chalketh out before thine eyes

<P>The man that seeks the everlasting prize;

<P>It shews you whence he comes, whither he goes;

<P>What he leaves undone, also what he does;

<P>It also shows you how he runs and runs,

<P>Till he unto the gate of glory comes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{9}

<P>It shows, too, who set out for life amain,

<P>As if the lasting crown they would obtain;

<P>Here also you may see the reason why

<P>They lose their labour, and like fools do die.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This book will make a traveller of thee,

<P>If by its counsel thou wilt ruled be;

<P>It will direct thee to the Holy Land,

<P>If thou wilt its directions understand:

<P>Yea, it will make the slothful active be;

<P>The blind also delightful things to see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Art thou for something rare and profitable?

<P>Wouldest thou see a truth within a fable?

<P>Art thou forgetful?&nbsp; Wouldest thou remember

<P>From New-Year's day to the last of December?

<P>Then read my fancies; they will stick like burs,

<P>And may be, to the helpless, comforters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This book is writ in such a dialect

<P>As may the minds of listless men affect:

<P>It seems a novelty, and yet contains

<P>Nothing but sound and honest gospel strains.

<P>Wouldst thou divert thyself from melancholy?

<P>Wouldst thou be pleasant, yet be far from folly?

<P>Wouldst thou read riddles, and their explanation?

<P>Or else be drowned in thy contemplation?

<P>Dost thou love picking meat?&nbsp; Or wouldst thou see

<P>A man in the clouds, and hear him speak to thee?

<P>Wouldst thou be in a dream, and yet not sleep?

<P>Or wouldst thou in a moment laugh and weep?

<P>Wouldest thou lose thyself and catch no harm,

<P>And find thyself again without a charm?

<P>Wouldst read thyself, and read thou knowest not what,

<P>And yet know whether thou art blest or not,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By reading the same lines?&nbsp; Oh, then come hither,

<P>And lay my book, thy head, and heart together.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
JOHN BUNYAN.
