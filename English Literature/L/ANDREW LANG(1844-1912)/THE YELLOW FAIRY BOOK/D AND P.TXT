 Books Yellow, Red, and Green and Blue,

 All true, or just as good as true,

 Hard is the path from A to Z,

 And puzzling to a curly head,

 Yet leads to Books--Green, Blue, and Red.



 For every child should understand

 That letters from the first were planned

 To guide us into Fairy Land



 So labour at your Alphabet,

 For by that learning shall you get

 To lands where Fairies may be met.



 And going where this pathway goes,

 You too, at last, may find, who knows?

 The Garden of the Singing Rose.







PREFACE



The Editor thinks that children will readily forgive him for

publishing another Fairy Book.  We have had the Blue, the Red,

the Green, and here is the Yellow.  If children are pleased, and

they are so kind as to say that they are pleased, the Editor does

not care very much for what other people may say.  Now, there is

one gentleman who seems to think that it is not quite right to

print so many fairy tales, with pictures, and to publish them in

red and blue covers.  He is named Mr. G. Laurence Gomme, and he

is president of a learned body called the Folk Lore Society. 

Once a year he makes his address to his subjects, of whom the

Editor is one, and Mr. Joseph Jacobs (who has published many

delightful fairy tales with pretty pictures)[1] is another. 

Fancy, then, the dismay of Mr. Jacobs, and of the Editor, when

they heard their president say that he did not think it very nice

in them to publish fairy books, above all, red, green, and blue

fairy books!   They said that they did not see any harm in it,

and they were ready to 'put themselves on their country,' and be

tried by a jury of children.  And, indeed, they still see no harm

in what they have done; nay, like Father William in the poem,

they are ready 'to do it again and again.'





[1] You may buy them from Mr. Nutt, in the Strand.





Where is the harm? The truth is that the Folk Lore Society--made

up of the most clever, learned, and beautiful men and women of

the country--is fond of studying the history and geography of

Fairy Land.  This is contained in very old tales, such as country

people tell, and savages:



     'Little Sioux and little Crow,

      Little frosty Eskimo.'





These people are thought to know most about fairyland and its

inhabitants.  But, in the Yellow Fairy Book, and the rest, are

many tales by persons who are neither savages nor rustics, such

as Madame D'Aulnoy and Herr Hans Christian Andersen.  The Folk

Lore Society, or its president, say that THEIR tales are not so

true as the rest, and should not be published with the rest.  But

WE say that all the stories which are pleasant to read are quite

true enough for us; so here they are, with pictures by Mr. Ford,

and we do not think that either the pictures or the stories are

likely to mislead children.



As to whether there are really any fairies or not, that is a

difficult question.  Professor Huxley thinks there are none.  The

Editor never saw any himself, but he knows several people who

have seen them--in the Highlands--and heard their music.  If ever

you are in Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may

hearthe music yourself, as grown-up people have done, but you

must goon a fine day.  Again, if there are really no fairies, why

dopeople believe in them, all over the world?  The ancient Greeks

believed, so did the old Egyptians, and the Hindoos, and the Red

Indians, and is it likely, if there are no fairies, that so many

different peoples would have seen and heard them?  The Rev. Mr.

Baring-Gould saw several fairies when he was a boy, and was

travelling in the land of the Troubadours.  For these reasons,

the Editor thinks that there are certainly fairies, but they

never do anyone any harm; and, in England, they have been

frightened away by smoke and schoolmasters.  As to Giants, they

have died out, but real Dwarfs are common in the forests of

Africa.  Probably a good many stories not perfectly true have

been told about fairies, but such stories have also been told

about Napoleon, Claverhouse, Julius Caesar, and Joan of Arc, all

of whom certainly existed.  A wise child will, therefore,

remember that, if he grows up and becomes a member of the Folk

Lore Society, ALL the tales in this book were not offered to him

as absolutely truthful, but were printed merely for his

entertainment.  The exact facts he can learn later, or he can

leave them alone.





There are Russian, German, French, Icelandic, Red Indian, and

other stories here.  They were translated by Miss Cheape, Miss

Alma, and Miss Thyra Alleyne, Miss Sellar, Mr. Craigie (he did

the Icelandic tales), Miss Blackley, Mrs. Dent, and Mrs. Lang,

but the Red Indian stories are copied from English versions

published by the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology, in America. 

Mr. Ford did the pictures, and it is hoped that children will

find the book not less pleasing than those which have already

been submitted to their consideration.  The Editor cannot say

'good-bye' without advising them, as they pursue their studies,

to read The Rose and the Ring, by the late Mr. Thackeray, with

pictures by the author.  This book he thinks quite indispensable

in every child's library, and parents should be urged to purchase

it at the first opportunity, as without it no education is

complete.
