  WHEN A MAN JOURNEYS into a far country, he must be prepared to

forget many of the things he has learned, and to acquire such

customs as are inherent with existence in the new land; he must

abandon the old ideals and the old gods, and oftentimes he must

reverse the very codes by which his conduct has hitherto been

shaped. To those who have the protean faculty of adaptability, the

novelty of such change may even be a source of pleasure; but to

those who happen to be hardened to the ruts in which they were

created, the pressure of the altered environment is unbearable, and

they chafe in body and in spirit under the new restrictions which they

do not understand. This chafing is bound to act and react, producing

divers evils and leading to various misfortunes. It were better for

the man who cannot fit himself to the new groove to return to his

own country; if he delay too long, he will surely die.

  The man who turns his back upon the comforts of an elder

civilization, to face the savage youth, the primordial simplicity of

the North, may estimate success at an inverse ratio to the quantity

and quality of his hopelessly fixed habits. He will soon discover,

if he be a fit candidate, that the material habits are the less

important. The exchange of such things as a dainty menu for rough

fare, of the stiff leather shoe for the soft, shapeless moccasin, of

the feather bed for a couch in the snow, is after all a very easy

matter. But his pinch will come in learning properly to shape his

mind's attitude toward all things, and especially toward his fellow

man. For the courtesies of ordinary life, he must substitute

unselfishness, forbearance, and tolerance. Thus, and thus only, can he

gain that pearl of great price- true comradeship. He must not say

'thank you'; he must mean it without opening his mouth, and prove it

by responding in kind. In short, he must substitute the deed for the

word, the spirit for the letter.

  When the world rang with the tale of Arctic gold, and the lure of

the North gripped the heartstrings of men, Carter Weatherbee threw

up his snug clerkship, turned the half of his savings over to his

wife, and with the remainder bought an outfit. There was no romance in

his nature- the bondage of commerce had crushed all that; he was

simply tired of the ceaseless grind, and wished to risk great

hazards in view of corresponding returns. Like many another fool,

disdaining the old trails used by the Northland pioneers for a score

of years, he hurried to Edmonton in the spring of the year; and there,

unluckily for his soul's welfare, he allied himself with a party of

men.

  There was nothing unusual about this party, except its plans. Even

its goal, like that of all the other parties, was the Klondike. But

the route it had mapped out to attain that goal took away the breath

of the hardiest native, born and bred to the vicissitudes of the

Northwest. Even Jacques Baptiste, born of a Chippewa woman and a

renegade voyageur (having raised his first whimpers in a deerskin

lodge north of the sixty-fifth parallel, and had the same hushed by

blissful sucks of raw tallow), was surprised. Though he sold his

services to them and agreed to travel even to the never-opening ice,

he shook his head ominously whenever his advice was asked.

  Percy Cuthfert's evil star must have been in the ascendant, for

he, too, joined this company of argonauts. He was an ordinary man,

with a bank account as deep as his culture, which is saying a good

deal. He had no reason to embark on such a venture- no reason in the

world save that he suffered from an abnormal development of

sentimentality. He mistook this for the true spirit of romance and

adventure. Many another man has done the like, and made as fatal a

mistake.

  The first break-up of spring found the party following the ice-run

of Elk River. It was an imposing fleet, for the outfit was large,

and they were accompanied by a disreputable contingent of half-breed

voyageurs with their women and children. Day in and day out, they

labored with the bateaux and canoes, fought mosquitoes and other

kindred pests, or sweated and swore at the portages. Severe toil

like this lays a man naked to the very roots of his soul, and ere Lake

Athabasca was lost in the south, each member of the party had

hoisted his true colors.

  The two shirks and chronic grumblers were Carter Weatherbee and

Percy Cuthfert. The whole party complained less of its aches and pains

than did either of them. Not once did they volunteer for the

thousand and one petty duties of the camp. A bucket of water to be

brought, an extra armful of wood to be chopped, the dishes to be

washed and wiped, a search to be made through the outfit for some

suddenly indispensable article- and these two effete scions of

civilization discovered sprains or blisters requiring instant

attention. They were the first to turn in at night, with score of

tasks yet undone; the last to turn out in the morning, when the

start should be in readiness before the breakfast was begun. They were

the first to fall to at mealtime, the last to have a hand in the

cooking; the first to dive for a slim delicacy, the last to discover

they had added to their own another man's share. If they toiled at the

oars, they slyly cut the water at each stroke and allowed the boat's

momentum to float up the blade. They thought nobody noticed; but their

comrades swore under their breaths and grew to hate them, while

Jacques Baptiste sneered openly and damned them from morning till

night. But Jacques Baptiste was no gentleman.

  At the Great Slave, Hudson Bay dogs were purchased, and the fleet

sank to the guards with its added burden of dried fish and pemican.

Then canoe and bateau answered to the swift current of the

Mackenzie, and they plunged into the Great Barren Ground. Every

likely-looking 'feeder' was prospected, but the elusive 'pay-dirt'

danced ever to the north. At the Great Bear, overcome by the common

dread of the Unknown Lands, their voyageurs began to desert, and

Fort of Good Hope saw the last and bravest bending to the towlines

as they bucked the current down which they had so treacherously

glided. Jacques Baptiste alone remained. Had he not sworn to travel

even to the never-opening ice?

  The lying charts, compiled in main from hearsay, were now constantly

consulted. And they felt the need of hurry, for the sun had already

passed its northern solstice and was leading the winter south again.

Skirting the shores of the bay, where the Mackenzie disembogues into

the Arctic Ocean, they entered the mouth of the Little Peel River.

Then began the arduous up-stream toil, and the two Incapables fared

worse than ever. Towline and pole, paddle and tumpline, rapids and

portages- such tortures served to give the one a deep disgust for

great hazards, and printed for the other a fiery text on the true

romance of adventure. One day they waxed mutinous, and being vilely

cursed by Jacques Baptiste, turned, as worms sometimes will. But the

half-breed thrashed the twain, and sent them, bruised and bleeding,

about their work. It was the first time either had been manhandled.

  Abandoning their river craft at the headwaters of the Little Peel,

they consumed the rest of the summer in the great portage over the

Mackenzie watershed to the West Rat. This little stream fed the

Porcupine, which in turn joined the Yukon where that mighty highway of

the North countermarches on the Arctic Circle. But they had lost in

the race with winter, and one day they tied their rafts to the thick

eddy-ice and hurried their goods ashore. That night the river jammed

and broke several times; the following morning it had fallen asleep

for good.



  'We can't be more'n four hundred miles from the Yukon,' concluded

Sloper, multiplying his thumb nails by the scale of the map. The

council, in which the two Incapables had whined to excellent

disadvantage, was drawing to a close.

  'Hudson Bay Post, long time ago. No use um now.' Jacques

Baptiste's father had made the trip for the Fur Company in the old

days, incidentally marking the trail with a couple of frozen toes.

  Sufferin' cracky!' cried another of the party. 'No whites?'

  'Nary white,' Sloper sententiously affirmed; 'but it's only five

hundred more up the Yukon to Dawson. Call it a rough thousand from

here.'

  Weatherbee and Cuthfert groaned in chorus.

  'How long'll that take, Baptiste?'

  The half-breed figured for a moment. 'Workum like hell, no man

play out, ten- twenty- forty- fifty days. Um babies come' (designating

the Incapables), 'no can tell. Mebbe when hell freeze over; mebbe

not then.'

  The manufacture of snowshoes and moccasins ceased. Somebody called

the name of an absent member, who came out of an ancient cabin at

the edge of the campfire and joined them. The cabin was one of the

many mysteries which lurk in the vast recesses of the North. Built

when and by whom, no man could tell. Two graves in the open, piled

high with stones, perhaps contained the secret of those early

wanderers. But whose hand had piled the stones?

  The moment had come. Jacques Baptiste paused in the fitting of a

harness and pinned the struggling dog in the snow. The cook made

mute protest for delay, threw a handful of bacon into a noisy pot of

beans, then came to attention. Sloper rose to his feet. His body was a

ludicrous contrast to the healthy physiques of the Incapables.

Yellow and weak, fleeing from a South American fever-hole, he had

not broken his flight across the zones, and was still able to toil

with men. His weight was probably ninety pounds, with the heavy

hunting knife thrown in, and his grizzled hair told of a prime which

had ceased to be. The fresh young muscles of either Weatherbee or

Cuthfert were equal to ten times the endeavor of his; yet he could

walk them into the earth in a day's journey. And all this day he had

whipped his stronger comrades into venturing a thousand miles of the

stiffest hardship man can conceive. He was the incarnation of the

unrest of his race, and the old Teutonic stubbornness, dashed with the

quick grasp and action of the Yankee, held the flesh in the bondage of

the spirit.

  'All those in favor of going on with the dogs as soon as the ice

sets, say ay.'

  'Ay!' rang out eight voices- voices destined to string a trail of

oaths along many a hundred miles of pain.

  'Contrary minded?'

  'No!' For the first time the Incapables were united without some

compromise of personal interests.

  'And what are you going to do about it?' Weatherbee added

belligerently.

  'Majority rule! Majority rule!' clamored the rest of the party.

  'I know the expedition is liable to fall through if you don't come,'

Sloper replied sweetly; 'but I guess, if we try real hard, we can

manage to do without you. What do you say, boys?'

  The sentiment was cheered to the echo.

  'But I say, you know,' Cuthfert ventured apprehensively; 'what's a

chap like me to do?'

  'Ain't you coming with us.'

  'No- o.'

  'Then do as you damn well please. We won't have nothing to say.'

  'Kind o' calkilate yuh might settle it with that canoodlin'

pardner of yourn,' suggested a heavy-going Westerner from the Dakotas,

at the same time pointing out Weatherbee. 'He'll be shore to ask yuh

what yur a-goin' to do when it comes to cookin' an' gatherin' the

wood.'

  'Then we'll consider it all arranged,' concluded Sloper. 'We'll pull

out tomorrow, if we camp within five miles- just to get everything

in running order and remember if we've forgotten anything.'



  The sleds groaned by on their steel-shod runners, and the dogs

strained low in the harnesses in which they were born to die.

Jacques Baptiste paused by the side of Sloper to get a last glimpse of

the cabin. The smoke curled up pathetically from the Yukon

stovepipe. The two Incapables were watching them from the doorway.

  Sloper laid his hand on the other's shoulder.

  'Jacques Baptiste, did you ever hear of the Kilkenny cats?'

  The half-breed shook his head.

  'Well, my friend and good comrade, the Kilkenny cats fought till

neither hide, nor hair, nor yowl, was left. You understand?- till

nothing was left. Very good. Now, these two men don't like work.

They'll be all alone in that cabin all winter- a mighty long, dark

winter. Kilkenny cats- well?'

  The Frenchman in Baptiste shrugged his shoulders, but the Indian

in him was silent. Nevertheless, it was an eloquent shrug, pregnant

with prophecy.



  Things prospered in the little cabin at first. The rough badinage of

their comrades had made Weatherbee and Cuthfert conscious of the

mutual responsibility which had devolved upon them; besides, there was

not so much work after all for two healthy men. And the removal of the

cruel whiphand, or in other words the bulldozing half-breed, had

brought with it a joyous reaction. At first, each strove to outdo

the other, and they performed petty tasks with an unction which

would have opened the eyes of their comrades who were now wearing

out bodies and souls on the Long Trail.

  All care was banished. The forest, which shouldered in upon them

from three sides, was an inexhaustible woodyard. A few yards from

their door slept the Porcupine, and a hole through its winter robe

formed a bubbling spring of water, crystal clear and painfully cold.

But they soon grew to find fault with even that. The hole would

persist in freezing up, and thus gave them many a miserable hour of

ice-chopping. The unknown builders of the cabin had extended the

sidelogs so as to support a cache at the rear. In this was stored

the bulk of the party's provisions. Food there was, without stint, for

three times the men who were fated to live upon it. But the most of it

was the kind which built up brawn and sinew, but did not tickle the

palate. True, there was sugar in plenty for two ordinary men; but

these two were little else than children. They early discovered the

virtues of hot water judiciously saturated with sugar, and they

prodigally swam their flapjacks and soaked their crusts in the rich,

white syrup. Then coffee and tea, and especially the dried fruits,

made disastrous inroads upon it. The first words they had were over

the sugar question. And it is a really serious thing when two men,

wholly dependent upon each other for company, begin to quarrel.

  Weatherbee loved to discourse blatantly on politics, while Cuthfert,

who had been prone to clip his coupons and let the commonwealth jog on

as best it might, either ignored the subject or delivered himself of

startling epigrams. But the clerk was too obtuse to appreciate the

clever shaping of thought, and this waste of ammunition irritated

Cuthfert. He had been used to blinding people by his brilliancy, and

it worked him quite a hardship, this loss of an audience. He felt

personally aggrieved and unconsciously held his muttonhead companion

responsible for it.

  Save existence, they had nothing in common- came in touch on no

single point. Weatherbee was a clerk who had known naught but clerking

all his life; Cuthfert was a master of arts, a dabbler in oils, and

had written not a little. The one was a lower-class man who considered

himself a gentleman, and the other was a gentleman who knew himself to

be such. From this it may be remarked that a man can be a gentleman

without possessing the first instinct of true comradeship. The clerk

was as sensuous as the other was aesthetic, and his love adventures,

told at great length and chiefly coined from his imagination, affected

the supersensitive master of arts in the same way as so many whiffs of

sewer gas. He deemed the clerk a filthy, uncultured brute, whose place

was in the muck with the swine, and told him so; and he was

reciprocally informed that he was a milk-and-water sissy and a cad.

Weatherbee could not have defined 'cad' for his life; but it satisfied

its purpose, which after all seems the main point in life.

  Weatherbee flatted every third note and sang such songs as 'The

Boston Burglar' and 'the Handsome Cabin Boy,' for hours at a time,

while Cuthfert wept with rage, till he could stand it no longer and

fled into the outer cold. But there was no escape. The intense frost

could not be endured for long at a time, and the little cabin

crowded them- beds, stove, table, and all- into a space of ten by

twelve. The very presence of either became a personal affront to the

other, and they lapsed into sullen silences which increased in

length and strength as the days went by. Occasionally, the flash of an

eye or the curl of a lip got the better of them, though they strove to

wholly ignore each other during these mute periods. And a great wonder

sprang up in the breast of each, as to how God had ever come to create

the other.

  With little to do, time became an intolerable burden to them. This

naturally made them still lazier. They sank into a physical lethargy

which there was no escaping, and which made them rebel at the

performance of the smallest chore. One morning when it was his turn to

cook the common breakfast, Weatherbee rolled out of his blankets,

and to the snoring of his companion, lighted first the slush-lamp

and then the fire. The kettles were frozen hard, and there was no

water in the cabin with which to wash. But he did not mind that.

Waiting for it to thaw, he sliced the bacon and plunged into the

hateful task of bread-making. Cuthfert had been slyly watching through

his half-closed lids. Consequently there was a scene, in which they

fervently blessed each other, and agreed, henceforth, that each do his

own cooking. A week later, Cuthfert neglected his morning ablutions,

but none the less complacently ate the meal which he had cooked.

Weatherbee grinned. After that the foolish custom of washing passed

out of their lives.

  As the sugar-pile and other little luxuries dwindled, they began

to be afraid they were not getting their proper shares, and in order

that they might not be robbed, they fell to gorging themselves. The

luxuries suffered in this gluttonous contest, as did also the men.

In the absence of fresh vegetables and exercise, their blood became

impoverished, and a loathsome, purplish rash crept over their

bodies. Yet they refused to heed the warning. Next, their muscles

and joints began to swell, the flesh turning black, while their

mouths, gums, and lips took on the color of rich cream. Instead of

being drawn together by their misery, each gloated over the other's

symptoms as the scurvy took its course.

  They lost all regard for personal appearance, and for that matter,

common decency. The cabin became a pigpen, and never once were the

beds made or fresh pine boughs laid underneath. Yet they could not

keep to their blankets, as they would have wished; for the frost was

inexorable, and the fire box consumed much fuel. The hair of their

heads and faces grew long and shaggy, while their garments would

have disgusted a ragpicker. But they did not care. They were sick, and

there was no one to see; besides, it was very painful to move about.

  To all this was added a new trouble- the Fear of the North. This

Fear was the joint child of the Great Cold and the Great Silence,

and was born in the darkness of December, when the sun dipped below

the horizon for good. It affected them according to their natures.

Weatherbee fell prey to the grosser superstitions, and did his best to

resurrect the spirits which slept in the forgotten graves. It was a

fascinating thing, and in his dreams they came to him from out of

the cold, and snuggled into his blankets, and told him of their

toils and troubles ere they died. He shrank away from the clammy

contact as they drew closer and twined their frozen limbs about him,

and when they whispered in his ear of things to come, the cabin rang

with his frightened shrieks. Cuthfert did not understand- for they

no longer spoke- and when thus awakened he invariably grabbed for

his revolver. Then he would sit up in bed, shivering nervously, with

the weapon trained on the unconscious dreamer. Cuthfert deemed the man

going mad, and so came to fear for his life.

  His own malady assumed a less concrete form. The mysterious

artisan who had laid the cabin, log by log, had pegged a wind-vane

to the ridgepole. Cuthfert noticed it always pointed south, and one

day, irritated by its steadfastness of purpose, he turned it toward

the east. He watched eagerly, but never a breath came by to disturb

it. Then he turned the vane to the north, swearing never again to

touch it till the wind did blow. But the air frightened him with its

unearthly calm, and he often rose in the middle of the night to see if

the vane had veered- ten degrees would have satisfied him. But no,

it poised above him as unchangeable as fate. His imagination ran riot,

till it became to him a fetish. Sometimes he followed the path it

pointed across the dismal dominions, and allowed his soul to become

saturated with the Fear. He dwelt upon the unseen and the unknown till

the burden of eternity appeared to be crushing him. Everything in

the Northland had that crushing effect- the absence of life and

motion; the darkness; the infinite peace of the brooding land; the

ghastly silence, which made the echo of each heartbeat a sacrilege;

the solemn forest which seemed to guard an awful, inexpressible

something, which neither word nor thought could compass.

  The world he had so recently left, with its busy nations and great

enterprises, seemed very far away. Recollections occasionally

obtruded- recollections of marts and galleries and crowded

thoroughfares, of evening dress and social functions, of good men

and dear women he had known- but they were dim memories of a life he

had lived long centuries agone, on some other planet. This phantasm

was the Reality. Standing beneath the wind-vane, his eyes fixed on the

polar skies, he could not bring himself to realize that the

Southland really existed, that at that very moment it was a-roar

with life and action. There was no Southland, no men being born of

women, no giving and taking in marriage. Beyond his bleak skyline

there stretched vast solitudes, and beyond these still vaster

solitudes. There were no lands of sunshine, heavy with the perfume

of flowers. Such things were only old dreams of paradise. The sunlands

of the West and the spicelands of the East, the smiling Arcadias and

blissful Islands of the Blest- ha! ha! His laughter split the void and

shocked him with its unwonted sound. There was no sun. This was the

Universe, dead and cold and dark, and he its only citizen. Weatherbee?

At such moments Weatherbee did not count. He was a Caliban, a

monstrous phantom, fettered to him for untold ages, the penalty of

some forgotten crime.

  He lived with Death among the dead, emasculated by the sense of

his own insignificance, crushed by the passive mastery of the

slumbering ages. The magnitude of all things appalled him.

Everything partook of the superlative save himself- the perfect

cessation of wind and motion, the immensity of the snow-covered

wildness, the height of the sky and the depth of the silence. That

wind-vane- if it would only move. If a thunderbolt would fall, or

the forest flare up in flame. The rolling up of the heavens as a

scroll, the crash of Doom- anything, anything! But no, nothing

moved; the Silence crowded in, and the Fear of the North laid icy

fingers on his heart.

  Once, like another Crusoe, by the edge of the river he came upon a

track- the faint tracery of a snowshoe rabbit on the delicate

snow-crust. It was a revelation. There was life in the Northland. He

would follow it, look upon it, gloat over it. He forgot his swollen

muscles, plunging through the deep snow in an ecstasy of anticipation.

The forest swallowed him up, and the brief midday twilight vanished;

but he pursued his quest till exhausted nature asserted itself and

laid him helpless in the snow. There he groaned and cursed his

folly, and knew the track to be the fancy of his brain; and late

that night he dragged himself into the cabin on hands and knees, his

cheeks frozen and a strange numbness about his feet. Weatherbee

grinned malevolently, but made no offer to help him. He thrust needles

into his toes and thawed them out by the stove. A week later

mortification set in.

  But the clerk had his own troubles. The dead men came out of their

graves more frequently now, and rarely left him, waking or sleeping.

He grew to wait and dread their coming, never passing the twin

cairns without a shudder. One night they came to him in his sleep

and led him forth to an appointed task. Frightened into inarticulate

horror, he awoke between the heaps of stones and fled wildly to the

cabin. But he had lain there for some time, for his feet and cheeks

were also frozen.

  Sometimes he became frantic at their insistent presence, and

danced about the cabin, cutting the empty air with an axe, and

smashing everything within reach. During these ghostly encounters,

Cuthfert huddled into his blankets and followed the madman about

with a cocked revolver, ready to shoot him if he came too near. But,

recovering from one of these spells, the clerk noticed the weapon

trained upon him. His suspicions were aroused, and thenceforth he,

too, lived in fear of his life. They watched each other closely

after that, and faced about in startled fright whenever either

passed behind the other's back. The apprehensiveness became a mania

which controlled them even in their sleep. Through mutual fear they

tacitly let the slush-lamp burn all night, and saw to a plentiful

supply of bacon-grease before retiring. The slightest movement on

the part of one was sufficient to arouse the other, and many a still

watch their gazes countered as they shook beneath their blankets

with fingers on the trigger-guards.

  What with the Fear of the North, the mental strain, and the

ravages of the disease, they lost all semblance of humanity, taking on

the appearance of wild beasts, hunted and desperate. Their cheeks

and noses, as an aftermath of the freezing, had turned black. Their

frozen toes had begun to drop away at the first and second joints.

Every movement brought pain, but the fire box was insatiable, wringing

a ransom of torture from their miserable bodies. Day in, day out, it

demanded its food- a veritable pound of flesh- and they dragged

themselves into the forest to chop wood on their knees. Once, crawling

thus in search of dry sticks, unknown to each other they entered a

thicket from opposite sides. Suddenly, without warning, two peering

death's-heads confronted each other. Suffering had so transformed them

that recognition was impossible. They sprang to their feet,

shrieking with terror, and dashed away on their mangled stumps; and

falling at the cabin's door, they clawed and scratched like demons

till they discovered their mistake.



  Occasionally they lapsed normal, and during one of these sane

intervals, the chief bone of contention, the sugar, had been divided

equally between them. They guarded their separate sacks, stored up

in the cache, with jealous eyes; for there were but a few cupfuls

left, and they were totally devoid of faith in each other. But one day

Cuthfert made a mistake. Hardly able to move, sick with pain, with his

head swimming and eyes blinded, he crept into the cache, sugar

canister in hand, and mistook Weatherbee's sack for his own.

  January had been born but a few days when this occurred. The sun had

some time since passed its lowest southern declination, and at

meridian now threw flaunting streaks of yellow light upon the northern

sky. On the day following his mistake with the sugarbag, Cuthfert

found himself feeling better, both in body and in spirit. As

noontime drew near and the day brightened, he dragged himself

outside to feast on the evanescent glow, which was to him an earnest

of the sun's future intentions. Weatherbee was also feeling somewhat

better, and crawled out beside him. They propped themselves in the

snow beneath the moveless wind-vane, and waited.

  The stillness of death was about them. In other climes, when

nature falls into such moods, there is a subdued air of expectancy,

a waiting for some small voice to take up the broken strain. Not so in

the North. The two men had lived seeming eons in this ghostly peace.

They could remember no song of the past; they could conjure no song of

the future. This unearthly calm had always been- the tranquil

silence of eternity.

  Their eyes were fixed upon the north. Unseen, behind their backs,

behind the towering mountains to the south, the sun swept toward the

zenith of another sky than theirs. Sole spectators of the mighty

canvas, they watched the false dawn slowly grow. A faint flame began

to glow and smoulder. It deepened in intensity, ringing the changes of

reddish-yellow, purple, and saffron. So bright did it become that

Cuthfert thought the sun must surely be behind it- a miracle, the

sun rising in the north! Suddenly, without warning and without fading,

the canvas was swept clean. There was no color in the sky. The light

had gone out of the day. They caught their breaths in half-sobs. But

lo! the air was aglint with particles of scintillating frost, and

there, to the north, the wind-vane lay in vague outline of the snow. A

shadow! A shadow! It was exactly midday. They jerked their heads

hurriedly to the south. A golden rim peeped over the mountain's

snowy shoulder, smiled upon them an instant, then dipped from sight

again.

  There were tears in their eyes as they sought each other. A

strange softening came over them. They felt irresistibly drawn

toward each other. The sun was coming back again. It would be with

them tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And it would stay

longer every visit, and a time would come when it would ride their

heaven day and night, never once dropping below the skyline. There

would be no night. The ice-locked winter would be broken; the winds

would blow and the forests answer; the land would bathe in the blessed

sunshine, and life renew. Hand in hand, they would quit this horrid

dream and journey back to the Southland. They lurched blindly forward,

and their hands met- their poor maimed hands, swollen and distorted

beneath their mittens.

  But the promise was destined to remain unfulfilled. The Northland is

the Northland, and men work out their souls by strange rules, which

other men, who have not journeyed into far countries, cannot come to

understand.



  An hour later, Cuthfert put a pan of bread into the oven, and fell

to speculating on what the surgeons could do with his feet when he got

back. Home did not seem so very far away now. Weatherbee was rummaging

in the cache. Of a sudden, he raised a whirlwind of blasphemy, which

in turn ceased with startling abruptness. The other man had robbed his

sugar-sack. Still, things might have happened differently, had not the

two dead men come out from under the stones and hushed the hot words

in his throat. They led him quite gently from the cache, which he

forgot to close. That consummation was reached; that something they

had whispered to him in his dreams was about to happen. They guided

him gently, very gently, to the woodpile, where they put the axe in

his hands. Then they helped him shove open the cabin door, and he felt

sure they shut it after him- at least he heard it slam and the latch

fall sharply into place. And he knew they were waiting just without,

waiting for him to do his task.

  'Carter! I say, Carter!'

  Percy Cuthfert was frightened at the look on the clerk's face, and

he made haste to put the table between them.

  Carter Weatherbee followed, without haste and without enthusiasm.

There was neither pity nor passion in his face, but rather the

patient, stolid look of one who has certain work to do and goes


about it methodically.

  'I say, what's the matter?'

  The clerk dodged back, cutting off his retreat to the door, but

never opening his mouth.

  'I say, Carter, I say; let's talk. There's a good chap.'

  The master of arts was thinking rapidly, now, shaping a skillful

flank movement on the bed where his Smith & Wesson lay. Keeping his

eyes on the madman, he rolled backward on the bunk, at the same time

clutching the pistol.

  'Carter!'

  The powder flashed full in Weatherbee's face, but he swung his

weapon and leaped forward. The axe bit deeply at the base of the

spine, and Percy Cuthfert felt all consciousness of his lower limbs

leave him. Then the clerk fell heavily upon him, clutching him by

the throat with feeble fingers. The sharp bite of the axe had caused

Cuthfert to drop the pistol, and as his lungs panted for release, he

fumbled aimlessly for it among the blankets. Then he remembered. He

slid a hand up the clerk's belt to the sheath-knife; and they drew

very close to each other in that last clinch.

  Percy Cuthfert felt his strength leave him. The lower portion of his

body was useless, The inert weight of Weatherbee crushed him-

crushed him and pinned him there like a bear under a trap. The cabin

became filled with a familiar odor, and he knew the bread to be

burning. Yet what did it matter? He would never need it. And there

were all of six cupfuls of sugar in the cache- if he had foreseen this

he would not have been so saving the last several days. Would the

wind-vane ever move? Why not' Had he not seen the sun today? He

would go and see. No; it was impossible to move. He had not thought

the clerk so heavy a man.

  How quickly the cabin cooled! The fire must be out. The cold was

forcing in. It must be below zero already, and the ice creeping up the

inside of the door. He could not see it, but his past experience

enabled him to gauge its progress by the cabin's temperature. The

lower hinge must be white ere now. Would the tale of this ever reach

the world? How would his friends take it? They would read it over

their coffee, most likely, and talk it over at the clubs. He could see

them very clearly, 'Poor Old Cuthfert,' they murmured; 'not such a bad

sort of a chap, after all.' He smiled at their eulogies, and passed on

in search of a Turkish bath. It was the same old crowd upon the

streets. Strange, they did not notice his moosehide moccasins and

tattered German socks! He would take a cab. And after the bath a shave

would not be bad. No; he would eat first. Steak, and potatoes, and

green things how fresh it all was! And what was that? Squares of

honey, streaming liquid amber! But why did they bring so much? Ha! ha!

he could never eat it all. Shine! Why certainly. He put his foot on

the box. The bootblack looked curiously up at him, and he remembered

his moosehide moccasins and went away hastily.

  Hark! The wind-vane must be surely spinning. No; a mere singing in

his ears. That was all- a mere singing. The ice must have passed the

latch by now. More likely the upper hinge was covered. Between the

moss-chinked roof-poles, little points of frost began to appear. How

slowly they grew! No; not so slowly. There was a new one, and there

another. Two- three- four; they were coming too fast to count. There

were two growing together. And there, a third had joined them. Why,

there were no more spots. They had run together and formed a sheet.

  Well, he would have company. If Gabriel ever broke the silence of

the North, they would stand together, hand in hand, before the great

White Throne. And God would judge them, God would judge them!

  Then Percy Cuthfert closed his eyes and dropped off to sleep.

                    TO THE MAN ON THE TRAIL.



  'DUMP IT IN.'

  'But I say, Kid, isn't that going it a little too strong' Whisky and

alcohol's bad enough; but when it comes to brandy and pepper sauce

and-'

  'Dump it in. Who's making this punch, anyway?' And Malemute Kid

smiled benignantly through the clouds of steam. 'By the time you've

been in this country as long as I have, my son, and lived on rabbit

tracks and salmon belly, you'll learn that Christmas comes only once

per annum. And a Christmas without punch is sinking a hole to

bedrock with nary a pay streak.'

  'Stack up on that fer a high cyard,' approved Big Jim Belden, who

had come down from his claim on Mazy May to spend Christmas, and

who, as everyone knew, had been living the two months past on straight

moose meat. 'Hain't fergot the hooch we-uns made on the Tanana, hey

yeh?'

  'Well, I guess yes. Boys, it would have done your hearts good to see

that whole tribe fighting drunk- and all because of a glorious ferment

of sugar and sour dough. That was before your time,' Malemute Kid said

as he turned to Stanley Prince, a young mining expert who had been

in two years. 'No white women in the country then, and Mason wanted to

get married. Ruth's father was chief of the Tananas, and objected,

like the rest of the tribe. Stiff? Why, I used my last pound of sugar;

finest work in that line I ever did in my life. You should have seen

the chase, down the river and across the portage.'

  'But the squaw?' asked Louis Savoy, the tall French Canadian,

becoming interested; for he had heard of this wild deed when at

Forty Mile the preceding winter.

  Then Malemute Kid, who was a born raconteur, told the unvarnished

tale of the Northland Lochinvar. More than one rough adventurer of the

North felt his heartstrings draw closer and experienced vague

yearnings for the sunnier pastures of the Southland, where life

promised something more than a barren struggle with cold and death.

  'We struck the Yukon just behind the first ice run,' he concluded,

'and the tribe only a quarter of an hour behind. But that saved us;

for the second run broke the jam above and shut them out. When they

finally got into Nuklukyeto, the whole post was ready for them. And as

to the forgathering, ask Father Roubeau here: he performed the

ceremony.'

  The Jesuit took the pipe from his lips but could only express his

gratification with patriarchal smiles, while Protestant and Catholic

vigorously applauded.

  'By gar!' ejaculated Louis Savoy, who seemed overcome by the romance

of it. 'La petite squaw: mon Mason brav. By gar!'

  Then, as the first tin cups of punch went round, Bettles the

Unquenchable sprang to his feet and struck up his favorite drinking

song:



               'There's Henry Ward Beecher

               And Sunday-school teachers,

                 All drink of the sassafras root;

               But you bet all the same,

               If it had its right name,

                 It's the juice of the forbidden fruit.'



               'Oh, the juice of the forbidden fruit,'



roared out the bacchanalian chorus,



               'Oh, the juice of the forbidden fruit;

                 But you bet all the same,

                 If it had its right name,

               It's the juice of the forbidden fruit.'



  Malemute Kid's frightful concoction did its work; the men of the

camps and trails unbent in its genial glow, and jest and song and

tales of past adventure went round the board. Aliens from a dozen

lands, they toasted each and all. It was the Englishman, Prince, who

pledged 'Uncle Sam, the precocious infant of the New World'; the

Yankee, Bettles, who drank to 'The Queen, God bless her'; and

together, Savoy and Meyers, the German trader, clanged their cups to

Alsace and Lorraine.

  Then Malemute Kid arose, cup in hand, and glanced at the

greased-paper window, where the frost stood full three inches thick.

'A health to the man on trail this night; may his grub hold out; may

his dogs keep their legs; may his matches never miss fire.'

  Crack! Crack! heard the familiar music of the dog whip, the

whining howl of the Malemutes, and the crunch of a sled as it drew

up to the cabin. Conversation languished while they waited the issue.

  'An old-timer; cares for his dogs and then himself,' whispered

Malemute Kid to Prince as they listened to the snapping jaws and the

wolfish snarls and yelps of pain which proclaimed to their practiced

ears that the stranger was beating back their dogs while he fed his

own.

  Then came the expected knock, sharp and confident, and the

stranger entered. Dazzled by the light, he hesitated a moment at the

door, giving to all a chance for scrutiny. He was a striking

personage, and a most picturesque one, in his Arctic dress of wool and

fur. Standing six foot two or three, with proportionate breadth of

shoulders and depth of chest, his smooth-shaven face nipped by the

cold to a gleaming pink, his long lashes and eyebrows white with

ice, and the ear and neck flaps of his great wolfskin cap loosely

raised, he seemed, of a verity, the Frost King, just stepped in out of

the night. Clasped outside his Mackinaw jacket, a beaded belt held two

large Colt's revolvers and a hunting knife, while he carried, in

addition to the inevitable dog whip, a smokeless rifle of the

largest bore and latest pattern. As he came forward, for all his

step was firm and elastic, they could see that fatigue bore heavily

upon him.

  An awkward silence had fallen, but his hearty 'What cheer, my lads?'

put them quickly at ease, and the next instant Malemute Kid and he had

gripped hands. Though they had never met, each had heard of the other,

and the recognition was mutual. A sweeping introduction and a mug of

punch were forced upon him before he could explain his errand.

  How long since that basket sled, with three men and eight dogs,

passed?' he asked.

  'An even two days ahead. Are you after them?'

  'Yes; my team. Run them off under my very nose, the cusses. I've

gained two days on them already- pick them up on the next run.'

  'Reckon they'll show spunk?' asked Belden, in order to keep up the

conversation, for Malemute Kid already had the coffeepot on and was

busily frying bacon and moose meat.

  The stranger significantly tapped his revolvers.

  'When'd yeh leave Dawson?'

  'Twelve o'clock.'

  'Last night?'- as a matter of course.

  'Today.'

  A murmur of surprise passed round the circle. And well it might; for

it was just midnight, and seventy-five miles of rough river trail

was not to be sneered at for a twelve hours' run.

  The talk soon became impersonal, however, harking back to the trails

of childhood. As the young stranger ate of the rude fare Malemute

Kid attentively studied his face. Nor was he long in deciding that

it was fair, honest, and open, and that he liked it. Still youthful,

the lines had been firmly traced by toil and hardship. Though genial

in conversation, and mild when at rest, the blue eyes gave promise

of the hard steel-glitter which comes when called into action,

especially against odds. The heavy jaw and square-cut chin

demonstrated rugged pertinacity and indomitability. Nor, though the

attributes of the lion were there, was there wanting the certain

softness, the hint of womanliness, which bespoke the emotional nature.

  'So thet's how me an' the ol' woman got spliced,' said Belden,

concluding the exciting tale of his courtship. '"Here we be, Dad," sez

she. "An' may yeh be damned," sez he to her, an' then to me, ''Jim,

yeh-yeh git outen them good duds o' yourn; I want a right peart

slice o' thet forty acre plowed 'fore dinner." An' then he sort o'

sniffled an' kissed her. An' I was thet happy- but he seen me an'

roars out, ''Yeh, Jim!' An' yeh bet I dusted fer the barn.'

  'Any kids waiting for you back in the States?' asked the stranger.

  'Nope; Sal died 'fore any come. Thet's why I'm here.' Belden

abstractedly began to light his pipe, which had failed to go out,

and then brightened up with, 'How 'bout yerself, stranger- married

man?'

  For reply, he opened his watch, slipped it from the thong which

served for a chain, and passed it over. Belden picked up the slush

lamp, surveyed the inside of the case critically, and, swearing

admiringly to himself, handed it over to Louis Savoy. With numerous

'By gars!' he finally surrendered it to Prince, and they noticed

that his hands trembled and his eyes took on a peculiar softness.

And so it passed from horny hand to horny hand- the pasted

photograph of a woman, the clinging kind that such men fancy, with a

babe at the breast. Those who had not yet seen the wonder were keen

with curiosity; those who had became silent and retrospective. They

could face the pinch of famine, the grip of scurvy, or the quick death

by field or flood; but the pictured semblance of a stranger woman

and child made women and children of them all.

  'Never have seen the youngster yet- he's a boy, she says, and two

years old,' said the stranger as he received the treasure back. A

lingering moment he gazed upon it, then snapped the case and turned

away, but not quick enough to hide the restrained rush of tears.

  Malemute Kid led him to a bunk and bade him turn in.

  'Call me at four sharp. Don't fail me,' were his last words, and a

moment later he was breathing in the heaviness of exhausted sleep.

  'By Jove! He's a plucky chap,' commented Prince. 'Three hours' sleep

after seventy-five miles with the dogs, and then the trail again.

Who is he, Kid?'

  'Jack Westondale. Been in going on three years, with nothing but the

name of working like a horse, and any amount of bad luck to his

credit. I never knew him, but Sitka Charley told me about him.'

  'It seems hard that a man with a sweet young wife like his should be

putting in his years in this Godforsaken hole, where every year counts

two on the outside.'

  'The trouble with him is clean grit and stubbornness. He's cleaned

up twice with a stake, but lost it both times.'

  Here the conversation was broken off by an uproar from Bettles,

for the effect had begun to wear away. And soon the bleak years of

monotonous grub and deadening toil were being forgotten in rough

merriment. Malemute Kid alone seemed unable to lose himself, and

cast many an anxious look at his watch. Once he put on his mittens and

beaver-skin cap, and, leaving the cabin, fell to rummaging about in

the cache.

  Nor could he wait the hour designated; for he was fifteen minutes

ahead of time in rousing his guest. The young giant had stiffened

badly, and brisk rubbing was necessary to bring him to his feet. He

tottered painfully out of the cabin, to find his dogs harnessed and

everything ready for the start. The company wished him good luck and a

short chase, while Father Roubeau, hurriedly blessing him, led the

stampede for the cabin; and small wonder, for it is not good to face

seventy-four degrees below zero with naked ears and hands.

  Malemute Kid saw him to the main trail, and there, gripping his hand

heartily, gave him advice.

  'You'll find a hundred pounds of salmon eggs on the sled,' he

said. 'The dogs will go as far on that as with one hundred and fifty

of fish, and you can't get dog food at Pelly, as you probably

expected.' The stranger started, and his eyes flashed, but he did

not interrupt. 'You can't get an ounce of food for dog or man till you

reach Five Fingers, and that's a stiff two hundred miles. Watch out

for open water on the Thirty Mile River, and be sure you take the

big cutoff above Le Barge.'

  'How did you know it? Surely the news can't be ahead of me already?'

  'I don't know it; and what's more, I don't want to know it. But

you never owned that team you're chasing. Sitka Charley sold it to

them last spring. But he sized you up to me as square once, and I

believe him. I've seen your face; I like it. And I've seen- why,

damn you, hit the high places for salt water and that wife of yours,

and-' Here the Kid unmittened and jerked out his sack.

  'No; I don't need it,' and the tears froze on his cheeks as he

convulsively gripped Malemute Kid's hand.

  'Then don't spare the dogs; cut them out of the traces as fast as

they drop; buy them, and think they're cheap at ten dollars a pound.

You can get them at Five Fingers, Little Salmon, and Hootalinqua.

And watch out for wet feet,' was his parting advice. 'Keep a-traveling

up to twenty-five, but if it gets below that, build a fire and

change your socks.'



  Fifteen minutes had barely elapsed when the jingle of bells

announced new arrivals. The door opened, and a mounted policeman of

the Northwest Territory entered, followed by two half-breed dog

drivers. Like Westondale, they were heavily armed and showed signs

of fatigue. The half-breeds had been borne to the trail and bore it

easily; but the young policeman was badly exhausted. Still, the dogged

obstinacy of his race held him to the pace he had set, and would

hold him till he dropped in his tracks.

  'When did Westondale pull out?' he asked. 'He stopped here, didn't

he?' This was supererogatory, for the tracks told their own tale too

well.

  Malemute Kid had caught Belden's eye, and he, scenting the wind,

replied evasively, 'A right peart while back.'

  'Come, my man; speak up,' the policeman admonished.

  'Yeh seem to want him right smart. Hez he ben gittin' cantankerous

down Dawson way?'

  'Held up Harry McFarland's for forty thousand; exchanged it at the

P.C. store for a check on Seattle; and who's to stop the cashing of it

if we don't overtake him? When did he pull out?'

  Every eye suppressed its excitement, for Malemute Kid had given

the cue, and the young officer encountered wooden faces on every hand.

  Striding over to Prince, he put the question to him. Though it

hurt him, gazing into the frank, earnest face. of his fellow

countryman, he replied inconsequentially on the state of the trail.

  Then he espied Father Roubeau, who could not lie. 'A quarter of an

hour ago,' the priest answered; 'but he had four hours' rest for

himself and dogs.'

  'Fifteen minutes' start, and he's fresh! My God!' The poor fellow

staggered back, half fainting from exhaustion and disappointment,

murmuring something about the run from Dawson in ten hours and the

dogs being played out.

  Malemute Kid forced a mug of punch upon him; then he turned for

the door, ordering the dog drivers to follow. But the warmth and

promise of rest were too tempting, and they objected strenuously.

The Kid was conversant with their French patois, and followed it

anxiously.

  They swore that the dogs were gone up; that Siwash and Babette would

have to be shot before the first mile was covered; that the rest were

almost as bad; and that it would be better for all hands to rest up.

  'Lend me five dogs?' he asked, turning to Malemute Kid.

  But the Kid shook his head.

  'I'll sign a check on Captain Constantine for five thousand-

here's my papers- I'm authorized to draw at my own discretion.'

  Again the silent refusal.

  'Then I'll requisition them in the name of the Queen.'

  Smiling incredulously, the Kid glanced at his well-stocked

arsenal, and the Englishman, realizing his impotency, turned for the

door. But the dog drivers still objecting, he whirled upon them

fiercely, calling them women and curs. The swart face of the older

half-breed flushed angrily as he drew himself up and promised in good,

round terms that he would travel his leader off his legs, and would

then be delighted to plant him in the snow.

  The young officer- and it required his whole will- walked steadily

to the door, exhibiting a freshness he did not possess. But they all

knew and appreciated his proud effort; nor could he veil the twinges

of agony that shot across his face. Covered with frost, the dogs

were curled up in the snow, and it was almost impossible to get them

to their feet. The poor brutes whined under the stinging lash, for the

dog drivers were angry and cruel; nor till Babette, the leader, was

cut from the traces, could they break out the sled and get under way.

  'A dirty scoundrel and a liar!' 'By gar! Him no good!' 'A thief!'

'Worse than an Indian!' It was evident that they were angry- first

at the way they had been deceived; and second at the outraged ethics

of the Northland, where honesty, above all, was man's prime jewel.

'An' we gave the cuss a hand, after knowin' what he'd did.' All eyes

turned accusingly upon Malemute Kid, who rose from the corner where he

had been making Babette comfortable, and silently emptied the bowl for

a final round of punch.

  'It's a cold night, boys- a bitter cold night,' was the irrelevant

commencement of his defense. 'You've all traveled trail, and know what

that stands for. Don't jump a dog when he's down. You've only heard

one side. A whiter man than Jack Westondale never ate from the same

pot nor stretched blanket with you or me. Last fall he gave his

whole clean-up, forty thousand, to Joe Castrell, to buy in on

Dominion. Today he'd be a millionaire. But, while he stayed behind

at Circle City, taking care of his partner with the scurvy, what

does Castell do? Goes into McFarland's, jumps the limit, and drops the

whole sack. Found him dead in the snow the next day. And poor Jack

laying his plans to go out this winter to his wife and the boy he's
