<BLOCKQUOTE>Nathaniel Letton was talking when the door opened; he ceased,
and with his two companions gazed with controlled perturbation at Burning
Daylight striding into the room. The free, swinging movements of the trail-traveler
were unconsciously exaggerated in that stride of his. In truth, it seemed
to him that he felt the trail beneath his feet.

<P>"Howdy, gentlemen, howdy," he remarked, ignoring the unnatural calm
with which they greeted his entrance. He shook hands with them in turn,
striding from one to another and gripping their hands so heartily that
Nathaniel Letton could not forbear to wince. Daylight flung himself into
a massive chair and sprawled lazily, with an appearance of fatigue. The
leather grip he had brought into the room he dropped carelessly beside
him on the floor

<P>"Goddle mighty, but I've sure been going some," he sighed. "We sure
trimmed them beautiful. It was real slick. And the beauty of the play never
dawned on me till the very end. It was pure and simple knock down and drag
out. And the way they fell for it was amazin'."

<P>The geniality in his lazy Western drawl reassured them. He was not so
formidable, after all. Despite the act that he had effected an entrance
in the face of Letton's instructions to the outer office, he showed no
indication of making a scene or playing rough.

<P>"Well," Daylight demanded good-humoredly, "ain't you-all got a good
word for your pardner? Or has his sure enough brilliance plumb dazzled
you-all?"

<P>Letton made a dry sound in his throat. Dowsett sat quietly and waited,
while Leon Guggenhammer struggled into articulation.

<P>"You have certainly raised Cain," he said.

<P>Daylight's black eyes flashed in a pleased way.

<P>"Didn't I, though!" he proclaimed jubilantly. "And didn't we fool'em!
I was totally surprised. I never dreamed they would be that easy.

<P>"And now," he went on, not permitting the pause to grow awkward, "we-all
might as well have an accounting. I'm pullin' West this afternoon on that
blamed Twentieth Century." He tugged at his grip, got it open, and dipped
into it with both his hands. "But don't forget, boys, when you-all want
me to hornswoggle Wall Street another flutter, all you-all have to do is
whisper the word. I'll sure be right there with the goods."

<P>His hands emerged, clutching a great mass of stubs, check-books, and
broker's receipts. These he deposited in a heap on the big table, and dipping
again, he fished out the stragglers and added them to the pile. He consulted
a slip of paper, drawn from his coat pocket, and read aloud:-

<P>"Ten million twenty-seven thousand and forty-two dollars and sixty-eight
cents is my figurin' on my expenses. Of course that-all's taken from the
winnings before we-all get to figurin' on the whack-up. Where's your figures?
It must a' been a Goddle mighty big clean-up."

<P>The three men looked their bepuzzlement at one another. The man was
a bigger fool than they had imagined, or else he was playing a game which
they could not divine.

<P>Nathaniel Letton moistened his lips and spoke up.

<P>"It will take some hours yet, Mr. Harnish, before the full accounting
can be made. Mr. Howison is at work upon it now. We--ah--as you say, it
has been a gratifying clean-up. Suppose we have lunch together and talk
it over. I'll have the clerks work through the noon hour, so that you will
have ample time to catch your train."

<P>Dowsett and Guggenhammer manifested a relief that was almost obvious.
The situation was clearing. It was disconcerting, under the circumstances,
to be pent in the same room with this heavy-muscled, Indian-like man whom
they had robbed. They remembered unpleasantly the many stories of his strength
and recklessness. If Letton could only put him off long enough for them
to escape into the policed world outside the office door, all would be
well; and Daylight showed all the signs of being put off.

<P>"I'm real glad to hear that," he said. "I don't want to miss that train,
and you-all have done me proud, gentlemen, letting me in on this deal.
I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings. But
I am sure almighty curious, and I'd like terrible to know, Mr. Letton,
what your figures of our winning is. Can you-all give me a rough estimate?"

<P>Nathaniel Letton did not look appealingly at his two friends, but in
the brief pause they felt that appeal pass out from him. Dowsett, of sterner
mould than the others, began to divine that the Klondiker was playing.
But the other two were still older the blandishment of his child-like innocence.

<P>"It is extremely--er--difficult," Leon Guggenhammer began. "You see,
Ward Valley has fluctuated so, er--"

<P>"That no estimate can possibly be made in advance," Letton supplemented.

<P>"Approximate it, approximate it," Daylight counselled cheerfully.

<P>"It don't hurt if you-all are a million or so out one side or the other.
The figures'll straighten that up. But I'm that curious I'm just itching
all over. What d'ye say?"

<P>"Why continue to play at cross purposes?" Dowsett demanded abruptly
and coldly. "Let us have the explanation here and now. Mr. Harnish is laboring
under a false impression, and he should be set straight. In this deal--"

<P>But Daylight interrupted. He had played too much poker to be unaware
or unappreciative of the psychological factor, and he headed Dowsett off
in order to play the denouncement of the present game in his own way.

<P>"Speaking of deals," he said, "reminds me of a poker game I once seen
in Reno, Nevada. It wa'n't what you-all would call a square game. They-all
was tin-horns that sat in. But they was a tenderfoot--short-horns they-all
are called out there. He stands behind the dealer and sees that same dealer
give hisself four aces offen the bottom of the deck. The tenderfoot is
sure shocked. He slides around to the player facin' the dealer across the
table.

<P>"'Say,' he whispers, 'I seen the dealer deal hisself four aces.'

<P>"'Well, an' what of it?" says the player.

<P>"'I'm tryin' to tell you-all because I thought you-all ought to know,'
says the tenderfoot. 'I tell you-all I seen him deal hisself four aces.'

<P>"'Say, mister,' says the player, 'you-all'd better get outa here. You-all
don't understand the game. It's his deal, ain't it?'"

<P>The laughter that greeted his story was hollow and perfunctory, but
Daylight appeared not to notice it.

<P>"Your story has some meaning, I suppose," Dowsett said pointedly.

<P>Daylight looked at him innocently and did not reply. He turned jovially
to Nathaniel Letton.

<P>"Fire away," he said. "Give us an approximation of our winning. As I
said before, a million out one way or the other won't matter, it's bound
to be such an almighty big winning." By this time Letton was stiffened
by the attitude Dowsett had taken, and his answer was prompt and definite.

<P>"I fear you are under a misapprehension, Mr. Harnish. There are no winnings
to be divided with you. Now don't get excited, I beg of you. I have but
to press this button..."

<P>Far from excited, Daylight had all the seeming of being stunned. He
felt absently in his vest pocket for a match, lighted it, and discovered
that he had no cigarette. The three men watched him with the tense closeness
of cats. Now that it had come, they knew that they had a nasty few minutes
before them.

<P>"Do you-all mind saying that over again?" Daylight said. "Seems to me
I ain't got it just exactly right. You-all said...?"

<P>He hung with painful expectancy on Nathaniel Letton's utterance.

<P>"I said you were under a misapprehension, Mr. Harnish, that was all.
You have been stock gambling, and you have been hard hit. But neither Ward
Valley, nor I, nor my associates, feel that we owe you anything."

<P>Daylight pointed at the heap of receipts and stubs on the table.

<P>"That-all represents ten million twenty-seven thousand and forty-two
dollars and sixty-eight cents, hard cash. Ain't it good for anything here?"

<P>Letton smiled and shrugged his shoulders.

<P>Daylight looked at Dowsett and murmured:--

<P>"I guess that story of mine had some meaning, after all." He laughed
in a sickly fashion. "It was your deal all right, and you-all dole them
right, too. Well, I ain't kicking. I'm like the player in that poker game.
It was your deal, and you-all had a right to do your best. And you d-one
it-cleaned me out slicker'n a whistle."

<P>He gazed at the heap on the table with an air of stupefaction.

<CENTER><B>"'Now it's my Deal, and I'm a-going to see if I can hold them
Four Aces'"</B></CENTER>


<P>"And that-all ain't worth the paper it's written on. Gol dast it, you-all
can sure deal 'em 'round when you get a chance. Oh, no, I ain't a-kicking.
It was your deal, and you-all certainly done me, and a man ain't half a
man that squeals on another man's deal. And now the hand is played out,
and the cards are on the table, and the deal's over, but..."

<P>His hand, dipping swiftly into his inside breast pocket, appeared with
the big Colt's automatic.

<P>"As I was saying, the old deal's finished. Now it's MY deal, and I'm
a-going to see if I can hold them four aces-

<P>"Take your hand away, you whited sepulchre!" he cried sharply.

<P>Nathaniel Letton's hand, creeping toward the push-button on the desk,
was abruptly arrested.

<P>"Change chairs," Daylight commanded. "Take that chair over there, you
gangrene-livered skunk. Jump! By God! or I'll make you leak till folks'll
think your father was a water hydrant and your mother a sprinkling-cart.
You-all move your chair alongside, Guggenhammer; and you-all Dowsett, sit
right there, while I just irrelevantly explain the virtues of this here
automatic. She's loaded for big game and she goes off eight times. She's
a sure hummer when she gets started.

<P>"Preliminary remarks being over, I now proceed to deal. Remember, I
ain't making no remarks about your deal. You done your darndest, and it
was all right. But this is my deal, and it's up to me to do my darndest.
In the first place, you-all know me. I'm Burning Daylight--savvee? Ain't
afraid of God, devil, death, nor destruction. Them's my four aces, and
they sure copper your bets. Look at that there living skeleton. Letton,
you're sure afraid to die. Your bones is all rattling together you're that
scared. And look at that fat Jew there. This little weapon's sure put the
fear of God in his heart. He's yellow as a sick persimmon. Dowsett, you're
a cool one. You-all ain't batted an eye nor turned a hair. That's because
you're great on arithmetic. And that makes you-all dead easy in this deal
of mine. You're sitting there and adding two and two together, and you-all
know I sure got you skinned. You know me, and that I ain't afraid of nothing.
And you-all adds up all your money and knows you ain't a-going to die if
you can help it."

<P>"I'll see you hanged," was Dowsett's retort.

<P>"Not by a damned sight. When the fun starts, you're the first I plug.
I'll hang all right, but you-all won't live to see it. You-all die here
and now while I'll die subject to the law's delay--savvee? Being dead,
with grass growing out of your carcasses, you won't know when I hang, but
I'll sure have the pleasure a long time of knowing you-all beat me to it."

<P>Daylight paused.

<P>"You surely wouldn't kill us?" Letton asked in a queer, thin voice.

<P>Daylight shook his head.

<P>"It's sure too expensive. You-all ain't worth it. I'd sooner have my
chips back. And I guess you-all'd sooner give my chips back than go to
the dead-house."

<P>A long silence followed.

<P>"Well, I've done dealt. It's up to you-all to play. But while you're
deliberating, I want to give you-all a warning: if that door opens and
any one of you cusses lets on there's anything unusual, right here and
then I sure start plugging. They ain't a soul'll get out the room except
feet first."

<P>A long session of three hours followed. The deciding factor was not
the big automatic pistol, but the certitude that Daylight would use it.
Not alone were the three men convinced of this, but Daylight himself was
convinced. He was firmly resolved to kill the men if his money was not
forthcoming. It was not an easy matter, on the spur of the moment, to raise
ten millions in paper currency, and there were vexatious delays. A dozen
times Mr. Howison and the head clerk were summoned into the room. On these
occasions the pistol lay on Daylight's lap, covered carelessly by a newspaper,
while he was usually engaged in rolling or lighting his brown-paper cigarettes.
But in the end, the thing was accomplished. A suit-case was brought up
by one of the clerks from the waiting motor-car, and Daylight snapped it
shut on the last package of bills. He paused at the door to make his final
remarks.

<P>"There's three several things I sure want to tell you-all. When I get
outside this door, you-all'll be set free to act, and I just want to warn
you-all about what to do. In the first place, no warrants for my arrest--savvee?
This money's mine, and I ain't robbed you of it. If it gets out how you
gave me the double-cross and how I done you back again, the laugh'll be
on you, and it'll sure be an almighty big laugh. You-all can't afford that
laugh. Besides, having got back my stake that you-all robbed me of, if
you arrest me and try to rob me a second time, I'll go gunning for you-all,
and I'll sure get you. No little fraid-cat shrimps like you-all can skin
Burning Daylight. If you win you lose, and there'll sure be some several
unexpected funerals around this burg.

<P>Just look me in the eye, and you-all'll savvee I mean business. Them
stubs and receipts on the table is all yourn. Good day."

<P>As the door shut behind him, Nathaniel Letton sprang for the telephone,
and Dowsett intercepted him.

<P>"What are you going to do?" Dowsett demanded.

<P>"The police. It's downright robbery. I won't stand it. I tell you I
won't stand it."

<P>Dowsett smiled grimly, but at the same time bore the slender financier
back and down into his chair.

<P>"We'll talk it over," he said; and in Leon Guggenhammer he found an
anxious ally.

<P>And nothing ever came of it. The thing remained a secret with the three
men. Nor did Daylight ever give the secret away, though that afternoon,
leaning back in his stateroom on the Twentieth Century, his shoes off,
and feet on a chair, he chuckled long and heartily. New York remained forever
puzzled over the affair; nor could it hit upon a rational explanation.
By all rights, Burning Daylight should have gone broke, yet it was known
that he immediately reappeared in San Francisco possessing an apparently
unimpaired capital. This was evidenced by the magnitude of the enterprises
he engaged in, such as, for instance, Panama Mail, by sheer weight of money
and fighting power wresting the control away from Shiftily and selling
out in two months to the Harriman interests at a rumored enormous advance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
