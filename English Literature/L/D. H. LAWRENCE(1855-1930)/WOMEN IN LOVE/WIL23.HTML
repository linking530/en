<P>N<FONT SIZE=-1>EXT DAY</FONT> Birkin sought Ursula out. It happened
to be the half-day at the Grammar School. He appeared towards the end of
the morning, and asked her, would she drive with him in the afternoon.
She consented. But her face was closed and unresponding, and his heart
sank.

<P>The afternoon was fine and dim. He was driving the motor-car, and she
sat beside him. But still her face was closed against him, unresponding.
When she became like this, like a wall against him, his heart contracted.

<P>His life now seemed so reduced, that he hardly cared any more. At moments
it seemed to him he did not care a straw whether Ursula or Hermione or
anybody else existed or did not exist. Why bother! Why strive for a coherent,
satisfied life? Why not drift on in a series of accidents--like a picaresque
novel? Why not? Why bother about human relationships? Why take them seriously--male
or female? Why form any serious connections at all? Why not be casual,
drifting along, taking all for what it was worth?

<P>And yet, still, he was damned and doomed to the old effort at serious
living.

<P>`Look,' he said, `what I bought.' The car was running along a broad
white road, between autumn trees.

<P>He gave her a little bit of screwed-up paper. She took it and opened
it.

<P>`How lovely,' she cried.

<P>She examined the gift.

<P>`How perfectly lovely!' she cried again. `But why do you give them me?'
She put the question offensively.

<P>His face flickered with bored irritation. He shrugged his shoulders
slightly.

<P>`I wanted to,' he said, coolly.

<P>`But why? Why should you?'

<P>`Am I called on to find reasons?' he asked.

<P>There was a silence, whilst she examined the rings that had been screwed
up in the paper.

<P>`I think they are <I>beautiful</I>,' she said, `especially this. This
is wonderful--'

<P>It was a round opal, red and fiery, set in a circle of tiny rubies.

<P>`You like that best?' he said.

<P>`I think I do.'

<P>`I like the sapphire,' he said.

<P>`This?'

<P>It was a rose-shaped, beautiful sapphire, with small brilliants.

<P>`Yes,' she said, `it is lovely.' She held it in the light. `Yes, perhaps
it <I>is</I> the best--'

<P>`The blue--' he said.

<P>`Yes, wonderful--'

<P>He suddenly swung the car out of the way of a farm-cart. It tilted on
the bank. He was a careless driver, yet very quick. But Ursula was frightened.
There was always that something regardless in him which terrified her.
She suddenly felt he might kill her, by making some dreadful accident with
the motor-car. For a moment she was stony with fear.

<P>`Isn't it rather dangerous, the way you drive?' she asked him.

<P>`No, it isn't dangerous,' he said. And then, after a pause: `Don't you
like the yellow ring at all?'

<P>It was a squarish topaz set in a frame of steel, or some other similar
mineral, finely wrought.

<P>`Yes,' she said, `I do like it. But why did you buy these rings?'

<P>`I wanted them. They are second-hand.'

<P>`You bought them for yourself?'

<P>`No. Rings look wrong on my hands.'

<P>`Why did you buy them then?'

<P>`I bought them to give to you.'

<P>`But why? Surely you ought to give them to Hermione! You belong to her.'

<P>He did not answer. She remained with the jewels shut in her hand. She
wanted to try them on her fingers, but something in her would not let her.
And moreover, she was afraid her hands were too large, she shrank from
the mortification of a failure to put them on any but her little finger.
They travelled in silence through the empty lanes.

<P>Driving in a motor-car excited her, she forgot his presence even.

<P>`Where are we?' she asked suddenly.

<P>`Not far from Worksop.'

<P>`And where are we going?'

<P>`Anywhere.'

<P>It was the answer she liked.

<P>She opened her hand to look at the rings. They gave her <I>such</I>
pleasure, as they lay, the three circles, with their knotted jewels, entangled
in her palm. She would have to try them on. She did so secretly, unwilling
to let him see, so that he should not know her finger was too large for
them. But he saw nevertheless. He always saw, if she wanted him not to.
It was another of his hateful, watchful characteristics.

<P>Only the opal, with its thin wire loop, would go on her ring finger.
And she was superstitious. No, there was ill-portent enough, she would
not accept this ring from him in pledge.

<P>`Look,' she said, putting forward her hand, that was half-closed and
shrinking. `The others don't fit me.'

<P>He looked at the red-glinting, soft stone, on her over-sensitive skin.

<P>`Yes,' he said.

<P>`But opals are unlucky, aren't they?' she said wistfully.

<P>`No. I prefer unlucky things. Luck is vulgar. Who wants what <I>luck</I>
would bring? I don't.'

<P>`But why?' she laughed.

<P>And, consumed with a desire to see how the other rings would look on
her hand, she put them on her little finger.

<P>`They can be made a little bigger,' he said.

<P>`Yes,' she replied, doubtfully. And she sighed. She knew that, in accepting
the rings, she was accepting a pledge. Yet fate seemed more than herself.
She looked again at the jewels. They were very beautiful to her eyes--not
as ornament, or wealth, but as tiny fragments of loveliness.

<P>`I'm glad you bought them,' she said, putting her hand, half unwillingly,
gently on his arm.

<P>He smiled, slightly. He wanted her to come to him. But he was angry
at the bottom of his soul, and indifferent. He knew she had a passion for
him, really. But it was not finally interesting. There were depths of passion
when one became impersonal and indifferent, unemotional. Whereas Ursula
was still at the emotional personal level--always so abominably personal.
He had taken her as he had never been taken himself. He had taken her at
the roots of her darkness and shame--like a demon, laughing over the fountain
of mystic corruption which was one of the sources of her being, laughing,
shrugging, accepting, accepting finally. As for her, when would she so
much go beyond herself as to accept him at the quick of death?

<P>She now became quite happy. The motor-car ran on, the afternoon was
soft and dim. She talked with lively interest, analysing people and their
motives--Gudrun, Gerald. He answered vaguely. He was not very much interested
any more in personalities and in people--people were all different, but
they were all enclosed nowadays in a definite limitation, he said; there
were only about two great ideas, two great streams of activity remaining,
with various forms of reaction therefrom. The reactions were all varied
in various people, but they followed a few great laws, and intrinsically
there was no difference. They acted and reacted involuntarily according
to a few great laws, and once the laws, the great principles, were known,
people were no longer mystically interesting. They were all essentially
alike, the differences were only variations on a theme. None of them transcended
the given terms.

<P>Ursula did not agree--people were still an adventure to her--but--perhaps
not as much as she tried to persuade herself. Perhaps there was something
mechanical, now, in her interest. Perhaps also her interest was destructive,
her analysing was a real tearing to pieces. There was an under-space in
her where she did not care for people and their idiosyncracies, even to
destroy them. She seemed to touch for a moment this undersilence in herself,
she became still, and she turned for a moment purely to Birkin.

<P>`Won't it be lovely to go home in the dark?' she said. `We might have
tea rather late--shall we?--and have high tea? Wouldn't that be rather
nice?'

<P>`I promised to be at Shortlands for dinner,' he said.

<P>`But--it doesn't matter--you can go tomorrow--'

<P>`Hermione is there,' he said, in rather an uneasy voice. `She is going
away in two days. I suppose I ought to say good-bye to her. I shall never
see her again.'

<P>Ursula drew away, closed in a violent silence. He knitted his brows,
and his eyes began to sparkle again in anger.

<P>`You don't mind, do you?' he asked irritably.

<P>`No, I don't care. Why should I? Why should I mind?' Her tone was jeering
and offensive.

<P>`That's what I ask myself,' he said; `why <I>should</I> you mind! But
you seem to.' His brows were tense with violent irritation.

<P>`I <I>assure</I> you I don't, I don't mind in the least. Go where you
belong--it's what I want you to do.'

<P>`Ah you fool!' he cried, `with your "go where you belong." It's finished
between Hermione and me. She means much more to <I>you</I>, if it comes
to that, than she does to me. For you can only revolt in pure reaction
from her--and to be her opposite is to be her counterpart.'

<P>`Ah, opposite!' cried Ursula. `I know your dodges. I am not taken in
by your word-twisting. You belong to Hermione and her dead show. Well,
if you do, you do. I don't blame you. But then you've nothing to do with
me.

<P>In his inflamed, overwrought exasperation, he stopped the car, and they
sat there, in the middle of the country lane, to have it out. It was a
crisis of war between them, so they did not see the ridiculousness of their
situation.

<P>`If you weren't a fool, if only you weren't a fool,' he cried in bitter
despair, `you'd see that one could be decent, even when one has been wrong.
I <I>was</I> wrong to go on all those years with Hermione -- it was a deathly
process. But after all, one can have a little human decency. But no, you
would tear my soul out with your jealousy at the very mention of Hermione's
name.'

<P>`I jealous! <I>I</I> -- jealous! You <I>are</I> mistaken if you think
that. I'm not jealous in the least of Hermione, she is nothing to me, not
<I>that!</I>' And Ursula snapped her fingers. `No, it's you who are a liar.
It's you who must return, like a dog to his vomit. It is what Hermione
<I>stands for</I> that I <I>hate</I>. I <I>hate</I> it. It is lies, it
is false, it is death. But you want it, you can't help it, you can't help
yourself. You belong to that old, deathly way of living -- then go back
to it. But don't come to me, for I've nothing to do with it.'

<P>And in the stress of her violent emotion, she got down from the car
and went to the hedgerow, picking unconsciously some flesh-pink spindleberries,
some of which were burst, showing their orange seeds.

<P>`Ah, you are a fool,' he cried, bitterly, with some contempt.

<P>`Yes, I am. I <I>am</I> a fool. And thank God for it. I'm too big a
fool to swallow your cleverness. God be praised. You go to your women --
go to them -- they are your sort -- you've always had a string of them
trailing after you -- and you always will. Go to your spiritual brides
-- but don't come to me as well, because I'm not having any, thank you.
You're not satisfied, are you? Your spiritual brides can't give you what
you want, they aren't common and fleshy enough for you, aren't they? So
you come to me, and keep them in the background! You will marry me for
daily use. But you'll keep yourself well provided with spiritual brides
in the background. I know your dirty little game.' Suddenly a flame ran
over her, and she stamped her foot madly on the road, and he winced, afraid
that she would strike him. `And <I>I, I'm</I> not spiritual enough, <I>I'm</I>
not as spiritual as that Hermione --!' Her brows knitted, her eyes blazed
like a tiger's. `Then go to her, that's all I say, <I>go</I> to her, <I>go</I>.
Ha, she spiritual -- <I>spiritual</I>, she! A dirty materialist as she
is. <I>She</I> spiritual? What does she care for, what is her spirituality?
What <I>is</I> it?' Her fury seemed to blaze out and burn his face. He
shrank a little. `I tell you it's <I>dirt, dirt,</I> and nothing <I>but</I>
dirt. And it's dirt you want, you crave for it. Spiritual! Is <I>that</I>
spiritual, her bullying, her conceit, her sordid materialism? She's a fishwife,
a fishwife, she is such a materialist. And all so sordid. What does she
work out to, in the end, with all her social passion, as you call it. Social
passion -- what social passion has she? -- show it me! -- where is it?
She wants petty, immediate <I>power,</I> she wants the illusion that she
is a great woman, that is all. In her soul she's a devilish unbeliever,
common as dirt. That's what she is at the bottom. And all the rest is pretence
-- but you love it. You love the sham spirituality, it's your food. And
why? Because of the dirt underneath. Do you think I don't know the foulness
of your sex life -- and her's? -- I do. And it's that foulness you want,
you liar. Then have it, have it. You're such a liar.'

<P>She turned away, spasmodically tearing the twigs of spindleberry from
the hedge, and fastening them, with vibrating fingers, in the bosom of
her coat.

<P>He stood watching in silence. A wonderful tenderness burned in him,
at the sight of her quivering, so sensitive fingers: and at the same time
he was full of rage and callousness.

<P>`This is a degrading exhibition,' he said coolly.

<P>`Yes, degrading indeed,' she said. `But more to me than to you.'

<P>`Since you choose to degrade yourself,' he said. Again the flash came
over her face, the yellow lights concentrated in her eyes.

<P>`<I>You!</I>' she cried. `You! You truth-lover! You purity-monger! It
<I>stinks,</I> your truth and your purity. It stinks of the offal you feed
on, you scavenger dog, you eater of corpses. You are foul, <I>foul</I>
and you must know it. Your purity, your candour, your goodness -- yes,
thank you, we've had some. What you are is a foul, deathly thing, obscene,
that's what you are, obscene and perverse. You, and love! You may well
say, you don't want love. No, you want <I>yourself,</I> and dirt, and death
-- that's what you want. You are so <I>perverse,</I> so death-eating. And
then --'

<P>`There's a bicycle coming,' he said, writhing under her loud denunciation.

<P>She glanced down the road.

<P>`I don't care,' she cried.

<P>Nevertheless she was silent. The cyclist, having heard the voices raised
in altercation, glanced curiously at the man, and the woman, and at the
standing motor-car as he passed.

<P>`-- Afternoon,' he said, cheerfully.

<P>`Good-afternoon,' replied Birkin coldly.

<P>They were silent as the man passed into the distance.

<P>A clearer look had come over Birkin's face. He knew she was in the main
right. He knew he was perverse, so spiritual on the one hand, and in some
strange way, degraded, on the other. But was she herself any better? Was
anybody any better?

<P>`It may all be true, lies and stink and all,' he said. `But Hermione's
spiritual intimacy is no rottener than your emotional-jealous intimacy.
One can preserve the decencies, even to one's enemies: for one's own sake.
Hermione is my enemy -- to her last breath! That's why I must bow her off
the field.'

<P>`You! You and your enemies and your bows! A pretty picture you make
of yourself. But it takes nobody in but yourself. I <I>jealous! I!</I>
What I say,' her voice sprang into flame, `I say because it is <I>true,</I>
do you see, because you are <I>you,</I> a foul and false liar, a whited
sepulchre. That's why I say it. And <I>you</I> hear it.'

<P>`And be grateful,' he added, with a satirical grimace.

<P>`Yes,' she cried, `and if you have a spark of decency in you, be grateful.'

<P>`Not having a spark of decency, however --' he retorted.

<P>`No,' she cried, `you haven't a <I>spark.</I> And so you can go your
way, and I'll go mine. It's no good, not the slightest. So you can leave
me now, I don't want to go any further with you -- leave me --'

<P>`You don't even know where you are,' he said.

<P>`Oh, don't bother, I assure you I shall be all right. I've got ten shillings
in my purse, and that will take me back from anywhere <I>you</I> have brought
me to.' She hesitated. The rings were still on her fingers, two on her
little finger, one on her ring finger. Still she hesitated.

<P>`Very good,' he said. `The only hopeless thing is a fool.'

<P>`You are quite right,' she said.

<P>Still she hesitated. Then an ugly, malevolent look came over her face,
she pulled the rings from her fingers, and tossed them at him. One touched
his face, the others hit his coat, and they scattered into the mud.

<P>`And take your rings,' she said, `and go and buy yourself a female elsewhere
-- there are plenty to be had, who will be quite glad to share your spiritual
mess, -- or to have your physical mess, and leave your spiritual mess to
Hermione.'

<P>With which she walked away, desultorily, up the road. He stood motionless,
watching her sullen, rather ugly walk. She was sullenly picking and pulling
at the twigs of the hedge as she passed. She grew smaller, she seemed to
pass out of his sight. A darkness came over his mind. Only a small, mechanical
speck of consciousness hovered near him.

<P>He felt tired and weak. Yet also he was relieved. He gave up his old
position. He went and sat on the bank. No doubt Ursula was right. It was
true, really, what she said. He knew that his spirituality was concomitant
of a process of depravity, a sort of pleasure in self-destruction. There
really <I>was</I> a certain stimulant in self-destruction, for him -- especially
when it was translated spiritually. But then he knew it -- he knew it,
and had done. And was not Ursula's way of emotional intimacy, emotional
and physical, was it not just as dangerous as Hermione's abstract spiritual
intimacy? Fusion, fusion, this horrible fusion of two beings, which every
woman and most men insisted on, was it not nauseous and horrible anyhow,
whether it was a fusion of the spirit or of the emotional body? Hermione
saw herself as the perfect Idea, to which all men must come: And Ursula
was the perfect Womb, the bath of birth, to which all men must come! And
both were horrible. Why could they not remain individuals, limited by their
own limits? Why this dreadful all-comprehensiveness, this hateful tyranny?
Why not leave the other being, free, why try to absorb, or melt, or merge?
One might abandon oneself utterly to the <I>moments,</I> but not to any
other being.

<P>He could not bear to see the rings lying in the pale mud of the road.
He picked them up, and wiped them unconsciously on his hands. They were
the little tokens of the reality of beauty, the reality of happiness in
warm creation. But he had made his hands all dirty and gritty.

<P>There was a darkness over his mind. The terrible knot of consciousness
that had persisted there like an obsession was broken, gone, his life was
dissolved in darkness over his limbs and his body. But there was a point
of anxiety in his heart now. He wanted her to come back. He breathed lightly
and regularly like an infant, that breathes innocently, beyond the touch
of responsibility.

<P>She was coming back. He saw her drifting desultorily under the high
hedge, advancing towards him slowly. He did not move, he did not look again.
He was as if asleep, at peace, slumbering and utterly relaxed.

<P>She came up and stood before him, hanging her head.

<P>`See what a flower I found you,' she said, wistfully holding a piece
of purple-red bell-heather under his face. He saw the clump of coloured
bells, and the tree-like, tiny branch: also her hands, with their over-fine,
over-sensitive skin.

<P>`Pretty!' he said, looking up at her with a smile, taking the flower.
Everything had become simple again, quite simple, the complexity gone into
nowhere. But he badly wanted to cry: except that he was weary and bored
by emotion.

<P>Then a hot passion of tenderness for her filled his heart. He stood
up and looked into her face. It was new and oh, so delicate in its luminous
wonder and fear. He put his arms round her, and she hid her face on his
shoulder.

<P>It was peace, just simple peace, as he stood folding her quietly there
on the open lane. It was peace at last. The old, detestable world of tension
had passed away at last, his soul was strong and at ease.

<P>She looked up at him. The wonderful yellow light in her eyes now was
soft and yielded, they were at peace with each other. He kissed her, softly,
many, many times. A laugh came into her eyes.

<P>`Did I abuse you?' she asked.

<P>He smiled too, and took her hand, that was so soft and given.

<P>`Never mind,' she said, `it is all for the good.' He kissed her again,
softly, many times.

<P>`Isn't it?' she said.

<P>`Certainly,' he replied. `Wait! I shall have my own back.'

<P>She laughed suddenly, with a wild catch in her voice, and flung her
arms around him.

<P>`You are mine, my love, aren't you?' she cried straining him close.

<P>`Yes,' he said, softly.

<P>His voice was so soft and final, she went very still, as if under a
fate which had taken her. Yes, she acquiesced -- but it was accomplished
without her acquiescence. He was kissing her quietly, repeatedly, with
a soft, still happiness that almost made her heart stop beating.

<P>`My love!' she cried, lifting her face and looking with frightened,
gentle wonder of bliss. Was it all real? But his eyes were beautiful and
soft and immune from stress or excitement, beautiful and smiling lightly
to her, smiling with her. She hid her face on his shoulder, hiding before
him, because he could see her so completely. She knew he loved her, and
she was afraid, she was in a strange element, a new heaven round about
her. She wished he were passionate, because in passion she was at home.
But this was so still and frail, as space is more frightening than force.

<P>Again, quickly, she lifted her head.

<P>`Do you love me?' she said, quickly, impulsively.

<P>`Yes,' he replied, not heeding her motion, only her stillness.

<P>She knew it was true. She broke away.

<P>`So you ought,' she said, turning round to look at the road. `Did you
find the rings?'

<P>`Yes.'

<P>`Where are they?'

<P>`In my pocket.'

<P>She put her hand into his pocket and took them out.

<P>She was restless.

<P>`Shall we go?' she said.

<P>`Yes,' he answered. And they mounted to the car once more, and left
behind them this memorable battle-field.

<P>They drifted through the wild, late afternoon, in a beautiful motion
that was smiling and transcendent. His mind was sweetly at ease, the life
flowed through him as from some new fountain, he was as if born out of
the cramp of a womb.

<P>`Are you happy?' she asked him, in her strange, delighted way.

<P>`Yes,' he said.

<P>`So am I,' she cried in sudden ecstacy, putting her arm round him and
clutching him violently against her, as he steered the motor-car.

<P>`Don't drive much more,' she said. `I don't want you to be always doing
something.'

<P>`No,' he said. `We'll finish this little trip, and then we'll be free.'

<P>`We will, my love, we will,' she cried in delight, kissing him as he
turned to her.

<P>He drove on in a strange new wakefulness, the tension of his consciousness
broken. He seemed to be conscious all over, all his body awake with a simple,
glimmering awareness, as if he had just come awake, like a thing that is
born, like a bird when it comes out of an egg, into a new universe.

<P>They dropped down a long hill in the dusk, and suddenly Ursula recognised
on her right hand, below in the hollow, the form of Southwell Minster.

<P>`Are we here!' she cried with pleasure.

<P>The rigid, sombre, ugly cathedral was settling under the gloom of the
coming night, as they entered the narrow town, the golden lights showed
like slabs of revelation, in the shop-windows.

<P>`Father came here with mother,' she said, `when they first knew each
other. He loves it -- he loves the Minster. Do you?'

<P>`Yes. It looks like quartz crystals sticking up out of the dark hollow.
We'll have our high tea at the Saracen's Head.'

<P>As they descended, they heard the Minster bells playing a hymn, when
the hour had struck six.&nbsp;<poem><stanza><l>Glory to thee my God this
night&nbsp;<l>For all the blessings of the light --&nbsp;</stanza></poem>So,
to Ursula's ear, the tune fell out, drop by drop, from the unseen sky on
to the dusky town. It was like dim, bygone centuries sounding. It was all
so far off. She stood in the old yard of the inn, smelling of straw and
stables and petrol. Above, she could see the first stars. What was it all?
This was no actual world, it was the dream-world of one's childhood --
a great circumscribed reminiscence. The world had become unreal. She herself
was a strange, transcendent reality.

<P>They sat together in a little parlour by the fire.

<P>`Is it true?' she said, wondering.

<P>`What?'

<P>`Everything -- is everything true?'

<P>`The best is true,' he said, grimacing at her.

<P>`Is it?' she replied, laughing, but unassured.

<P>She looked at him. He seemed still so separate. New eyes were opened
in her soul. She saw a strange creature from another world, in him. It
was as if she were enchanted, and everything were metamorphosed. She recalled
again the old magic of the Book of Genesis, where the sons of God saw the
daughters of men, that they were fair. And he was one of these, one of
these strange creatures from the beyond, looking down at her, and seeing
she was fair.

<P>He stood on the hearth-rug looking at her, at her face that was upturned
exactly like a flower, a fresh, luminous flower, glinting faintly golden
with the dew of the first light. And he was smiling faintly as if there
were no speech in the world, save the silent delight of flowers in each
other. Smilingly they delighted in each other's presence, pure presence,
not to be thought of, even known. But his eyes had a faintly ironical contraction.

<P>And she was drawn to him strangely, as in a spell. Kneeling on the hearth-rug
before him, she put her arms round his loins, and put her face against
his thigh. Riches! Riches! She was overwhelmed with a sense of a heavenful
of riches.

<P>`We love each other,' she said in delight.

<P>`More than that,' he answered, looking down at her with his glimmering,
easy face.

<P>Unconsciously, with her sensitive fingertips, she was tracing the back
of his thighs, following some mysterious life-flow there. She had discovered
something, something more than wonderful, more wonderful than life itself.
It was the strange mystery of his life-motion, there, at the back of the
thighs, down the flanks. It was a strange reality of his being, the very
stuff of being, there in the straight downflow of the thighs. It was here
she discovered him one of the sons of God such as were in the beginning
of the world, not a man, something other, something more.

<P>This was release at last. She had had lovers, she had known passion.
But this was neither love nor passion. It was the daughters of men coming
back to the sons of God, the strange inhuman sons of God who are in the
beginning.

<P>Her face was now one dazzle of released, golden light, as she looked
up at him, and laid her hands full on his thighs, behind, as he stood before
her. He looked down at her with a rich bright brow like a diadem above
his eyes. She was beautiful as a new marvellous flower opened at his knees,
a paradisal flower she was, beyond womanhood, such a flower of luminousness.
Yet something was tight and unfree in him. He did not like this crouching,
this radiance -- not altogether.

<P>It was all achieved, for her. She had found one of the sons of God from
the Beginning, and he had found one of the first most luminous daughters
of men.

<P>She traced with her hands the line of his loins and thighs, at the back,
and a living fire ran through her, from him, darkly. It was a dark flood
of electric passion she released from him, drew into herself. She had established
a rich new circuit, a new current of passional electric energy, between
the two of them, released from the darkest poles of the body and established
in perfect circuit. It was a dark fire of electricity that rushed from
him to her, and flooded them both with rich peace, satisfaction.

<P>`My love,' she cried, lifting her face to him, her eyes, her mouth open
in transport.

<P>`My love,' he answered, bending and kissing her, always kissing her.

<P>She closed her hands over the full, rounded body of his loins, as he
stooped over her, she seemed to touch the quick of the mystery of darkness
that was bodily him. She seemed to faint beneath, and he seemed to faint,
stooping over her. It was a perfect passing away for both of them, and
at the same time the most intolerable accession into being, the marvellous
fullness of immediate gratification, overwhelming, out-flooding from the
source of the deepest life-force, the darkest, deepest, strangest life-source
of the human body, at the back and base of the loins.

<P>After a lapse of stillness, after the rivers of strange dark fluid richness
had passed over her, flooding, carrying away her mind and flooding down
her spine and down her knees, past her feet, a strange flood, sweeping
away everything and leaving her an essential new being, she was left quite
free, she was free in complete ease, her complete self. So she rose, stilly
and blithe, smiling at him. He stood before her, glimmering, so awfully
real, that her heart almost stopped beating. He stood there in his strange,
whole body, that had its marvellous fountains, like the bodies of the sons
of God who were in the beginning. There were strange fountains of his body,
more mysterious and potent than any she had imagined or known, more satisfying,
ah, finally, mystically-physically satisfying. She had thought there was
no source deeper than the phallic source. And now, behold, from the smitten
rock of the man's body, from the strange marvellous flanks and thighs,
deeper, further in mystery than the phallic source, came the floods of
ineffable darkness and ineffable riches.

<P>They were glad, and they could forget perfectly. They laughed, and went
to the meal provided. There was a venison pasty, of all things, a large
broad-faced cut ham, eggs and cresses and red beet-root, and medlars and
apple-tart, and tea.

<P>`What <I>good</I> things!' she cried with pleasure. `How noble it looks!
-- shall I pour out the tea? --'

<P>She was usually nervous and uncertain at performing these public duties,
such as giving tea. But today she forgot, she was at her ease, entirely
forgetting to have misgivings. The tea-pot poured beautifully from a proud
slender spout. Her eyes were warm with smiles as she gave him his tea.
She had learned at last to be still and perfect.

<P>`Everything is ours,' she said to him.

<P>`Everything,' he answered.

<P>She gave a queer little crowing sound of triumph.

<P>`I'm so glad!' she cried, with unspeakable relief.

<P>`So am I,' he said. `But I'm thinking we'd better get out of our responsibilities
as quick as we can.'

<P>`What responsibilities?' she asked, wondering.

<P>`We must drop our jobs, like a shot.'

<P>A new understanding dawned into her face.

<P>`Of course,' she said, `there's that.'

<P>`We must get out,' he said. `There's nothing for it but to get out,
quick.'

<P>She looked at him doubtfully across the table.

<P>`But where?' she said.

<P>`I don't know,' he said. `We'll just wander about for a bit.'

<P>Again she looked at him quizzically.

<P>`I should be perfectly happy at the Mill,' she said.

<P>`It's very near the old thing,' he said. `Let us wander a bit.'

<P>His voice could be so soft and happy-go-lucky, it went through her veins
like an exhilaration. Nevertheless she dreamed of a valley, and wild gardens,
and peace. She had a desire too for splendour -- an aristocratic extravagant
splendour. Wandering seemed to her like restlessness, dissatisfaction.

<P>`Where will you wander to?' she asked.

<P>`I don't know. I feel as if I would just meet you and we'd set off --
just towards the distance.'

<P>`But where can one go?' she asked anxiously. `After all, there is only
the world, and none of it is very distant.'

<P>`Still,' he said, `I should like to go with you -- nowhere. It would
be rather wandering just to nowhere. That's the place to get to -- nowhere.
One wants to wander away from the world's somewheres, into our own nowhere.'

<P>Still she meditated.

<P>`You see, my love,' she said, `I'm so afraid that while we are only
people, we've got to take the world that's given -- because there isn't
any other.'

<P>`Yes there is,' he said. `There's somewhere where we can be free --
somewhere where one needn't wear much clothes -- none even -- where one
meets a few people who have gone through enough, and can take things for
granted -- where you be yourself, without bothering. There is somewhere
-- there are one or two people --'

<P>`But where --?' she sighed.

<P>`Somewhere -- anywhere. Let's wander off. That's the thing to do --
let's wander off.'

<P>`Yes --' she said, thrilled at the thought of travel. But to her it
was only travel.

<P>`To be free,' he said. `To be free, in a free place, with a few other
people!'

<P>`Yes,' she said wistfully. Those `few other people' depressed her.

<P>`It isn't really a locality, though,' he said. `It's a perfected relation
between you and me, and others -- the perfect relation -- so that we are
free together.'

<P>`It is, my love, isn't it,' she said. `It's you and me. It's you and
me, isn't it?' She stretched out her arms to him. He went across and stooped
to kiss her face. Her arms closed round him again, her hands spread upon
his shoulders, moving slowly there, moving slowly on his back, down his
back slowly, with a strange recurrent, rhythmic motion, yet moving slowly
down, pressing mysteriously over his loins, over his flanks. The sense
of the awfulness of riches that could never be impaired flooded her mind
like a swoon, a death in most marvellous possession, mystic-sure. She possessed
him so utterly and intolerably, that she herself lapsed out. And yet she
was only sitting still in the chair, with her hands pressed upon him, and
lost.

<P>Again he softly kissed her.

<P>`We shall never go apart again,' he murmured quietly. And she did not
speak, but only pressed her hands firmer down upon the source of darkness
in him.

<P>They decided, when they woke again from the pure swoon, to write their
resignations from the world of work there and then. She wanted this.

<P>He rang the bell, and ordered note-paper without a printed address.
The waiter cleared the table.

<P>`Now then,' he said, `yours first. Put your home address, and the date
-- then "Director of Education, Town Hall -- Sir --" Now then! -- I don't
know how one really stands -- I suppose one could get out of it in less
than month -- Anyhow "Sir -- I beg to resign my post as classmistress in
the Willey Green Grammar School. I should be very grateful if you would
liberate me as soon as possible, without waiting for the expiration of
the month's notice." That'll do. Have you got it? Let me look. "Ursula
Brangwen." Good! Now I'll write mine. I ought to give them three months,
but I can plead health. I can arrange it all right.'

<P>He sat and wrote out his formal resignation.

<P>`Now,' he said, when the envelopes were sealed and addressed, `shall
we post them here, both together? I know Jackie will say, "Here's a coincidence!"
when he receives them in all their identity. Shall we let him say it, or
not?'

<P>`I don't care,' she said.

<P>`No --?' he said, pondering.

<P>`It doesn't matter, does it?' she said.

<P>`Yes,' he replied. `Their imaginations shall not work on us. I'll post
yours here, mine after. I cannot be implicated in their imaginings.'

<P>He looked at her with his strange, non-human singleness.

<P>`Yes, you are right,' she said.

<P>She lifted her face to him, all shining and open. It was as if he might
enter straight into the source of her radiance. His face became a little
distracted.

<P>`Shall we go?' he said.

<P>`As you like,' she replied.

<P>They were soon out of the little town, and running through the uneven
lanes of the country. Ursula nestled near him, into his constant warmth,
and watched the pale-lit revelation racing ahead, the visible night. Sometimes
it was a wide old road, with grass-spaces on either side, flying magic
and elfin in the greenish illumination, sometimes it was trees looming
overhead, sometimes it was bramble bushes, sometimes the walls of a crew-yard
and the butt of a barn.

<P>`Are you going to Shortlands to dinner?' Ursula asked him suddenly.
He started.

<P>`Good God!' he said. `Shortlands! Never again. Not that. Besides we
should be too late.'

<P>`Where are we going then -- to the Mill?'

<P>`If you like. Pity to go anywhere on this good dark night. Pity to come
out of it, really. Pity we can't stop in the good darkness. It is better
than anything ever would be -- this good immediate darkness.'

<P>She sat wondering. The car lurched and swayed. She knew there was no
leaving him, the darkness held them both and contained them, it was not
to be surpassed Besides she had a full mystic knowledge of his suave loins
of darkness, dark-clad and suave, and in this knowledge there was some
of the inevitability and the beauty of fate, fate which one asks for, which
one accepts in full.

<P>He sat still like an Egyptian Pharoah, driving the car. He felt as if
he were seated in immemorial potency, like the great carven statues of
real Egypt, as real and as fulfilled with subtle strength, as these are,
with a vague inscrutable smile on the lips. He knew what it was to have
the strange and magical current of force in his back and loins, and down
his legs, force so perfect that it stayed him immobile, and left his face
subtly, mindlessly smiling. He knew what it was to be awake and potent
in that other basic mind, the deepest physical mind. And from this source
he had a pure and magic control, magical, mystical, a force in darkness,
like electricity.

<P>It was very difficult to speak, it was so perfect to sit in this pure
living silence, subtle, full of unthinkable knowledge and unthinkable force,
upheld immemorially in timeless force, like the immobile, supremely potent
Egyptians, seated forever in their living, subtle silence.

<P>`We need not go home,' he said. `This car has seats that let down and
make a bed, and we can lift the hood.'

<P>She was glad and frightened. She cowered near to him.

<P>`But what about them at home?' she said.

<P>`Send a telegram.'

<P>Nothing more was said. They ran on in silence. But with a sort of second
consciousness he steered the car towards a destination. For he had the
free intelligence to direct his own ends. His arms and his breast and his
head were rounded and living like those of the Greek, he had not the unawakened
straight arms of the Egyptian, nor the sealed, slumbering head. A lambent
intelligence played secondarily above his pure Egyptian concentration in
darkness.

<P>They came to a village that lined along the road. The car crept slowly
along, until he saw the post-office. Then he pulled up.

<P>`I will send a telegram to your father,' he said. `I will merely say
"spending the night in town," shall I?'

<P>`Yes,' she answered. She did not want to be disturbed into taking thought.

<P>She watched him move into the post-office. It was also a shop, she saw.
Strange, he was. Even as he went into the lighted, public place he remained
dark and magic, the living silence seemed the body of reality in him, subtle,
potent, indiscoverable. There he was! In a strange uplift of elation she
saw him, the being never to be revealed, awful in its potency, mystic and
real. This dark, subtle reality of him, never to be translated, liberated
her into perfection, her own perfected being. She too was dark and fulfilled
in silence.

<P>He came out, throwing some packages into the car.

<P>`There is some bread, and cheese, and raisins, and apples, and hard
chocolate,' he said, in his voice that was as if laughing, because of the
unblemished stillness and force which was the reality in him. She would
have to touch him. To speak, to see, was nothing. It was a travesty to
look and to comprehend the man there. Darkness and silence must fall perfectly
on her, then she could know mystically, in unrevealed touch. She must lightly,
mindlessly connect with him, have the knowledge which is death of knowledge,
the reality of surety in not-knowing.

<P>Soon they had run on again into the darkness. She did not ask where
they were going, she did not care. She sat in a fullness and a pure potency
that was like apathy, mindless and immobile. She was next to him, and hung
in a pure rest, as a star is hung, balanced unthinkably. Still there remained
a dark lambency of anticipation. She would touch him. With perfect fine
finger-tips of reality she would touch the reality in him, the suave, pure,
untranslatable reality of his loins of darkness. To touch, mindlessly in
darkness to come in pure touching upon the living reality of him, his suave
perfect loins and thighs of darkness, this was her sustaining anticipation.

<P>And he too waited in the magical steadfastness of suspense, for her
to take this knowledge of him as he had taken it of her. He knew her darkly,
with the fullness of dark knowledge. Now she would know him, and he too
would be liberated. He would be night-free, like an Egyptian, steadfast
in perfectly suspended equilibrium, pure mystic nodality of physical being.
They would give each other this star-equilibrium which alone is freedom.

<P>She saw that they were running among trees -- great old trees with dying
bracken undergrowth. The palish, gnarled trunks showed ghostly, and like
old priests in the hovering distance, the fern rose magical and mysterious.
It was a night all darkness, with low cloud. The motor-car advanced slowly.

<P>`Where are we?' she whispered.

<P>`In Sherwood Forest.'

<P>It was evident he knew the place. He drove softly, watching. Then they
came to a green road between the trees. They turned cautiously round, and
were advancing between the oaks of the forest, down a green lane. The green
lane widened into a little circle of grass, where there was a small trickle
of water at the bottom of a sloping bank. The car stopped.

<P>`We will stay here,' he said, `and put out the lights.'

<P>He extinguished the lamps at once, and it was pure night, with shadows
of trees like realities of other, nightly being. He threw a rug on to the
bracken, and they sat in stillness and mindless silence. There were faint
sounds from the wood, but no disturbance, no possible disturbance, the
world was under a strange ban, a new mystery had supervened. They threw
off their clothes, and he gathered her to him, and found her, found the
pure lambent reality of her forever invisible flesh. Quenched, inhuman,
his fingers upon her unrevealed nudity were the fingers of silence upon
silence, the body of mysterious night upon the body of mysterious night,
the night masculine and feminine, never to be seen with the eye, or known
with the mind, only known as a palpable revelation of living otherness.

<P>She had her desire of him, she touched, she received the maximum of
unspeakable communication in touch, dark, subtle, positively silent, a
magnificent gift and give again, a perfect acceptance and yielding, a mystery,
the reality of that which can never be known, vital, sensual reality that
can never be transmuted into mind content, but remains outside, living
body of darkness and silence and subtlety, the mystic body of reality.
She had her desire fulfilled. He had his desire fulfilled. For she was
to him what he was to her, the immemorial magnificence of mystic, palpable,
real otherness.

<P>They slept the chilly night through under the hood of the car, a night
of unbroken sleep. It was already high day when he awoke. They looked at
each other and laughed, then looked away, filled with darkness and secrecy.
Then they kissed and remembered the magnificence of the night. It was so
magnificent, such an inheritance of a universe of dark reality, that they
were afraid to seem to remember. They hid away the remembrance and the
knowledge.
