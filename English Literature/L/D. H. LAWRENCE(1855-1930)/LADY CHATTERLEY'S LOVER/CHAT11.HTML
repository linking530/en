<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Connie was sorting out one of the Wragby lumber rooms. There were several:
the house was a warren, and the family never sold anything. Sir Geoffery's
father had liked pictures and Sir Geoffery's mother had liked <I>cinquecento</I>
furniture. Sir Geoffery himself had liked old carved oak chests, vestry
chests. So it went on through the generations. Clifford collected very
modern pictures, at very moderate prices.

<P>So in the lumber room there were bad Sir Edwin Landseers and pathetic
William Henry Hunt birds' nests: and other Academy stuff, enough to frighten
the daughter of an R.A. She determined to look through it one day, and
clear it all. And the grotesque furniture interested her.

<P>Wrapped up carefully to preserve it from damage and dry-rot was the
old family cradle, of rosewood. She had to unwrap it, to look at it. It
had a certain charm: she looked at it a longtime.

<P>`It's thousand pities it won't be called for,' sighed Mrs Bolton, who
was helping. `Though cradles like that are out of date nowadays.'

<P>`It might be called for. I might have a child,' said Connie casually,
as if saying she might have a new hat.

<P>`You mean if anything happened to Sir Clifford!' stammered Mrs Bolton.

<P>`No! I mean as things are. It's only muscular paralysis with Sir Clifford---it
doesn't affect him,' said Connie, lying as naturally as breathing.

<P>Clifford had put the idea into her head. He had said: `Of course I may
have a child yet. I'm not really mutilated at all. The potency may easily
come back, even if the muscles of the hips and legs are paralysed. And
then the seed may be transferred.'

<P>He really felt, when he had his periods of energy and worked so hard
at the question of the mines, as if his sexual potency were returning.
Connie had looked at him in terror. But she was quite quick-witted enough
to use his suggestion for her own preservation. For she would have a child
if she could: but not his.

<P>Mrs Bolton was for a moment breathless, flabbergasted. Then she didn't
believe it: she saw in it a ruse. Yet doctors could do such things nowadays.
They might sort of graft seed.

<P>`Well, my Lady, I only hope and pray you may. It would be lovely for
you: and for everybody. My word, a child in Wragby, what a difference it
would make!'

<P>`Wouldn't it!' said Connie.

<P>And she chose three R. A. pictures of sixty years ago, to send to the
Duchess of Shortlands for that lady's next charitable bazaar. She was called
`the bazaar duchess', and she always asked all the county to send things
for her to sell. She would be delighted with three framed R. A.s. She might
even call, on the strength of them. How furious Clifford was when she called!

<P>But oh my dear! Mrs Bolton was thinking to herself. Is it Oliver Mellors'
child you're preparing us for? Oh my dear, that <I>would</I> be a Tevershall
baby in the Wragby cradle, my word! Wouldn't shame it, neither!

<P>Among other monstrosities in this lumber room was a largish blackjapanned
box, excellently and ingeniously made some sixty or seventy years ago,
and fitted with every imaginable object. On top was a concentrated toilet
set: brushes, bottles, mirrors, combs, boxes, even three beautiful little
razors in safety sheaths, shaving-bowl and all. Underneath came a sort
of <I>escritoire</I> outfit: blotters, pens, ink-bottles, paper, envelopes,
memorandum books: and then a perfect sewing-outfit, with three different
sized scissors, thimbles, needles, silks and cottons, darning egg, all
of the very best quality and perfectly finished. Then there was a little
medicine store, with bottles labelled Laudanum, Tincture of Myrrh, Ess.
Cloves and so on: but empty. Everything was perfectly new, and the whole
thing, when shut up, was as big as a small, but fat weekend bag. And inside,
it fitted together like a puzzle. The bottles could not possibly have spilled:
there wasn't room.

<P>The thing was wonderfully made and contrived, excellent craftsmanship
of the Victorian order. But somehow it was monstrous. Some Chatterley must
even have felt it, for the thing had never been used. It had a peculiar
soullessness.

<P>Yet Mrs Bolton was thrilled.

<P>`Look what beautiful brushes, so expensive, even the shaving brushes,
three perfect ones! No! and those scissors! They're the best that money
could buy. Oh, I call it lovely!'

<P>`Do you?' said Connie. `Then you have it.'

<P>`Oh no, my Lady!'

<P>`Of course! It will only lie here till Doomsday. If you won't have it,
I'll send it to the Duchess as well as the pictures, and she doesn't deserve
so much. Do have it!'

<P>`Oh, your Ladyship! Why, I shall never be able to thank you.'

<P>`You needn't try,' laughed Connie.

<P>And Mrs Bolton sailed down with the huge and very black box in her arms,
flushing bright pink in her excitement.

<P>Mr Betts drove her in the trap to her house in the village, with the
box. And she <I>had</I> to have a few friends in, to show it: the school-mistress,
the chemist's wife, Mrs Weedon the undercashier's wife. They thought it
marvellous. And then started the whisper of Lady Chatterley's child.

<P>`Wonders'll never cease!' said Mrs Weedon.

<P>But Mrs Bolton was <I>convinced</I>, if it did come, it would be Sir
Clifford's child. So there!

<P>Not long after, the rector said gently to Clifford:

<P>`And may we really hope for an heir to Wragby? Ah, that would be the
hand of God in mercy, indeed!'

<P>`Well! We may <I>hope</I>,' said Clifford, with a faint irony, and at
the same time, a certain conviction. He had begun to believe it really
possible it might even be <I>his</I> child.

<P>Then one afternoon came Leslie Winter, Squire Winter, as everybody called
him: lean, immaculate, and seventy: and every inch a gentleman, as Mrs
Bolton said to Mrs Betts. Every millimetre indeed! And with his old-fashioned,
rather haw-haw! manner of speaking, he seemed more out of date than bag
wigs. Time, in her flight, drops these fine old feathers.

<P>They discussed the collieries. Clifford's idea was, that his coal, even
the poor sort, could be made into hard concentrated fuel that would burn
at great heat if fed with certain damp, acidulated air at a fairly strong
pressure. It had long been observed that in a particularly strong, wet
wind the pit-bank burned very vivid, gave off hardly any fumes, and left
a fine powder of ash, instead of the slow pink gravel.

<P>`But where will you find the proper engines for burning your fuel?'
asked Winter.

<P>`I'll make them myself. And I'll use my fuel myself. And I'll sell electric
power. I'm certain I could do it.'

<P>`If you can do it, then splendid, splendid, my dear boy. Haw! Splendid!
If I can be of any help, I shall be delighted. I'm afraid I am a little
out of date, and my collieries are like me. But who knows, when I'm gone,
there may be men like you. Splendid! It will employ all the men again,
and you won't have to sell your coal, or fail to sell it. A splendid idea,
and I hope it will be a success. If I had sons of my own, no doubt they
would have up-to-date ideas for Shipley: no doubt! By the way, dear boy,
is there any foundation to the rumour that we may entertain hopes of an
heir to Wragby?'

<P>`Is there a rumour?' asked Clifford.

<P>`Well, my dear boy, Marshall from Fillingwood asked me, that's all I
can say about a rumour. Of course I wouldn't repeat it for the world, if
there were no foundation.'

<P>`Well, Sir,' said Clifford uneasily, but with strange bright eyes. `There
is a hope. There is a hope.'

<P>Winter came across the room and wrung Clifford's hand.

<P>`My dear boy, my dear lad, can you believe what it means to me, to hear
that! And to hear you are working in the hopes of a son: and that you may
again employ every man at Tevershall. Ah, my boy! to keep up the level
of the race, and to have work waiting for any man who cares to work!---'

<P>The old man was really moved.

<P>Next day Connie was arranging tall yellow tulips in a glass vase.

<P>`Connie,' said Clifford, `did you know there was a rumour that you are
going to supply Wragby with a son and heir?'

<P>Connie felt dim with terror, yet she stood quite still, touching the
flowers.

<P>`No!' she said. `Is it a joke? Or malice?'

<P>He paused before he answered:

<P>`Neither, I hope. I hope it may be a prophecy.'

<P>Connie went on with her flowers.

<P>`I had a letter from Father this morning,' She said. `He wants to know
if I am aware he has accepted Sir Alexander Cooper's Invitation for me
for July and August, to the Villa Esmeralda in Venice.'

<P>`July <I>and</I> August?' said Clifford.

<P>`Oh, I wouldn't stay all that time. Are you sure you wouldn't come?'

<P>`I won't travel abroad,' said Clifford promptly. She took her flowers
to the window.

<P>`Do you mind if I go?' she said. You know it was promised, for this
summer.

<P>`For how long would you go?'

<P>`Perhaps three weeks.'

<P>There was silence for a time.

<P>`Well,' said Clifford slowly, and a little gloomily. `I suppose I could
stand it for three weeks: if I were absolutely sure you'd want to come
back.'

<P>`I should want to come back,' she said, with a quiet simplicity, heavy
with conviction. She was thinking of the other man.

<P>Clifford felt her conviction, and somehow he believed her, he believed
it was for him. He felt immensely relieved, joyful at once.

<P>`In that case,' he said,

<P>`I think it would be all right, don't you?'

<P>`I think so,' she said.

<P>`You'd enjoy the change?' She looked up at him with strange blue eyes.

<P>`I should like to see Venice again,' she said, `and to bathe from one
of the shingle islands across the lagoon. But you know I loathe the Lido!
And I don't fancy I shall like Sir Alexander Cooper and Lady Cooper. But
if Hilda is there, and we have a gondola of our own: yes, it will be rather
lovely. I <I>do</I> wish you'd come.'

<P>She said it sincerely. She would so love to make him happy, in these
ways.

<P>`Ah, but think of me, though, at the Gare du Nord: at Calais quay!'

<P>`But why not? I see other men carried in litter-chairs, who have been
wounded in the war. Besides, we'd motor all the way.'

<P>`We should need to take two men.'

<P>`Oh no! We'd manage with Field. There would always be another man there.'

<P>But Clifford shook his head.

<P>`Not this year, dear! Not this year! Next year probably I'll try.'

<P>She went away gloomily. Next year! What would next year bring? She herself
did not really want to go to Venice: not now, now there was the other man.
But she was going as a sort of discipline: and also because, if she had
a child, Clifford could think she had a lover in Venice.

<P>It was already May, and in June they were supposed to start. Always
these arrangements! Always one's life arranged for one! Wheels that worked
one and drove one, and over which one had no real control!

<P>It was May, but cold and wet again. A cold wet May, good for corn and
hay! Much the corn and hay matter nowadays! Connie had to go into Uthwaite,
which was their little town, where the Chatterleys were still <I>the</I>
Chatterleys. She went alone, Field driving her.

<P>In spite of May and a new greenness, the country was dismal. It was
rather chilly, and there was smoke on the rain, and a certain sense of
exhaust vapour in the air. One just had to live from one's resistance.
No wonder these people were ugly and tough.

<P>The car ploughed uphill through the long squalid straggle of Tevershall,
the blackened brick dwellings, the black slate roofs glistening their sharp
edges, the mud black with coal-dust, the pavements wet and black. It was
as if dismalness had soaked through and through everything. The utter negation
of natural beauty, the utter negation of the gladness of life, the utter
absence of the instinct for shapely beauty which every bird and beast has,
the utter death of the human intuitive faculty was appalling. The stacks
of soap in the grocers' shops, the rhubarb and lemons in the greengrocers!
the awful hats in the milliners! all went by ugly, ugly, ugly, followed
by the plaster-and-gilt horror of the cinema with its wet picture announcements,
`A Woman's Love!', and the new big Primitive chapel, primitive enough in
its stark brick and big panes of greenish and raspberry glass in the windows.
The Wesleyan chapel, higher up, was of blackened brick and stood behind
iron railings and blackened shrubs. The Congregational chapel, which thought
itself superior, was built of rusticated sandstone and had a steeple, but
not a very high one. Just beyond were the new school buildings, expensivink
brick, and gravelled playground inside iron railings, all very imposing,
and fixing the suggestion of a chapel and a prison. Standard Five girls
were having a singing lesson, just finishing the la-me-doh-la exercises
and beginning a `sweet children's song'. Anything more unlike song, spontaneous
song, would be impossible to imagine: a strange bawling yell that followed
the outlines of a tune. It was not like savages: savages have subtle rhythms.
It was not like animals: animals <I>mean</I> something when they yell.
It was like nothing on earth, and it was called singing. Connie sat and
listened with her heart in her boots, as Field was filling petrol. What
could possibly become of such a people, a people in whom the living intuitive
faculty was dead as nails, and only queer mechanical yells and uncanny
will-power remained?

<P>A coal-cart was coming downhill, clanking in the rain. Field started
upwards, past the big but weary-looking drapers and clothing shops, the
post-office, into the little market-place of forlorn space, where Sam Black
was peering out of the door of the Sun, that called itself an inn, not
a pub, and where the commercial travellers stayed, and was bowing to Lady
Chatterley's car.

<P>The church was away to the left among black trees. The car slid on downhill,
past the Miners' Arms. It had already passed the Wellington, the Nelson,
the Three Tuns, and the Sun, now it passed the Miners' Arms, then the Mechanics'
Hall, then the new and almost gaudy Miners' Welfare and so, past a few
new `villas', out into the blackened road between dark hedges and dark
green fields, towards Stacks Gate.

<P>Tevershall! That was Tevershall! Merrie England! Shakespeare's England!
No, but the England of today, as Connie had realized since she had come
to live in it. It was producing a new race of mankind, over-conscious in
the money and social and political side, on the spontaneous, intuitive
side dead, but dead. Half-corpses, all of them: but with a terrible insistent
consciousness in the other half. There was something uncanny and underground
about it all. It was an under-world. And quite incalculable. How shall
we understand the reactions in half-corpses? When Connie saw the great
lorries full of steel-workers from Sheffield, weird, distorted smallish
beings like men, off for an excursion to Matlock, her bowels fainted and
she thought: Ah God, what has man done to man? What have the leaders of
men been doing to their fellow men? They have reduced them to less than
humanness; and now there can be no fellowship any more! It is just a nightmare.

<P>She felt again in a wave of terror the grey, gritty hopelessness of
it all. With such creatures for the industrial masses, and the upper classes
as she knew them, there was no hope, no hope any more. Yet she was wanting
a baby, and an heir to Wragby! An heir to Wragby! She shuddered with dread.

<P>Yet Mellors had come out of all this!---Yes, but he was as apart from
it all as she was. Even in him there was no fellowship left. It was dead.
The fellowship was dead. There was only apartness and hopelessness, as
far as all this was concerned. And this was England, the vast bulk of England:
as Connie knew, since she had motored from the centre of it.

<P>The car was rising towards Stacks Gate. The rain was holding off, and
in the air came a queer pellucid gleam of May. The country rolled away
in long undulations, south towards the Peak, east towards Mansfield and
Nottingham. Connie was travelling South.

<P>As she rose on to the high country, she could see on her left, on a
height above the rolling land, the shadowy, powerful bulk of Warsop Castle,
dark grey, with below it the reddish plastering of miners' dwellings, newish,
and below those the plumes of dark smoke and white steam from the great
colliery which put so many thousand pounds per annum into the pockets of
the Duke and the other shareholders. The powerful old castle was a ruin,
yet it hung its bulk on the low sky-line, over the black plumes and the
white that waved on the damp air below.

<P>A turn, and they ran on the high level to Stacks Gate. Stacks Gate,
as seen from the highroad, was just a huge and gorgeous new hotel, the
Coningsby Arms, standing red and white and gilt in barbarous isolation
off the road. But if you looked, you saw on the left rows of handsome `modern'
dwellings, set down like a game of dominoes, with spaces and gardens, a
queer game of dominoes that some weird `masters' were playing on the surprised
earth. And beyond these blocks of dwellings, at the back, rose all the
astonishing and frightening overhead erections of a really modern mine,
chemical works and long galleries, enormous, and of shapes not before known
to man. The head-stock and pit-bank of the mine itself were insignificant
among the huge new installations. And in front of this, the game of dominoes
stood forever in a sort of surprise, waiting to be played.

<P>This was Stacks Gate, new on the face of the earth, since the war. But
as a matter of fact, though even Connie did not know it, downhill half
a mile below the `hotel' was old Stacks Gate, with a little old colliery
and blackish old brick dwellings, and a chapel or two and a shop or two
and a little pub or two.

<P>But that didn't count any more. The vast plumes of smoke and vapour
rose from the new works up above, and this was now Stacks Gate: no chapels,
no pubs, even no shops. Only the great works', which are the modern Olympia
with temples to all the gods; then the model dwellings: then the hotel.
The hotel in actuality was nothing but a miners' pub though it looked first-classy.

<P>Even since Connie's arrival at Wragby this new place had arisen on the
face of the earth, and the model dwellings had filled with riff-raff drifting
in from anywhere, to poach Clifford's rabbits among other occupations.

<P>The car ran on along the uplands, seeing the rolling county spread out.
The county! It had once been a proud and lordly county. In front, looming
again and hanging on the brow of the sky-line, was the huge and splendid
bulk of Chadwick Hall, more window than wall, one of the most famous Elizabethan
houses. Noble it stood alone above a great park, but out of date, passed
over. It was still kept up, but as a show place. `Look how our ancestors
lorded it!'

<P>That was the past. The present lay below. God alone knows where the
future lies. The car was already turning, between little old blackened
miners' cottages, to descend to Uthwaite. And Uthwaite, on a damp day,
was sending up a whole array of smoke plumes and steam, to whatever gods
there be. Uthwaite down in the valley, with all the steel threads of the
railways to Sheffield drawn through it, and the coal-mines and the steel-works
sending up smoke and glare from long tubes, and the pathetic little corkscrew
spire of the church, that is going to tumble down, still pricking the fumes,
always affected Connie strangely. It was an old market-town, centre of
the dales. One of the chief inns was the Chatterley Arms. There, in Uthwaite,
Wragby was known as Wragby, as if it were a whole place, not just a house,
as it was to outsiders: Wragby Hall, near Tevershall: Wragby, a `seat'.

<P>The miners' cottages, blackened, stood flush on the pavement, with that
intimacy and smallness of colliers' dwellings over a hundred years old.
They lined all the way. The road had become a street, and as you sank,
you forgot instantly the open, rolling country where the castles and big
houses still dominated, but like ghosts. Now you were just above the tangle
of naked railway-lines, and foundries and other `works' rose about you,
so big you were only aware of walls. And iron clanked with a huge reverberating
clank, and huge lorries shook the earth, and whistles screamed.

<P>Yet again, once you had got right down and into the twisted and crooked
heart of the town, behind the church, you were in the world of two centuries
ago, in the crooked streets where the Chatterley Arms stood, and the old
pharmacy, streets which used to lead Out to the wild open world of the
castles and stately couchant houses.

<P>But at the corner a policeman held up his hand as three lorries loaded
with iron rolled past, shaking the poor old church. And not till the lorries
were past could he salute her ladyship.

<P>So it was. Upon the old crooked burgess streets hordes of oldish blackened
miners' dwellings crowded, lining the roads out. And immediately after
these came the newer, pinker rows of rather larger houses, plastering the
valley: the homes of more modern workmen. And beyond that again, in the
wide rolling regions of the castles, smoke waved against steam, and patch
after patch of raw reddish brick showed the newer mining settlements, sometimes
in the hollows, sometimes gruesomely ugly along the sky-line of the slopes.
And between, in between, were the tattered remnants of the old coaching
and cottage England, even the England of Robin Hood, where the miners prowled
with the dismalness of suppressed sporting instincts, when they were not
at work.

<P>England, my England! But which is <I>my</I> England? The stately homes
of England make good photographs, and create the illusion of a connexion
with the Elizabethans. The handsome old halls are there, from the days
of Good Queen Anne and Tom Jones. But smuts fall and blacken on the drab
stucco, that has long ceased to be golden. And one by one, like the stately
homes, they were abandoned. Now they are being pulled down. As for the
cottages of England---there they are---great plasterings of brick dwellings
on the hopeless countryside.

<P>`Now they are pulling down the stately homes, the Georgian halls are
going. Fritchley, a perfect old Georgian mansion, was even now, as Connie
passed in the car, being demolished. It was in perfect repair: till the
war the Weatherleys had lived in style there. But now it was too big, too
expensive, and the country had become too uncongenial. The gentry were
departing to pleasanter places, where they could spend their money without
having to see how it was made.'

<P>This is history. One England blots out another. The mines had made the
halls wealthy. Now they were blotting them out, as they had already blotted
out the cottages. The industrial England blots out the agricultural England.
One meaning blots out another. The new England blots out the old England.
And the continuity is not Organic, but mechanical.

<P>Connie, belonging to the leisured classes, had clung to the remnants
of the old England. It had taken her years to realize that it was really
blotted out by this terrifying new and gruesome England, and that the blotting
out would go on till it was complete. Fritchley was gone, Eastwood was
gone, Shipley was going: Squire Winter's beloved Shipley.

<P>Connie called for a moment at Shipley. The park gates, at the back,
opened just near the level crossing of the colliery railway; the Shipley
colliery itself stood just beyond the trees. The gates stood open, because
through the park was a right-of-way that the colliers used. They hung around
the park.

<P>The car passed the ornamental ponds, in which the colliers threw their
newspapers, and took the private drive to the house. It stood above, aside,
a very pleasant stucco building from the middle of the eighteenth century.
It had a beautiful alley of yew trees, that had approached an older house,
and the hall stood serenely spread out, winking its Georgian panes as if
cheerfully. Behind, there were really beautiful gardens.

<P>Connie liked the interior much better than Wragby. It was much lighter,
more alive, shapen and elegant. The rooms were panelled with creamy painted
panelling, the ceilings were touched with gilt, and everything was kept
in exquisite order, all the appointments were perfect, regardless of expense.
Even the corridors managed to be ample and lovely, softly curved and full
of life.

<P>But Leslie Winter was alone. He had adored his house. But his park was
bordered by three of his own collieries. He had been a generous man in
his ideas. He had almost welcomed the colliers in his park. Had the miners
not made him rich! So, when he saw the gangs of unshapely men lounging
by his ornamental waters---not in the <I>private</I> part of the park,
no, he drew the line there---he would say: `the miners are perhaps not
so ornamental as deer, but they are far more profitable.'

<P>But that was in the golden---monetarily---latter half of Queen Victoria's
reign. Miners were then `good working men'.

<P>Winter had made this speech, half apologetic, to his guest, the then
Prince of Wales. And the Prince had replied, in his rather guttural English:

<P>`You are quite right. If there were coal under Sandringham, I would
open a mine on the lawns, and think it first-rate landscape gardening.
Oh, I am quite willing to exchange roe-deer for colliers, at the price.
Your men are good men too, I hear.'

<P>But then, the Prince had perhaps an exaggerated idea of the beauty of
money, and the blessings of industrialism.

<P>However, the Prince had been a King, and the King had died, and now
there was another King, whose chief function seemed to be to open soup-kitchens.

<P>And the good working men were somehow hemming Shipley in. New mining
villages crowded on the park, and the squire felt somehow that the population
was alien. He used to feel, in a good-natured but quite grand way, lord
of his own domain and of his own colliers. Now, by a subtle pervasion of
the new spirit, he had somehow been pushed out. It was he who did not belong
any more. There was no mistaking it. The mines, the industry, had a will
of its own, and this will was against the gentleman-owner. All the colliers
took part in the will, and it was hard to live up against it. It either
shoved you out of the place, or out of life altogether.

<P>Squire Winter, a soldier, had stood it out. But he no longer cared to
walk in the park after dinner. He almost hid, indoors. Once he had walked,
bare-headed, and in his patent-leather shoes and purple silk socks, with
Connie down to the gate, talking to her in his well-bred rather haw-haw
fashion. But when it came to passing the little gangs of colliers who stood
and stared without either salute or anything else, Connie felt how the
lean, well-bred old man winced, winced as an elegant antelope stag in a
cage winces from the vulgar stare. The colliers were not <I>personally</I>
hostile: not at all. But their spirit was cold, and shoving him out. And,
deep down, there was a profound grudge. They `worked for him'. And in their
ugliness, they resented his elegant, well-groomed, well-bred existence.
`Who's he!' It was the <I>difference</I> they resented.

<P>And somewhere, in his secret English heart, being a good deal of a soldier,
he believed they were right to resent the difference. He felt himself a
little in the wrong, for having all the advantages. Nevertheless he represented
a system, and he would not be shoved out.

<P>Except by death. Which came on him soon after Connie's call, suddenly.
And he remembered Clifford handsomely in his will.

<P>The heirs at once gave out the order for the demolishing of Shipley.
It cost too much to keep up. No one would live there. So it was broken
up. The avenue of yews was cut down. The park was denuded of its timber,
and divided into lots. It was near enough to Uthwaite. In the strange,
bald desert of this still-one-more no-man's-land, new little streets of
semi-detacheds were run up, very desirable! The Shipley Hall Estate!

<P>Within a year of Connie's last call, it had happened. There stood Shipley
Hall Estate, an array of red-brick semi-detached `villas' in new streets.
No one would have dreamed that the stucco hall had stood there twelve months
before.

<P>But this is a later stage of King Edward's landscape gardening, the
sort that has an ornamental coal-mine on the lawn.

<P>One England blots out another. The England of the Squire Winters and
the Wragby Halls was gone, dead. The blotting out was only not yet complete.

<P>What would come after? Connie could not imagine. She could only see
the new brick streets spreading into the fields, the new erections rising
at the collieries, the new girls in their silk stockings, the new collier
lads lounging into the Pally or the Welfare. The younger generation were
utterly unconscious of the old England. There was a gap in the continuity
of consciousness, almost American: but industrial really. What next?

<P>Connie always felt there was no next. She wanted to hide her head in
the sand: or, at least, in the bosom of a living man.

<P>The world was so complicated and weird and gruesome! The common people
were so many, and really so terrible. So she bought as she was going home,
and saw the colliers trailing from the pits, grey-black, distorted, one
shoulder higher than the other, slurring their heavy ironshod boots. Underground
grey faces, whites of eyes rolling, necks cringing from the pit roof, shoulders
Out of shape. Men! Men! Alas, in some ways patient and good men. In other
ways, non-existent. Something that men <I>should</I> have was bred and
killed out of them. Yet they were men. They begot children. One might bear
a child to them. Terrible, terrible thought! They were good and kindly.
But they were only half, Only the grey half of a human being. As yet, they
were `good'. But even that was the goodness of their halfness. Supposing
the dead in them ever rose up! But no, it was too terrible to think of.
Connie was absolutely afraid of the industrial masses. They seemed so <I>weird</I>
to her. A life with utterly no beauty in it, no intuition, always `in the
pit'.

<P>Children from such men! Oh God, oh God!

<P>Yet Mellors had come from such a father. Not quite. Forty years had
made a difference, an appalling difference in manhood. The iron and the
coal had eaten deep into the bodies and souls of the men.

<P>Incarnate ugliness, and yet alive! What would become of them all? Perhaps
with the passing of the coal they would disappear again, off the face of
the earth. They had appeared out of nowhere in their thousands, when the
coal had called for them. Perhaps they were only weird fauna of the coal-seams.
Creatures of another reality, they were elementals, serving the elements
of coal, as the metal-workers were elementals, serving the element of iron.
Men not men, but animas of coal and iron and clay. Fauna of the elements,
carbon, iron, silicon: elementals. They had perhaps some of the weird,
inhuman beauty of minerals, the lustre of coal, the weight and blueness
and resistance of iron, the transparency of glass. Elemental creatures,
weird and distorted, of the mineral world! They belonged to the coal, the
iron, the clay, as fish belong to the sea and worms to dead wood. The anima
of mineral disintegration!

<P>Connie was glad to be home, to bury her head in the sand. She was glad
even to babble to Clifford. For her fear of the mining and iron Midlands
affected her with a queer feeling that went all over her, like influenza.

<P>`Of course I had to have tea in Miss Bentley's shop,' she said.

<P>`Really! Winter would have given you tea.'

<P>`Oh yes, but I daren't disappoint Miss Bentley.' Miss Bentley was a
shallow old maid with a rather large nose and romantic disposition who
served tea with a careful intensity worthy of a sacrament.

<P>`Did she ask after me?' said Clifford.

<P>`Of course!---. <I>May</I> I ask your Ladyship how Sir Clifford is!---I
believe she ranks you even higher than Nurse Cavell!'

<P>`And I suppose you said I was blooming.'

<P>`Yes! And she looked as rapt as if I had said the heavens had opened
to you. I said if she ever came to Tevershall she was to come to see you.'

<P>`Me! Whatever for! See me!'

<P>`Why yes, Clifford. You can't be so adored without making some slight
return. Saint George of Cappadocia was nothing to you, in her eyes.'

<P>`And do you think she'll come?'

<P>`Oh, she blushed! and looked quite beautiful for a moment, poor thing!
Why don't men marry the women who would really adore them?'

<P>`The women start adoring too late. But did she say she'd come?'

<P>`Oh!' Connie imitated the breathless Miss Bentley, `your Ladyship, if
ever I should dare to presume!'

<P>`Dare to presume! how absurd! But I hope to God she won't turn up. And
how was her tea?'

<P>`Oh, Lipton's and <I>very</I> strong. But Clifford, do you realize you
are the <I>Roman de la rose</I> of Miss Bentley and lots like her?'

<P>`I'm not flattered, even then.'

<P>`They treasure up every one of your pictures in the illustrated papers,
and probably pray for you every night. It's rather wonderful.'

<P>She went upstairs to change.

<P>That evening he said to her:

<P>`You do think, don't you, that there is something eternal in marriage?'

<P>She looked at him.

<P>`But Clifford, you make eternity sound like a lid or a long, long chain
that trailed after one, no matter how far one went.'

<P>He looked at her, annoyed.

<P>`What I mean,' he said, `is that if you go to Venice, you won't go in
the hopes of some love affair that you can take <I>au grand s&eacute;rieux</I>,
will you?'

<P>`A love affair in Venice <I>au grand s&eacute;rieux</I>? No. I assure
you! No, I'd never take a love affair in Venice more than <I>au tr&egrave;s
petit s&eacute;rieux</I>.'

<P>She spoke with a queer kind of contempt. He knitted his brows, looking
at her.

<P>Coming downstairs in the morning, she found the keeper's dog Flossie
sitting in the corridor outside Clifford's room, and whimpering very faintly.

<P>`Why, Flossie!' she said softly. `What are you doing here?'

<P>And she quietly opened Clifford's door. Clifford was sitting up in bed,
with the bed-table and typewriter pushed aside, and the keeper was standing
at attention at the foot of the bed. Flossie ran in. With a faint gesture
of head and eyes, Mellors ordered her to the door again, and she slunk
out.

<P>`Oh, good morning, Clifford!' Connie said. `I didn't know you were busy.'
Then she looked at the keeper, saying good morning to him. He murmured
his reply, looking at her as if vaguely. But she felt a whiff of passion
touch her, from his mere presence.

<P>`Did I interrupt you, Clifford? I'm sorry.'

<P>`No, it's nothing of any importance.'

<P>She slipped out of the room again, and up to the blue boudoir on the
first floor. She sat in the window, and saw him go down the drive, with
his curious, silent motion, effaced. He had a natural sort of quiet distinction,
an aloof pride, and also a certain look of frailty. A hireling! One of
Clifford's hirelings! `The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but
in ourselves, that we are underlings.'

<P>Was he an underling? Was he? What did he think of <I>her</I>?

<P>It was a sunny day, and Connie was working in the garden, and Mrs Bolton
was helping her. For some reason, the two women had drawn together, in
one of the unaccountable flows and ebbs of sympathy that exist between
people. They were pegging down carnations, and putting in small plants
for the summer. It was work they both liked. Connie especially felt a delight
in putting the soft roots of young plants into a soft black puddle, and
cradling them down. On this spring morning she felt a quiver in her womb
too, as if the sunshine had touched it and made it happy.

<P>`It is many years since you lost your husband?' she said to Mrs Bolton
as she took up another little plant and laid it in its hole.

<P>`Twenty-three!' said Mrs Bolton, as she carefully separated the young
columbines into single plants. `Twenty-three years since they brought him
home.'

<P>Connie's heart gave a lurch, at the terrible finality of it. `Brought
him home!'

<P>`Why did he get killed, do you think?' she asked. `He was happy with
you?'

<P>It was a woman's question to a woman. Mrs Bolton put aside a strand
of hair from her face, with the back of her hand.

<P>`I don't know, my Lady! He sort of wouldn't give in to things: he wouldn't
really go with the rest. And then he hated ducking his head for anything
on earth. A sort of obstinacy, that gets itself killed. You see he didn't
really care. I lay it down to the pit. He ought never to have been down
pit. But his dad made him go down, as a lad; and then, when you're over
twenty, it's not very easy to come out.'

<P>`Did he say he hated it?'

<P>`Oh no! Never! He never said he hated anything. He just made a funny
face. He was one of those who wouldn't take care: like some of the first
lads as went off so blithe to the war and got killed right away. He wasn't
really wezzle-brained. But he wouldn't care. I used to say to him: "You
care for nought nor nobody!" But he did! The way he sat when my first baby
was born, motionless, and the sort of fatal eyes he looked at me with,
when it was over! I had a bad time, but I had to comfort <I>him</I>. "It's
all right, lad, it's all right!" I said to him. And he gave me a look,
and that funny sort of smile. He never said anything. But I don't believe
he had any right pleasure with me at nights after; he'd never really let
himself go. I used to say to him: Oh, let thysen go, lad!---I'd talk broad
to him sometimes. And he said nothing. But he wouldn't let himself go,
or he couldn't. He didn't want me to have any more children. I always blamed
his mother, for letting him in th' room. He'd no right t'ave been there.
Men makes so much more of things than they should, once they start brooding.'

<P>`Did he mind so much?' said Connie in wonder.

<P>`Yes, he sort of couldn't take it for natural, all that pain. And it
spoilt his pleasure in his bit of married love. I said to him: If I don't
care, why should you? It's my look-out!---But all he'd ever say was: It's
not right!'

<P>`Perhaps he was too sensitive,' said Connie.

<P>`That's it! When you come to know men, that's how they are: too sensitive
in the wrong place. And I believe, unbeknown to himself he hated the pit,
just hated it. He looked so quiet when he was dead, as if he'd got free.
He was such a nice-looking lad. It just broke my heart to see him, so still
and pure looking, as if he'd <I>wanted</I> to die. Oh, it broke my heart,
that did. But it was the pit.'

<P>She wept a few bitter tears, and Connie wept more. It was a warm spring
day, with a perfume of earth and of yellow flowers, many things rising
to bud, and the garden still with the very sap of sunshine.

<P>`It must have been terrible for you!' said Connie.

<P>`Oh, my Lady! I never realized at first. I could only say: Oh my lad,
what did you want to leave me for!---That was all my cry. But somehow I
felt he'd come back.'

<P>`But he <I>didn't</I> want to leave you,' said Connie.

<P>`Oh no, my Lady! That was only my silly cry. And I kept expecting him
back. Especially at nights. I kept waking up thinking: Why he's not in
bed with me!---It was as if <I>my feelings</I> wouldn't believe he'd gone.
I just felt he'd <I>have</I> to come back and lie against me, so I could
feel him with me. That was all I wanted, to feel him there with me, warm.
And it took me a thousand shocks before I knew he wouldn't come back, it
took me years.'

<P>`The touch of him,' said Connie.

<P>`That's it, my Lady, the touch of him! I've never got over it to this
day, and never shall. And if there's a heaven above, he'll be there, and
will lie up against me so I can sleep.'

<P>Connie glanced at the handsome, brooding face in fear. Another passionate
one out of Tevershall! The touch of him! For the bonds of love are ill
to loose!

<P>`It's terrible, once you've got a man into your blood!' she said. `Oh,
my Lady! And that's what makes you feel so bitter. You feel folks <I>wanted</I>
him killed. You feel the pit fair <I>wanted</I> to kill him. Oh, I felt,
if it hadn't been for the pit, an' them as runs the pit, there'd have been
no leaving me. But they all <I>want</I> to separate a woman and a man,
if they're together.'

<P>`If they're physically together,' said Connie.

<P>`That's right, my Lady! There's a lot of hard-hearted folks in the world.
And every morning when he got up and went to th' pit, I felt it was wrong,
wrong. But what else could he do? What can a man do?'

<P>A queer hate flared in the woman.

<P>`But can a touch last so long?' Connie asked suddenly. `That you could
feel him so long?'

<P>`Oh my Lady, what else is there to last? Children grows away from you.
But the man, well! But even <I>that</I> they'd like to kill in you, the
very thought of the touch of him. Even your own children! Ah well! We might
have drifted apart, who knows. But the feeling's something different. It's
'appen better never to care. But there, when I look at women who's never
really been warmed through by a man, well, they seem to me poor doolowls
after all, no matter how they may dress up and gad. No, I'll abide by my
own. I've not much respect for people.'
