<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on

<P>that morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless

<P>sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were.&nbsp; Quite
flushed

<P>with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,

<P>whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at

<P>the dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up

<P>to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others

<P>waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in

<P>garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown

<P>flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and

<P>fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so

<P>long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and

<P>sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day,

<P>making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty.

<P>Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have.&nbsp; "I don't

<P>want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love,

<P>and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender

<P>hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart.&nbsp; her sisters braided

<P>up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies

<P>of the valley, which `her John' liked best of all the flowers that

<P>grew.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet

<P>and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,"

<P>cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I am satisfied.&nbsp; But please hug and kiss me, everyone,

<P>and don't mind my dress.&nbsp; I want a great many crumples of this

<P>sort put into it today."&nbsp; And Meg opened her arms to her sisters,

<P>who clung about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that

<P>the new love had not changed the old.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay

<P>a few minutes with Father quietly in the study."&nbsp; And Meg ran

<P>down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her

<P>mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles

<P>on the motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly

<P>heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches

<P>to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few

<P>changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for

<P>all are looking their best just now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself

<P>with ease, if not grace.&nbsp; The curly crop has lengthened into

<P>a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall

<P>figure.&nbsp; There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine

<P>in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.&nbsp; The

<P>beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression

<P>that saddens one, although it is not sad itself.&nbsp; It is the shadow

<P>of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience,

<P>but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of `being

<P>better soon'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy is with truth considered `the flower of the family', for

<P>at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not

<P>beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace.

<P>One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her

<P>hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious

<P>yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself.&nbsp; Amy's

<P>nose still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did

<P>her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided chin.&nbsp; These offending

<P>features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it,

<P>and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion,

<P>keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for

<P>the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three

<P>looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing

<P>a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest

<P>chapter in the romance of womanhood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was

<P>to be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived,

<P>she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead
her in,

<P>to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down,

<P>and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs

<P>with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, here's a state of things!" cried the old lady,

<P>taking the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds

<P>of her lavender moire with a great rustle.&nbsp; "You oughtn't to be

<P>seen till the last minute, child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me,

<P>to criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon.&nbsp; I'm too

<P>happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have

<P>my little wedding just as I like it.&nbsp; John, dear, here's your

<P>hammer."&nbsp; And away went Meg to help `that man' in his highly

<P>improper employment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Brooke didn't even say, "Thank you," but as he stooped

<P>for the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the

<P>folding door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her

<P>pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the

<P>indecorous exclamation, "Jupiter Ammon!&nbsp; Jo's upset the cake again!"

<P>caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of

<P>cousins arrived, and `the party came in', as Beth used to say when

<P>a child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse

<P>than mosquitoes," whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled

<P>and Laurie's black head towered above the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly

<P>elegant if he likes," returned Amy, and gliding away to warn

<P>Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt

<P>the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon

<P>the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under

<P>the green arch.&nbsp; Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath
to

<P>give Meg up.&nbsp; The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only

<P>seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn.&nbsp; The bridegroom's

<P>hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies.&nbsp; But Meg

<P>looked straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, "I will!"

<P>with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother's

<P>heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only

<P>saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was

<P>staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and

<P>emotion in his wicked black eyes.&nbsp; Beth kept her face hidden on
her

<P>mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a

<P>most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the

<P>flower in her hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was

<P>fairly married, Meg cried, "The first kiss for Marmee!" and turning,

<P>gave it with her heart on her lips.&nbsp; During the next fifteen minutes

<P>she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves

<P>of their privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence

<P>to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully and

<P>wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob

<P>and a chuckle, "Bless you, deary, a hundred times!&nbsp; The cake ain't

<P>hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant,

<P>or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when

<P>hearts are light.&nbsp; There was no display of gifts, for they were

<P>already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast,

<P>but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers.

<P>Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when

<P>water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of

<P>nectar which the three Hebes carried around.&nbsp; No one said anything,

<P>till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her,

<P>with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?" he whispered,

<P>"or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying

<P>about loose this morning?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt

<P>March actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth,

<P>and dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home.&nbsp; You know he thinks

<P>that wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that

<P>neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man

<P>under her roof."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh,

<P>but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in

<P>his impetuous way, "I like that!&nbsp; For I've seen enough harm done

<P>to wish other women would think as you do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?" And there was

<P>an anxious accent in Meg's voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No.&nbsp; I give you my word for it.&nbsp; Don't think too well of
me,

<P>either, this is not one of my temptations.&nbsp; Being brought up where

<P>wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for

<P>it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse,

<P>you see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own.

<P>Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the

<P>happiest day of my life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate

<P>a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial.

<P>Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs,

<P>and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good.

<P>She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very

<P>eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, "No one can refuse

<P>me anything today."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he

<P>gave her his hand, saying heartily, "I promise, Mrs. Brooke!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thank you, very, very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I drink `long life to your resolution', Teddy," cried Jo,

<P>baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and

<P>beamed approvingly upon him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in

<P>spite of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls

<P>seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he

<P>thanked them all his life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through

<P>the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.&nbsp;
Meg

<P>and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass

<P>plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the

<P>finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made

<P>husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters

<P>prance in couples outside!" cried Laurie, promenading down the path

<P>with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else

<P>followed their example without a murmur.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt

<P>and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie

<P>Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm

<P>and whisked Ned into the ring.&nbsp; But the crowning joke was Mr.

<P>Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chass'ed

<P>solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under arm, and

<P>hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the

<P>bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies

<P>on a midsummer day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then

<P>people began to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think

<P>you'll be sorry for it," said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the

<P>bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, "You've got a treasure,

<P>young man, see that you deserve it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and

<P>I don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it," observed

<P>Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of

<P>thing, get one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be

<P>perfectly satisfied," said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his

<P>easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir," was Laurie's unusually

<P>dutiful reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his

<P>buttonhole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey

<P>Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new.

<P>When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her

<P>dovecolored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered

<P>about her to say goodby, as tenderly as if she had been going to

<P>make the grand tour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that

<P>I love you any the less for loving John so much," she said, clinging

<P>to her mother, with full eyes for a moment.&nbsp; "I shall come every
day,

<P>Father, and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I

<P>am married.&nbsp; Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the
other

<P>girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles.

<P>Thank you all for my happy wedding day.&nbsp; Goodby, goodby!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and

<P>tender pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with

<P>her hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy

<P>face--and so Meg's married life began.
