<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,"

<P>said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon,

<P>looking out at the frostbitten garden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's the reason I was born in it," observed Jo pensively,

<P>quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should

<P>think it a delightful month," said Beth, who took a hopeful view

<P>of everything, even November.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this

<P>family," said Meg, who was out of sorts.&nbsp; "We go grubbing along

<P>day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun.&nbsp; We

<P>might as well be in a treadmill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My patience, how blue we are!" cried Jo.&nbsp; "I don't much

<P>wonder, poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times,

<P>while you grind, grind, year in and year out.&nbsp; Oh, don't I wish

<P>I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines!&nbsp; You're

<P>pretty enough and good enough already, so I'd have some rich relation

<P>leave you a fortune unexpectedly.&nbsp; Then you'd dash out as an heiress,

<P>scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady

<P>Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays,

<P>men have to work and women marry for money.&nbsp; It's a dreadfully
unjust

<P>world," said Meg bitterly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all.&nbsp; Just wait ten

<P>years, and see if we don't," said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud

<P>pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and

<P>faces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt,

<P>though I'm grateful for your good intentions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.&nbsp; Jo

<P>groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude,

<P>but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other

<P>window, said, smiling, "Two pleasant things are going to happen

<P>right away.&nbsp; Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping

<P>through the garden as if he had something nice to tell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, "Any letter

<P>from Father, girls?" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, "Won't

<P>some of you come for a drive?&nbsp; I've been working away at mathematics

<P>till my head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a

<P>brisk turn.&nbsp; It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going
to

<P>take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out.&nbsp; Come,

<P>Jo, you and Beth will go, won't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course we will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Much obliged, but I'm busy."&nbsp; And Meg whisked out her workbasket,

<P>for she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least,

<P>not to drive too often with the young gentleman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We three will be ready in a minute," cried Amy, running away to

<P>wash her hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?" asked Laurie, leaning

<P>over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always

<P>gave her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind,

<P>dear.&nbsp; It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been.&nbsp;
Father

<P>is as regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in

<P>with a letter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum," she said,

<P>handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At the word `telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two

<P>lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if

<P>the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart.&nbsp; Laurie dashed

<P>downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read

<P>aloud, in a frightened voice...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March:

<P>Your husband is very ill.&nbsp; Come at once.

<P>S.&nbsp; HALE

<P>Blank Hospital, Washington.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how

<P>strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world

<P>seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling

<P>as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be

<P>taken from them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over,

<P>and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they

<P>never forgot, "I shall go at once, but it may be too late.&nbsp; Oh,

<P>children, children, help me to bear it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing

<P>in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances

<P>of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.&nbsp; Poor Hannah

<P>was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the

<P>rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea for most

<P>afflictions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Lord keep the dear man!&nbsp; I won't waste no time a-cryin',

<P>but git your things ready right away, mum," she said heartily, as she

<P>wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the

<P>hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women

<P>in one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's right, there's no time for tears now.&nbsp; Be calm, girls,

<P>and let me think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up,

<P>looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan

<P>for them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where's Laurie?' she asked presently, when she had collected

<P>her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here, ma'am.&nbsp; Oh, let me do something!" cried the boy,

<P>hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that

<P>their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Send a telegram saying I will come at once.&nbsp; The next train

<P>goes early in the morning.&nbsp; I'll take that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What else?&nbsp; The horses are ready.&nbsp; I can go anywhere, do

<P>anything," he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Leave a note at Aunt March's.&nbsp; Jo, give me that pen and paper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages,

<P>Jo drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the

<P>long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do

<P>anything to add to a little to the sum for her father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate

<P>pace.&nbsp; There is no need of that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes

<P>later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if

<P>for his life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come.

<P>On the way get these things.&nbsp; I'll put them down, they'll be needed

<P>and I must go prepared for nursing.&nbsp; Hospital stores are not always

<P>good.&nbsp; Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of
old

<P>wine.&nbsp; I'm not too proud to beg for Father.&nbsp; He shall have
the best

<P>of everything.&nbsp; Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and

<P>Meg, come and help me find my things, for I'm half bewildered."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder

<P>the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room

<P>for a little while, and let them work.&nbsp; Everyone scattered

<P>like leaves before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household

<P>was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every

<P>comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and

<P>friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother's

<P>absence, which comforted her very much.&nbsp; There was nothing he didn't

<P>offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as escort.&nbsp; But the

<P>last was impossible.&nbsp; Mrs. March would not hear of the old

<P>gentleman's undertaking the long journey, yet an expression of relief
was

<P>visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for traveling.

<P>He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and

<P>marched abruptly away, saying he'd be back directly.&nbsp; No one had

<P>time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with

<P>a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she

<P>came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March," he said, in the

<P>kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed

<P>spirit.&nbsp; "I came to offer myself as escort to your mother.&nbsp;
Mr.

<P>Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me

<P>real satisfaction to be of service to her there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following,

<P>as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr.

<P>Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than

<P>the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How kind you all are!&nbsp; Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it

<P>will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of

<P>her.&nbsp; Thank you very, very much!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something

<P>in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the

<P>cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would

<P>call her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a

<P>note from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines

<P>repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told

<P>them it was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted

<P>that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her

<P>advice the next time.&nbsp; Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the

<P>money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her

<P>lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she

<P>had been there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The short afternoon wore away.&nbsp; All other errands were done,

<P>and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while

<P>Beth and Amy goth tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what

<P>she called a `slap and a bang', but still Jo did not come.&nbsp; They

<P>began to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one

<P>knew what freak Jo might take into her head.&nbsp; He missed her,

<P>however, and she came walking in with a very queer expression of

<P>countenance, for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction

<P>and regret in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll

<P>of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in

<P>her voice, "That's my contribution toward making Father comfortable

<P>and bringing him home!"

<P>"My dear, where did you get it?&nbsp; Twenty-five dollars!&nbsp; Jo,
I

<P>hope you haven't done anything rash?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it's mine honestly.&nbsp; I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it.&nbsp;
I

<P>earned it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what

<P>was my own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose,

<P>for all her abundant hair was cut short.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your hair!&nbsp; Your beautiful hair!"&nbsp; "Oh, Jo, how could you?
Your

<P>one beauty."&nbsp; "My dear girl, there was no need of this."&nbsp;
"She doesn't

<P>look like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly,

<P>Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,

<P>and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked

<P>it, "It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth.&nbsp;
It

<P>will be good for my vanity, I getting too proud of my wig.&nbsp; It
will do

<P>my brains good to have that mop taken off.&nbsp; My head feels deliciously

<P>light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop,

<P>which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.&nbsp; I'm
satisfied,

<P>so please take the money and let's have supper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me all about it, Jo.&nbsp; I am not quite satisfied, but I can't

<P>blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as

<P>you call it, to your love.&nbsp; But, my dear, it was not necessary,
and

<P>I'm afraid you will regret it one of these days," said Mrs. March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I won't!" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that

<P>her prank was not entirely condemned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What made you do it?" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought

<P>of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I was wild to to something for Father," replied Jo, as

<P>they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even

<P>in the midst of trouble.&nbsp; "I hate to borrow as much as Mother does,

<P>and I knew Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for

<P>a ninepence.&nbsp; Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent,
and

<P>I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound

<P>to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and

<P>got the simplest with your own hard earnings," said Mrs. March with
a

<P>look that warmed Jo's heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I

<P>went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd

<P>like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.&nbsp; In
a

<P>barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one

<P>black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.&nbsp; It came to
me

<P>all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and

<P>without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair,

<P>and what they would give for mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't see how you dared to do it," said Beth in a tone of awe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil

<P>his hair.&nbsp; He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having

<P>girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.&nbsp; He said
he

<P>didn't care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never

<P>paid much for it in the first place.&nbsp; The work he put it into it
made

<P>it dear, and so on.&nbsp; It was getting late, and I was afraid if it

<P>wasn't done right away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you

<P>know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give it up.&nbsp; So I begged

<P>him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry.&nbsp; It was

<P>silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited,

<P>and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and

<P>said so kindly, `Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady.&nbsp; I'd
do

<P>as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who was Jimmy?" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained

<P>as they went along.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Her son, she said, who was in the army.&nbsp; How friendly such

<P>things make strangers feel, don't they?&nbsp; She talked away all the

<P>time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?" asked

<P>Meg, with a shiver.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things,

<P>and that was the end of it.&nbsp; I never snivel over trifles like that.

<P>I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair

<P>laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head.

<P>It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off.&nbsp; The woman saw me
look

<P>at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep.&nbsp; I'll give it
to

<P>you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so

<P>comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with

<P>a short gray one in her desk.&nbsp; She only said, "Thank you, deary,"

<P>but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and

<P>talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the

<P>prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would have

<P>when Father came home to be nursed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put

<P>by the last finished job, and said, "Come girls."&nbsp; Beth went to
the

<P>piano and played the father's favorite hymn.&nbsp; All began bravely,
but

<P>broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her

<P>heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall

<P>need all the sleep we can get.&nbsp; Good night, my darlings," said
Mrs.

<P>March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the

<P>dear invalid lay in the next room.&nbsp; Beth and Amy soon fell asleep
in

<P>spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most

<P>serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life.&nbsp; Jo lay

<P>motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled

<P>sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo, dear, what is it?&nbsp; Are you crying about father?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, not now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My...My hair!" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother

<P>her emotion in the pillow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed

<P>the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not sorry," protested Jo, with a choke.&nbsp; "I'd do it again

<P>tomorrow, if I could.&nbsp; It's only the vain part of me that goes
and

<P>cries in this silly way.&nbsp; Don't tell anyone, it's all over now.&nbsp;
I

<P>thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my

<P>one beauty.&nbsp; How came you to be awake?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious," said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What did you think of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Handsome faces--eyes particularly," answered Meg, smiling to

<P>herself in the dark.

<P>"What color do you like best?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Brown, that is, sometimes.&nbsp; Blue are lovely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo, laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then

<P>amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of

<P>living in her castle in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still

<P>as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,

<P>settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each

<P>unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to

<P>pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter.&nbsp; As she lifted
the

<P>curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly

<P>from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant

<P>face, which seemed to whisper in the silence," Be comforted, dear

<P>soul!&nbsp; There is always light behind the clouds."
