<P>I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting

<P>of the mother and daughters.&nbsp; Such hours are beautiful to live,

<P>but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination

<P>of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine

<P>happiness, and that Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth

<P>woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which

<P>her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother's face.&nbsp; Too weak

<P>to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the

<P>loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was

<P>satisfied at last.&nbsp; Then she slept again, and the girls waited
upon

<P>their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which

<P>clung to hers even in sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hannah had `dished up' and astonishing breakfast for the

<P>traveler, finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any

<P>other way, and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young

<P>storks, while they listened to her whispered account of Father's

<P>state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays

<P>which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the

<P>unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she

<P>arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What a strange yet pleasant day that was.&nbsp; So brilliant and

<P>gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first

<P>snow.&nbsp; So quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent

<P>with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house,

<P>while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door.&nbsp; With a blissful

<P>sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes,

<P>and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a

<P>quiet harbor.&nbsp; Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side, but rested

<P>in the big chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over

<P>her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his

<P>story so well that Aunt March actually `sniffed' herself, and

<P>never once said "I told you so".&nbsp; Amy came out so strong on

<P>this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel

<P>really began to bear fruit.&nbsp; She dried her tears quickly,

<P>restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought

<P>of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie's

<P>opinion, that she behaved `like a capital little woman'.&nbsp; Even

<P>Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl, blessed

<P>her buttons, and begged her to "come and take a walk, dear", in

<P>his most affable tone.&nbsp; She would very gladly have gone out to

<P>enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie

<P>was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal

<P>the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote

<P>a note to her mother.&nbsp; She was a long time about it, and when she

<P>returned, he was stretched out with both arms under his head,

<P>sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and

<P>sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake

<P>up till night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been

<P>effectually roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother.

<P>There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about

<P>the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the

<P>happiest of all, when she sat in her mother's lap and told her

<P>trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of

<P>approving smiles and fond caresses.&nbsp; They were alone together

<P>in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its

<P>purpose was explained to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear," looking from

<P>the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely

<P>picture with its garland of evergreen.&nbsp; "It is an excellent plan

<P>to have some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex

<P>or grieve us.&nbsp; There are a good many hard times in this life of

<P>ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right

<P>way.&nbsp; I think my little girl is learning this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner

<P>in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture

<P>which I've tried to make.&nbsp; The woman's face is not good, it's

<P>too beautiful for me to draw, but the baby is done better, and

<P>I love it very much.&nbsp; I like to think He was a little child once,

<P>for then I don't seem so far away, and that helps me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's

<P>knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her

<P>smile.&nbsp; She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after

<P>a minute's pause, she added gravely, "I wanted to speak to you

<P>about this, but I forgot it.&nbsp; Aunt gave me the ring today.&nbsp;
She

<P>called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and

<P>said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me always.

<P>She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too

<P>big.&nbsp; I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young

<P>for such ornaments, Amy," said Mrs. March, looking at the plump

<P>little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger,

<P>and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped

<P>together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try not to be vain," said Amy.&nbsp; "I don't think I like

<P>it only because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl

<P>in the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of something."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you mean Aunt March?" asked her mother, laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, to remind me not to be selfish."&nbsp; Amy looked so

<P>earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing,

<P>and listened respectfully to the little plan.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've thought a great deal lately about my `bundle of

<P>naughties', and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm

<P>going to try hard to cure it, if I can.&nbsp; Beth isn't selfish, and

<P>that's the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the

<P>thoughts of losing her.&nbsp; People wouldn't feel so bat about me

<P>if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them, but I'd like

<P>to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm going

<P>to try and be like Beth all I can.&nbsp; I'm apt to forget my

<P>resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me,

<P>I guess I should do better.&nbsp; May we try this way?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet.

<P>Wear your ring, dear, and do your best.&nbsp; I think you will prosper,

<P>for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle.&nbsp; Now I must

<P>go back to Beth.&nbsp; Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will

<P>soon have you home again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report

<P>the traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room,

<P>and finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting

<P>her fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided

<P>look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is it, deary?' asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand,

<P>with a face which invited confidence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want to tell you something, Mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"About Meg?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How quickly you guessed!&nbsp; Yes, it's about her, and though

<P>it's a little thing, it fidgets me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Beth is asleep.&nbsp; Speak low, and tell me all about it.&nbsp; That

<P>Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No.&nbsp; I should have shut the door in his face if he had,"

<P>said Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet.&nbsp; "Last

<P>summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only

<P>one was returned.&nbsp; We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that
Mr.

<P>Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so

<P>young and he so poor.&nbsp; Now, isn't it a dreadful state of things?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think Meg cares for him?" asked Mrs. March, with an

<P>anxious look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy me!&nbsp; I don't know anything about love and such

<P>nonsense!" cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt.

<P>"In novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting

<P>away, growing thin, and acting like fools.&nbsp; Now Meg does not do

<P>anything of the sort.&nbsp; She eats and drinks and sleeps like a

<P>sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk

<P>about that man, and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes

<P>about lovers.&nbsp; I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me as

<P>he ought."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who?" cried Jo, staring.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Brooke.&nbsp; I call him `John' now.&nbsp; We fell into the way

<P>of doing so at the hospital, and he likes it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear!&nbsp; I know you'll take his part.&nbsp; He's been good to

<P>Father, and you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if

<P>she wants to.&nbsp; Mean thing!&nbsp; To go petting Papa and helping
you,

<P>just to wheedle you into liking him." And Jo pulled her hair

<P>again with a wrathful tweak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how

<P>it happened.&nbsp; John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and

<P>was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond

<P>of him.&nbsp; He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he

<P>told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before

<P>he asked her to marry him.&nbsp; He only wanted our leave to love her

<P>and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could.

<P>He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to

<P>listen to him, but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself

<P>so young."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course not.&nbsp; It would be idiotic!&nbsp; I knew there was

<P>mischief brewing.&nbsp; I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined.

<P>I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the

<P>family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said

<P>gravely, "Jo, I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything

<P>to Meg yet.&nbsp; When John comes back, and I see them together, I can

<P>judge better of her feelings toward him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She'll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and

<P>then it will be all up with her.&nbsp; She's got such a soft heart,

<P>it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly

<P>at her.&nbsp; She read the short reports he sent more than she did

<P>your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown

<P>eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly name, and she'll go and fall

<P>in love, and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together.

<P>I see it all!&nbsp; They'll go lovering around the house, and we shall

<P>have to dodge.&nbsp; Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more.

<P>Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,

<P>and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and

<P>everything will be abominably uncomfortable.&nbsp; Oh, dear me!&nbsp;
Why

<P>weren't we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude

<P>and shook her fist at the reprehensible John.&nbsp; Mrs. March sighed,

<P>and Jo looked up with an air of relief.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't like it, Mother?&nbsp; I'm glad of it.&nbsp; Let's send him

<P>about his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be

<P>happy together as we always have been."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did wrong to sigh, Jo.&nbsp; It is natural and right you should

<P>all go to homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls

<P>as long as I can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for

<P>Meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can

<P>make a home for her.&nbsp; Your father and I have agreed that she shall

<P>not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty.&nbsp; If

<P>she and John love one another, they can wait, and test the love

<P>by doing so.&nbsp; She is conscientious, and I have no fear of her

<P>treating him unkindly.&nbsp; My pretty, tender hearted girl!&nbsp; I
hope

<P>things will go happily with her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?" asked Jo, as

<P>her mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls

<P>will never feel the need of it too bitterly not be tempted by

<P>too much.&nbsp; I should like to know that John was firmly established

<P>in some good business, which gave him an income large enough to

<P>keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable.&nbsp; I'm not ambitious

<P>for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name

<P>for my girls.&nbsp; If rank and money come with love and virtue, also,

<P>I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune, but

<P>I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in

<P>a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and some

<P>privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.&nbsp; I am content to

<P>see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich

<P>in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than

<P>a fortune."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed

<P>about Meg, for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and

<P>sit in the lap of luxury all her days.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be nice?"

<P>asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is younger than she, you know," began Mrs. March, but Jo

<P>broke in...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be

<P>quite grown-up in his manners if he likes.&nbsp; Then he's rich and

<P>generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my

<P>plan is spoiled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and

<P>altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to

<P>depend on.&nbsp; Don't make plans, Jo, but let time and their own

<P>hearts mate your friends.&nbsp; We can't meddle safely in such

<P>matters, and had better not get `romantic rubbish' as you

<P>call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross

<P>and getting snarled up, when a pull her and a snip there

<P>would straighten it out.&nbsp; I wish wearing flatirons on our heads

<P>would keep us from growing up.&nbsp; But buds will be roses, and

<P>kittens cats, more's the pity!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's that about flatirons and cats?" asked Meg, as she

<P>crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only one of my stupid speeches.&nbsp; I'm going to bed.&nbsp; Come,

<P>Peggy," said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite right, and beautifully written.&nbsp; Please add that I

<P>send my love to John," said Mrs. March, as she glanced over

<P>the letter and gave it back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you call him `John'?" asked Meg, smiling, with her

<P>innocent eyes looking down into her mother's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,"

<P>replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely.&nbsp; Good night, Mother,

<P>dear.&nbsp; It is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,"

<P>was Meg's answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and

<P>as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction

<P>and regret, "She does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.
