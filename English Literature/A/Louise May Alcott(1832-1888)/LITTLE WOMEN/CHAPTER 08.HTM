<P>"Girls, where are you going?" asked Amy, coming into their

<P>room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to

<P>go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never mind.&nbsp; Little girls shouldn't ask questions," returned

<P>Jo sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we

<P>are young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to "run away,

<P>dear" is still more trying to us.&nbsp; Amy bridled up at this insult,

<P>and determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour.

<P>Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said

<P>coaxingly, "Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, too,

<P>for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven't got anything to

<P>do, and am so lonely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited," began Meg, but

<P>Jo broke in impatiently, "Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it

<P>all.&nbsp; You can't go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.&nbsp; You

<P>were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and

<P>you stopped when I came in.&nbsp; Aren't you going with him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, we are.&nbsp; Now do be still, and stop bothering."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a

<P>fan into her pocket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; You're going to the theater to see the

<P>SEVEN CASTLES!" she cried, adding resolutely, "and I shall go,

<P>for Mother said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and

<P>it was mean not to tell me in time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child," said Meg

<P>soothingly.&nbsp; "Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because

<P>your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this

<P>fairy piece.&nbsp; Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and

<P>have a nice time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie.

<P>Please let me.&nbsp; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut

<P>up, I'm dying for some fun.&nbsp; Do, Meg!&nbsp; I'll be ever so good,"

<P>pleaded Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suppose we take her.&nbsp; I don't believe Mother would mind,

<P>if we bundle her up well," began Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it,

<P>and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and

<P>drag in Amy.&nbsp; I should think she'd hate to poke herself where

<P>she isn't wanted," said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble

<P>of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots

<P>on, saying, in her most aggravating way, "I shall go.&nbsp; Meg says
I

<P>may, and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you

<P>mustn't sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that

<P>will spoil our pleasure.&nbsp; Or he'll get another seat for you, and

<P>that isn't proper when you weren't asked.&nbsp; You shan't stir a

<P>step, so you may just stay where you are," scolded Jo, crosser

<P>than ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry

<P>and Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and

<P>the two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.&nbsp; For

<P>now and then she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a

<P>spoiled child.&nbsp; Just as the party was setting out, Amy called

<P>over the banisters in a threatening tone, "You'll be sorry for

<P>this, Jo March, see if you ain't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fiddlesticks!" returned Jo, slamming the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had a charming time, for THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE

<P>DIAMOND LAKE was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish.

<P>But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the

<P>gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of

<P>bitterness in it.&nbsp; The fairy queen's yellow curls reminded her

<P>of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering

<P>what her sister would do to make her `sorry for it'.&nbsp; She and

<P>Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives,

<P>for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly

<P>roused.&nbsp; Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional

<P>explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward.

<P>Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard

<P>times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting

<P>her into trouble.&nbsp; Her anger never lasted long, and having humbly

<P>confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do better.

<P>Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a

<P>fury because she was such an angel afterward.&nbsp; Poor Jo tried

<P>desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to

<P>flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to

<P>subdue it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they got home, they found amy reading in the parlor.

<P>She assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes

<P>from her book, or asked a single question.&nbsp; Perhaps curiosity

<P>might have conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there to

<P>inquire and receive a glowing description of the play.&nbsp; On going

<P>up to put away her best hat, Jo's first look was toward the

<P>bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had soothed her feelings

<P>by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the floor.&nbsp; Everything

<P>was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance into her

<P>various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had

<P>forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery

<P>which produced a tempest.&nbsp; Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together,

<P>late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited

<P>and demanding breathlessly, "Has anyone taken my book?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg and Beth said, "No." at once, and looked surprised.&nbsp; Amy

<P>poked the fire and said nothing.&nbsp; Jo saw her color rise and was

<P>down upon her in a minute.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Amy, you've got it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I haven't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know where it is, then!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I don't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's a fib!" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and

<P>looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It isn't.&nbsp; I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and

<P>don't care."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once,

<P>or I'll make you."&nbsp; And Jo gave her a slight shake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old

<P>book again," cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"why not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I burned it up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!&nbsp; My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and

<P>meant to finish before Father got home?&nbsp; Have you really burned
it?"

<P>said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands

<P>clutched Amy nervously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I did!&nbsp; I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross

<P>yesterday, and I have, so..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and

<P>she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a

<P>passion of grief and anger...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You wicked, wicked girl!&nbsp; I never can write it again, and

<P>I'll never forgive you as long as I live."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was

<P>quite beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear,

<P>she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and

<P>finished her fight alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and,

<P>having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong

<P>she had done her sister.&nbsp; Jo's book was the pride of her heart,

<P>and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great

<P>promise.&nbsp; It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo

<P>had worked over them patiently, putting her whole heart into

<P>her work, hoping to make something good enough to print.&nbsp; She

<P>had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the old

<P>manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work

<P>of several years.&nbsp; It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo

<P>it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be

<P>made up to her.&nbsp; Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg

<P>refused to defend her pet.&nbsp; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved,

<P>and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon

<P>for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and

<P>unapproachable that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please forgive me, Jo.&nbsp; I'm very, very sorry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never shall forgive you," was Jo's stern answer, and

<P>from that moment she ignored Amy entirely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for

<P>all had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words

<P>were wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little

<P>accident, or her own generous nature, softened Jo's resentment

<P>and healed the breach.&nbsp; It was not a happy evening, for though

<P>they sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer,

<P>Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and the sweet home

<P>peace was disturbed.&nbsp; They felt this most when singing time came,

<P>for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke

<P>down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.&nbsp; But in spite of their efforts

<P>to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem to

<P>chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,

<P>"My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger.&nbsp; Forgive each

<P>other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and

<P>cry her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly

<P>weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't

<P>quite forgive yet.&nbsp; So she winked hard, shook her head, and said

<P>gruffly because Amy was listening, "It was an abominable thing,

<P>and she doesn't deserve to be forgiven."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry

<P>or confidential gossip that night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been

<P>repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel

<P>more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior

<P>virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating.&nbsp; Jo still

<P>looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day.&nbsp; It

<P>was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover

<P>in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets, Meg was

<P>sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home,

<P>and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking

<P>about being good and yet wouldn't even try when other people set

<P>them a virtuous example.

<P>"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating.&nbsp; He

<P>is always kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know," said

<P>Jo to herself, and off she went.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient

<P>exclamation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There!&nbsp; She promised I should go next time, for this is the

<P>last ice we shall have.&nbsp; But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch

<P>to take me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't say that.&nbsp; You were very naughty, and it is hard to

<P>forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she

<P>might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the

<P>right minute," said Meg.&nbsp; "Go after them.&nbsp; Don't say anything
till

<P>Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and

<P>just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I'm sure she'll be

<P>friends again with all her heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try," said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a

<P>flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just

<P>disappearing over the hill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy

<P>reached them.&nbsp; Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.&nbsp; Laurie
did

<P>not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the

<P>ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before

<P>we begin to race," Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like

<P>a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and

<P>blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo

<P>never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a

<P>bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister's troubles.

<P>She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession

<P>of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at

<P>once.&nbsp; As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Keep near the shore.&nbsp; It isn't safe in the middle."

<P>Jo heard, but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch

<P>a word.&nbsp; Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she
was

<P>harboring said in her ear...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of

<P>herself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn,

<P>and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the the smoother ice in

<P>the middle of the river.&nbsp; For a minute Jo stood still with a

<P>strange feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but

<P>something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw

<P>up her hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the

<P>splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart stand still with

<P>fear.&nbsp; She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone.&nbsp;
She tried

<P>to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them,

<P>and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a

<P>terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water.

<P>Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bring a rail.&nbsp; Quick, quick!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes

<P>she worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite

<P>self-possessed, and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey

<P>stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they

<P>got the child out, more frightened than hurt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.&nbsp; Pile our

<P>things on her, while I get off these confounded skates," cried

<P>Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps

<P>which never seemed so intricate before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after

<P>an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before

<P>a hot fire.&nbsp; During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown

<P>about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn,

<P>and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles.

<P>When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet,&nbsp; and Mrs. March
sitting

<P>by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you sure she is safe?" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully

<P>at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight

<P>forever under the treacherous ice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite safe, dear.&nbsp; she is not hurt, and won't even take cold,

<P>I think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home

<P>quickly," replied her mother cheerfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie did it all.&nbsp; I only let her go.&nbsp; Mother, if she should

<P>die, it would be my fault."&nbsp; And Jo dropped down beside the bed
in

<P>a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly

<P>condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for

<P>being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.

<P>"It's my dreadful temper!&nbsp; I try to cure it, I think I have,

<P>and then it breaks out worse than ever.&nbsp; OH, Mother, what shall
I

<P>do?&nbsp; What shall I do?" cried poor Jo, in despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never

<P>think it is impossible to conquer your fault," said Mrs. March,

<P>drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek

<P>so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is!&nbsp; It seems as

<P>if I could do anything when I'm in a passion.&nbsp; I get so savage,
I

<P>could hurt anyone and enjoy it.&nbsp; I'm afraid I shall do something

<P>dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me.

<P>Oh, Mother, help me, do help me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will, my child, I will.&nbsp; Don't cry so bitterly, but remember

<P>this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know

<P>another like it.&nbsp; Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far

<P>greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer

<P>them.&nbsp; You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine

<P>used to be just like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yours, Mother?&nbsp; Why, you are never angry!"&nbsp; And for the

<P>moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only

<P>succeeded in controlling it.&nbsp; I am angry nearly every day of my

<P>life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to

<P>learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years

<P>to do so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well

<P>was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest

<P>reproof.&nbsp; She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence

<P>given her.&nbsp; The knowledge that her mother had a fault like

<P>hers, and tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and

<P>strengthened her resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed

<P>rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together

<P>and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people

<P>worry you?" asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother

<P>than ever before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my

<P>lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will,

<P>I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for

<P>being so weak and wicked," answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a

<P>smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How did you learn to keep still?&nbsp; That is what troubles me,

<P>for the sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the

<P>more I say the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's

<P>feelings and say dreadful things.&nbsp; Tell me how you do it, Marmee

<P>dear."

<P>"My good mother used to help me..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As you do us..." interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and

<P>for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess

<P>my weakness to anyone else.&nbsp; I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a
good

<P>many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I

<P>never seemed to get on.&nbsp; Then your father came, and I was so happy

<P>that i found it easy to be good.&nbsp; But by-and-by, when I had four

<P>little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble

<P>began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very

<P>much to see my children wanting anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Mother!&nbsp; What helped you then?"
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your father, Jo.&nbsp; He never loses patience, never doubts or

<P>complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully

<P>that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him.&nbsp; He helped and

<P>comforted me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the

<P>virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was their

<P>example.&nbsp; It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own.

<P>A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply

<P>rebuked me more than any words could have done, and the love,

<P>respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I

<P>could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them

<P>copy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be

<P>satisfied," cried Jo, much touched.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must

<P>keep watch over your `bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it

<P>may sadden, if not spoil your life.&nbsp; You have had a warning.

<P>Remember it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick

<P>temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you

<P>have known today."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will try, Mother, I truly will.&nbsp; But you must help me,

<P>remind me, and keep me from flying out.&nbsp; I used to see Father

<P>sometimes put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a

<P>very kind but sober face, and you always folded your lips tight

<P>and went away.&nbsp; Was he reminding you then?" asked Jo softly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it,

<P>but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture

<P>and kind look."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled

<P>as she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she

<P>whispered anxiously, "Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of

<P>it?&nbsp; I didn't mean to be rude, but it's so comfortable to say all

<P>I think to you, and feel so safe and happy here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mu Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my

<P>greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me

<P>and know how much I love them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought I'd grieved you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I

<P>miss him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch

<P>and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he

<P>went, and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,"

<P>said Jo, wondering.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears

<P>till he was gone.&nbsp; Why should I complain, when we both have

<P>merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in

<P>the end?&nbsp; If I don't seem to need help, it is because I have a

<P>better friend, even than Father, to comfort and sustain me.&nbsp; My

<P>child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning

<P>and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if

<P>you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly

<P>Father as you do that of your earthly one.&nbsp; The more you love

<P>and trust Him, and the less you will depend on human power and

<P>wisdom.&nbsp; His love and care never tire or change, can never be

<P>taken from you, but my become the source of lifelong peace,

<P>happiness, and strength.&nbsp; Believe this heartily, and go to God

<P>with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as

<P>freely and confidingly as you come to your mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the

<P>silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed

<P>left her heart without words.&nbsp; For in that sad yet happy hour,

<P>she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair,

<P>but the sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by

<P>her mother's hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always

<P>welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father,

<P>tenderer than that of any mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin

<P>at once to mend her fault, l Jo looked up with an expression on her

<P>face which it had never worn before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I let the sun go down on my anger.&nbsp; I wouldn't forgive her,

<P>and today, if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too

<P>late!&nbsp; How could I be so wicked?" said Jo, half aloud, as she

<P>leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on

<P>the pillow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms,

<P>with a smile that went straight to Jo's heart.&nbsp; Neither said a

<P>word, but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets,

<P>and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.
