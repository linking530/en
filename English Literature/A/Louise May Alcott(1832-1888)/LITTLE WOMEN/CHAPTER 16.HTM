<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read

<P>their chapter with an earnestness never felt before.&nbsp; For now

<P>the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full

<P>of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye

<P>cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious

<P>journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them.&nbsp; Everything

<P>seemed very strange when they went down, so dim and still outside,

<P>so full of light and bustle within.&nbsp; Breakfast at that early hour

<P>seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she

<P>flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on.&nbsp; The big trunk stood

<P>ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and

<P>Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn

<P>with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard

<P>to keep their resolution.&nbsp; Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of

<P>herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller

<P>more than once, ant the little girls wore a grave, troubled

<P>expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they

<P>sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who

<P>were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing

<P>out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes,

<P>and a forth fastening up her travelling bag...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's

<P>protection.&nbsp; Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor

<P>will guard you as if you were his own.&nbsp; I have no fears for you,

<P>yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly.&nbsp; Don't

<P>grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and

<P>comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget.&nbsp; Go on with

<P>your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace.&nbsp; Hope and keep
busy,

<P>and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult

<P>Hannah, and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence.&nbsp; Be patient,
Jo,

<P>don't get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be

<P>my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all.&nbsp; Beth, comfort yourself

<P>with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and You

<P>Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We will, Mother!&nbsp; We will!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and

<P>listen.&nbsp; That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well.&nbsp;
No

<P>one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their

<P>hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father,

<P>remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them.

<P>They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and

<P>tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr.

<P>Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls

<P>christened him `Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Goodby, my darlings!&nbsp; God bless and keep us all!" whispered

<P>Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other,

<P>and hurried into the carriage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she

<P>saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen.&nbsp; They

<P>saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing

<P>she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and

<P>behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah,

<P>and devoted Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How kind everyone is to us!" she said, turning to find fresh

<P>proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't see how they can help it," returned Mr. Brooke,

<P>laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling.

<P>And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles,

<P>and cheerful words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I feel as if there had been an earthquake," said Jo, as their

<P>neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh

<P>themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It seems as if half the house was gone," added Meg forlornly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to

<P>the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing

<P>that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked

<P>for them.&nbsp; It was a little thing, but it went straight to their

<P>hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke

<P>down and cried bitterly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and

<P>when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the

<P>rescue, armed with a coffeepot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, ny dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and

<P>don't fret.&nbsp; Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then

<P>let's fall to work and be a credit to the family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it

<P>that morning.&nbsp; No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the

<P>fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot.&nbsp; They

<P>drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins,

<P>and in ten minutes were all right again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see

<P>who will remember it best.&nbsp; I shall go to Aunt March, as usual.

<P>Oh, won't she lecture though!" said Jo, as she sipped with

<P>returning spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home

<P>and attend to things here," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her

<P>eyes so red.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No need of that.&nbsp; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,"

<P>put in Amy, with an important air.

<P>"Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything

<P>nice when you come home," added Beth, getting out her mop and dish

<P>tub without delay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think anxiety is very interesting," observed Amy, eating

<P>sugar pensively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it,

<P>though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find

<P>consolation in a sugar bowl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again, and when the

<P>two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back

<P>at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother's

<P>face.&nbsp; It was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household

<P>ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a

<P>rosyfaced mandarin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's so like my Beth!" said Jo, waving her hat, with a

<P>grateful face.&nbsp; "Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain

<P>today.&nbsp; Don't fret about Father, dear," she added, as they parted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I hope Aunt March won't croak.&nbsp; Your hair is becoming,

<P>and it looks very boyish and nice," returned Meg, trying not to

<P>smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall

<P>sister's shoulders.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's my only comfort." And, touching her hat a` la Laurie,

<P>away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>News from their father comforted the girls very much, for

<P>though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of

<P>nurses had already done him good.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every

<P>day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the

<P>dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed.&nbsp; At first,

<P>everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully

<P>poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt

<P>rather important with their Washington correspondence.&nbsp; As one
of

<P>these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will

<P>rob an imaginary mail, and read them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My dearest Mother:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made

<P>us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying

<P>over it.&nbsp; How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr.

<P>Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he is so

<P>useful to you and Father.&nbsp; The girls are all as good as gold.&nbsp;
Jo

<P>helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard

<P>jobs.&nbsp; I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her

<P>`moral fit' wouldn't last long.&nbsp; Beth is as regular about her tasks

<P>as a clock, and never forgets what you told her.&nbsp; She grieves about

<P>Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano.&nbsp;
Amy

<P>minds me nicely, and I take great care of her.&nbsp; She does her own

<P>hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings.

<P>She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her

<P>improvement when you come.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence watches over us like a

<P>motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly.

<P>He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel

<P>like orphans, with you so far away.&nbsp; Hannah is a perfect saint.&nbsp;
She

<P>does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is

<P>quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect.&nbsp; We are all

<P>well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back.&nbsp; Give

<P>my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MEG
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great

<P>contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin

<P>foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes

<P>and curly-tailed letters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My precious Marmee:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Three cheers for dear Father!&nbsp; Brooke was a trump to telegraph

<P>right off, and let us know the minute he was better.&nbsp; I rushed
up

<P>garret when the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so

<P>good to us, but I could only cry, and say, "I'm glad!&nbsp; I'm glad!"

<P>Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer?&nbsp; For I felt a great

<P>many in my heart.&nbsp; We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy

<P>them, for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living in a

<P>nest of turtledoves.&nbsp; You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and

<P>try to be motherish.&nbsp; She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love

<P>with her sometimes.&nbsp; The children are regular archangels, and I--

<P>well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else.&nbsp; Oh, I must tell

<P>you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie.&nbsp; I freed my
mind

<P>about a silly little thing, and he was offended.&nbsp; I was right,
but

<P>didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't

<P>come again till I begged pardon.&nbsp; I declared I wouldn't and got
mad.

<P>It lasted all day.&nbsp; I felt bad and wanted you very much.&nbsp;
Laurie and

<P>I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon.&nbsp; But I thought he'd

<P>come to it, for I was in the right.&nbsp; He didn't come, and just at

<P>night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.&nbsp;
I

<P>read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set

<P>on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry.&nbsp; I met him

<P>at the gate, coming for the same thing.&nbsp; We both laughed, begged

<P>each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I made a `pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash,

<P>and as Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse

<P>him.&nbsp; Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself

<P>a dozen times for your...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>TOPSY-TURVY JO
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A SONG FROM THE SUDS
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,

<P>While the white foam rises high,

<P>And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,

<P>And fasten the clothes to dry.

<P>Then out in the free fresh air they swing,

<P>Under the sunny sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I wish we could wash from out hearts and souls

<P>The stains of the week away,

<P>And let water and air by their magic make

<P>Ourselves as pure as they.

<P>Then on the earth there would be indeed,

<P>A glorious washing day!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Along the path of a useful life,

<P>Will heartsease ever bloom.

<P>The busy mind has no time to think

<P>Of sorrow or care or gloom.

<P>And anxious thoughts may be swept away,

<P>As we bravely wield a broom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I am glad a task to me is given,

<P>To labor at day by day,

<P>For it brings me health and strength and hope,

<P>And I cheerfully learn to say,

<P>"Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,

<P>But, Hand, you shall work alway!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear Mother,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed

<P>pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for

<P>Father to see.&nbsp; I read every morning, try to be good all day, and

<P>sing myself to sleep with Father's tune.&nbsp; I can't sing `LAND OF

<P>THE LEAL' now, it makes me cry.&nbsp; Everyone is very kind, and we
are

<P>as happy as we can be without you.&nbsp; Amy wants the rest of the page,

<P>so I must stop.&nbsp; I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I wind

<P>the clock and air the rooms every day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine.&nbsp; Oh, do come soon

<P>to your loving .&nbsp; ..

<P>We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate

<P>the girls--Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and

<P>you can take the properest.&nbsp; Meg is a great comfort to me and lets

<P>me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because

<P>it keeps me sweet tempered.&nbsp; Laurie is not as respeckful as he
ought

<P>to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my

<P>feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon

<P>jour as Hattie King does.&nbsp; The sleeves of my blue dress were all

<P>worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong

<P>and they are more blue than the dress.&nbsp; I felt bad but did not
fret

<P>I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch

<P>in my aprons and have buckwheats every day.&nbsp; Can't she?&nbsp; Didn't
I

<P>make that interrigation point nice?&nbsp; Meg says my punchtuation and

<P>spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so
