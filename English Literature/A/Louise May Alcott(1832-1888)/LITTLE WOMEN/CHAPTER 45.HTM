<P>I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian

<P>of the March family, without devoting at least one chapter to

<P>the two most precious and important members of it.&nbsp; Daisy and

<P>Demi had now arrived at years of discretion, for in this fast

<P>age babies of three or four assert their rights, and get them,

<P>too, which is more than many of their elders do.&nbsp; If there

<P>ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled

<P>by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes.&nbsp; Of course they

<P>were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be shown

<P>when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently

<P>at twelve months, and at two years they took their places

<P>at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders.

<P>At three, Daisy demanded a `needler', and actually made

<P>a bag with four stitches in it.&nbsp; She likewise set up

<P>housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking

<P>stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's

<P>eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who

<P>invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters

<P>with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and

<P>heels.&nbsp; The boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted

<P>his father and distracted his mother, for he tried to

<P>imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic

<P>condition, with his `sewinsheen', a mysterious structure of

<P>string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go

<P>`wound and wound'.&nbsp; Also a basket hung over the back of a chair,

<P>in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who,

<P>with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till

<P>rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, "Why,

<P>Marmar, dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably

<P>well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice

<P>a day.&nbsp; Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly

<P>defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a

<P>galley slave of herself, and adored her brother as the one perfect

<P>being in the world.&nbsp; A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul

<P>was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and nestled

<P>there.&nbsp; One of the captivating children, who seem made to be

<P>kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses,

<P>and produced for general approval on all festive occasions.

<P>Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite

<P>angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully

<P>human.&nbsp; It was all fair weather in her world, and every

<P>morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown

<P>to look our, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone,

<P>"Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" Everyone was a friend, and she

<P>offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate

<P>bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful

<P>worshipers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me loves evvybody," she once said, opening her arms, with

<P>her spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to

<P>embrace and nourish the whole world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote

<P>would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving

<P>as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to

<P>pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately

<P>taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares.&nbsp; Her

<P>grandfather often called her `Beth', and her grandmother watched

<P>over her with untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some

<P>past mistake, which no eye but her own could see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting

<P>to know everything, and often getting much disturbed because he

<P>could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual "What for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of

<P>his grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him,

<P>in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to

<P>the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What makes my legs go, Dranpa?" asked the young philosopher,

<P>surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air,

<P>while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's your little mind, Demi," replied the sage, stroking the

<P>yellow head respectfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is a little mine?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring

<P>made the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Open me.&nbsp; I want to see it go wound."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch.&nbsp; God

<P>winds you up, and you go till He stops you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Does I?" And Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he

<P>took in the new thought.&nbsp; "Is I wounded up like the watch?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of

<P>the watch, and then gravely remarked, "I dess Dod does it when

<P>I's asleep."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively

<P>that his anxious grandmother said, "My dear, do you think it wise

<P>to talk about such things to that baby?&nbsp; He's getting great bumps

<P>over his eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to

<P>receive true answers.&nbsp; I am not putting the thoughts into his

<P>head, but helping him unfold those already there.&nbsp; These children

<P>are wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands

<P>every word I have said to him.&nbsp; Now, Demi, tell me where you keep

<P>your mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, "By the gods, Socrates,

<P>I cannot tell," his grandfather would not have been surprised, but

<P>when, after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young

<P>stork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, "In my little

<P>belly," the old gentleman could only join in Grandma's laugh, and

<P>dismiss the class in metaphysics.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had

<P>not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a

<P>budding philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused

<P>Hannah to prophesy, with ominous nods, "That child ain't long for

<P>this world," he would turn about and set her fears at rest by

<P>some of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals

<P>distract and delight their parent's souls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what

<P>mother was ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious

<P>evasions, or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women

<P>who so early show themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No more raisins, Demi.&nbsp; They'll make you sick," says Mamma

<P>to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with

<P>unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me likes to be sick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit,

<P>and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits

<P>Mamma by a shrewd bargain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you

<P>like," says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when

<P>the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Truly, Marmar?" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered
head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, truly.&nbsp; Anything you say," replies the shortsighted parent,

<P>preparing herself to sing, "The Three Little Kittens" half a

<P>dozen times over, or to take her family to "Buy a penny bun," regardless

<P>of wind or limb.&nbsp; But Demi corners her by the cool reply...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children,

<P>and the trio turned the little house topsy-turvy.&nbsp; Aunt Amy was
as

<P>yet only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly

<P>vague memory, but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the

<P>most of her, for which compliment she was deeply grateful.&nbsp; But

<P>when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and

<P>desolation fell upon their little souls.&nbsp; Daisy, who was fond of

<P>going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became

<P>bankrupt.&nbsp; Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that

<P>Dodo like to play with `the bear-man' better than she did him,

<P>but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn't the

<P>heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in

<P>his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its

<P>case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties

<P>as bribes, but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to

<P>patronize the `the bear-man' with pensive affability, while Daisy

<P>bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call, and

<P>considered his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts

<P>treasures surpassing worth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration

<P>for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard,

<P>but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them,

<P>and does not deceive anybody a particle.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer's devotion
was

<P>sincere, however likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy

<P>in love as in law.&nbsp; He was one of the men who are at home with
children,

<P>and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant

<P>contrast with his manly one.&nbsp; His business, whatever it was, detained

<P>him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to

<P>see--well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the

<P>attraction.&nbsp; The excellent papa labored under the delusion that
he

<P>was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till

<P>a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened
him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the

<P>study, astonished by the spectacle that met his eye.&nbsp; Prone upon

<P>the floor lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and

<P>beside him, likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude

<P>with his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers

<P>so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators,

<P>till Mr. Bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with

<P>a scandalized face...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Father, Father, here's the Professor!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the

<P>preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity, "Good evening, Mr. Bhaer.

<P>Excuse me for a moment.&nbsp; We are just finishing our lesson.&nbsp;
Now, Demi,

<P>make the letter and tell its name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knows him!"&nbsp; And, after a few convulsive efforts, the red

<P>legs tok the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent

<P>pupil triumphantly shouted, "It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's a born Weller," laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself

<P>up, and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only

<P>mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What have you been at today, bubchen?" asked Mr. Bhaer,

<P>picking up the gymnast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me went to see little Mary."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And what did you there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kissed her," began Demi, with artless frankness.

<P>"Prut!&nbsp; Thou beginnest early.&nbsp; What did the little Mary say

<P>to that?" asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner,

<P>who stood upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it.&nbsp; Don't

<P>little boys like little girls?" asked Demi, with his mouth full,

<P>and an air of bland satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You precious chick!&nbsp; Who put that into your head?" said Jo,

<P>enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf," answered literal

<P>Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking

<P>she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend.&nbsp; Sweets to

<P>the sweet, mannling." And Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look

<P>that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the

<P>gods.&nbsp; Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy

<P>inquired.&nbsp; ..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do great boys like great girls, to, 'Fessor?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer `couldn't tell a lie', so

<P>he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes,

<P>in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush,

<P>glance at Jo's retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking

<P>as if the `precocious chick' had put an idea into his head

<P>that was both sweet and sour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an

<P>hour afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body

<P>with a tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there,

<P>and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected

<P>gift of a big slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems

<P>over which Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to

<P>leave unsolved forever.
