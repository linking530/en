<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life

<P>with the determination to be a model housekeeper.&nbsp; John should

<P>find home a paradise, he should always see a smiling face,

<P>should fare sumptuously every day, and never know the loss of

<P>a button.&nbsp; She brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness

<P>to the work that she could not but succeed, in spite of some

<P>obstacles.&nbsp; Her paradise was not a tranquil one, for the little

<P>woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and bustled about like

<P>a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.&nbsp; She was too tired, sometimes,

<P>even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty

<P>dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.&nbsp; As for buttons,

<P>she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over

<P>the carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them

<P>on himself, and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy

<P>fingers any better than hers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were very happy, even after they discovered that they

<P>couldn't live on love alone.&nbsp; John did not find Meg's beauty diminished,

<P>though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.

<P>Nor did Meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her

<P>husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, "Shall I send

<P>some veal or mutton for dinner, darling?" The little house ceased

<P>to be a glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple

<P>soon felt that it was a change for the better.&nbsp; At first they played

<P>keep-house, and frolicked over it like children.&nbsp; Then John took

<P>steadily to business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon

<P>his shoulders, and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron,

<P>and fell to work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's

<P>Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the

<P>problems with patience and care.&nbsp; Sometimes her family were invited

<P>in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would

<P>be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be

<P>concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little

<P>Hummels.&nbsp; An evening with John over the account books usually produced

<P>a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit

<P>would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of

<P>bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul,

<P>although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.&nbsp; Before the golden

<P>mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what

<P>young couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with

<P>homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly.

<P>John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an

<P>extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were

<P>to be attended to at once.&nbsp; As John firmly believed that `my wife'

<P>was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he

<P>resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit

<P>laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use.&nbsp; Home came four

<P>dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small

<P>boy to pick the currants for her.&nbsp; With her pretty hair tucked
into

<P>a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which

<P>had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell

<P>to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn't she seen

<P>Hannah do it hundreds of times?&nbsp; The array of pots rather amazed
her

<P>at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars

<P>would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved to fill them

<P>all, and spend a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing

<P>over her jelly.&nbsp; She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs. Cornelius,

<P>she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that she left

<P>undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful

<P>stuff wouldn't `jell'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her

<P>a hand, but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone

<P>with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.&nbsp; They had

<P>laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most

<P>preposterous one, but they had held to their resolve, and whenever

<P>they could get on without help they did so, and no one interfered,

<P>for Mrs. March had advised the plan.&nbsp; So Meg wrestled alone with
the

<P>refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock

<P>sat down in her topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands,

<P>lifted up her voice and wept.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said,

<P>"My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever

<P>he likes.&nbsp; I shall always be prepared.&nbsp; There shall be no
flurry, no

<P>scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a

<P>good dinner.&nbsp; John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom

<P>you please, and be sure of a welcome from me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How charming that was, to be sure!&nbsp; John quite glowed with

<P>pride to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to

<P>have a superior wife.&nbsp; But, although they had had company from
time

<P>to time, it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had

<P>an opportunity to distinguish herself till now.&nbsp; It always happens

<P>so in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things

<P>which we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would

<P>have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in

<P>the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.&nbsp; Congratulating

<P>himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning,

<P>feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in

<P>pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when

<P>his pretty wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend

<P>to his mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host
and husband.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he

<P>reached the Dovecote.&nbsp; the front door usually stood hospitably
open.

<P>Now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still

<P>adorned the steps.&nbsp; The parlor windows were closed and curtained,

<P>no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with

<P>a distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess,

<P>smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest.&nbsp; Nothing of the
sort,

<P>for not a soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep under the

<P>current bushes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid something has happened.&nbsp; Step into the garden, Scott,

<P>while I look up Mrs. Brooke," said John, alarmed at the silence and

<P>solitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned

<P>sugar, and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his

<P>face.&nbsp; He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared,

<P>but he could both see and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the

<P>prospect mightily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.&nbsp; One edition of

<P>jelly was trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor,

<P>and a third was burning gaily on the stove.&nbsp; Lotty, with Teutonic

<P>phlegm, was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was

<P>still in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron

<P>over her head, sat sobbing dismally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest girl, what is the matter?" cried John, rushing in,

<P>with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and

<P>secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!&nbsp; I've

<P>been at it till I'm all worn out.&nbsp; Do come and help me or I shall

<P>die!" And the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast,

<P>giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her

<P>pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What worries you dear?&nbsp; Has anything dreadful happened?"

<P>asked the anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little

<P>cap, which was all askew.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," sobbed Meg despairingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me quick, then.&nbsp; Don't cry.&nbsp; I can bear anything better

<P>than that.&nbsp; Out with it, love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The...The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward,

<P>and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty

<P>peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is that all?&nbsp; Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any

<P>more about it.&nbsp; I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's

<P>sake don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner,

<P>and..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands

<P>with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone

<P>of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!&nbsp; John Brooke, how

<P>could you do such a thing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hush, he's in the garden!&nbsp; I forgot the confounded jelly, but

<P>it can't be helped now," said John, surveying the prospect with an

<P>anxious eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you

<P>ought to have remembered how busy I was," continued Meg petulantly,

<P>for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send

<P>word, for I met him on the way out.&nbsp; I never thought of asking
leave,

<P>when you have always told me to do as I liked.&nbsp; I never tried it
before,

<P>and hang me if I ever do again!" added John, with an aggrieved air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should hope not!&nbsp; Take him away at once.&nbsp; I can't see him,

<P>and there isn't any dinner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I like that!&nbsp; Where's the beef and vegetables I sent

<P>home, and the pudding you promised?" cried John, rushing to the

<P>larder.

<P>"I hadn't time to cook anything.&nbsp; I meant to dine at Mother's.

<P>I'm sorry, but I was so busy," and Meg's tears began again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's

<P>work to come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic

<P>house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conductive

<P>to repose of mind or manner.&nbsp; He restrained himself however, and
the

<P>little squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand,

<P>we'll pull through and have a good time yet.&nbsp; Don't cry, dear,
but

<P>just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.&nbsp; We're

<P>both as hungry as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.&nbsp; Give
us

<P>the cold meat, and bread and cheese.&nbsp; We won't ask for jelly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed

<P>his fate.&nbsp; Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure,

<P>and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.&nbsp; I'm too

<P>used up to `exert' myself for anyone.&nbsp; It's like a man to propose

<P>a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company.&nbsp; I won't have anything

<P>of the sort in my house.&nbsp; Take that Scott up to Mother's, and

<P>tell him I'm away, sick, dead, anything.&nbsp; I won't see him, and
you

<P>two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like.&nbsp; You won't

<P>have anything else here."&nbsp; And having delivered her defiance all

<P>on one breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the

<P>field to bemoan herself in her own room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew,

<P>but Mr. scott was not taken `up to Mother's', and when Meg descended,

<P>after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous

<P>lunch which filled her with horror.&nbsp; Lotty reported that they had
eaten

<P>"a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all

<P>the sweet stuff, and hide the pots."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own

<P>short comings, of loyalty to John, "who might be cruel, but nobody

<P>should know it," restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up,

<P>she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to

<P>come and be forgiven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that

<P>light.&nbsp; He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused
his

<P>little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably

<P>that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come

<P>again, but John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that

<P>Meg had deserted him in his hour of need.&nbsp; "It wasn't fair to tell

<P>a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when

<P>he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him

<P>in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied.&nbsp; No, by George, it wasn't!

<P>And Meg must know it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was

<P>over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came

<P>over him.&nbsp; "Poor little thing!&nbsp; It was hard upon her when
she tried so

<P>heartily to please me.&nbsp; She was wrong, of course, but then she
was

<P>young.&nbsp; I must be patient and teach her."&nbsp; He hoped she had
not gone

<P>home--he hated gossip and interference.&nbsp; For a minute he was ruffled

<P>again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry

<P>herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,

<P>resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her

<P>where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg likewise resolved to be `calm and kind, but firm', and show

<P>him his duty.&nbsp; She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and
be

<P>kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she

<P>did nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum

<P>quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in

<P>her best parlor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but

<P>feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none,

<P>only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly

<P>relevant remark, "We are going to have a new moon, my dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've no objection," was Meg's equally soothing remark.&nbsp; A few

<P>other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and

<P>wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.&nbsp; John

<P>went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,

<P>figuratively speaking.&nbsp; Meg went to the other window, and sewed
as

<P>if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life.

<P>Neither spoke.&nbsp; Both looked quite `calm and firm', and both felt

<P>desperately uncomfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear," thought Meg, "married life is very trying, and

<P>does need infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says."&nbsp;
The

<P>word `Mother' suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and

<P>received with unbelieving protests.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn

<P>to see and bear with them, remembering your own.&nbsp; He is very decided,

<P>but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.

<P>He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good

<P>trait, though you call him `fussy'.&nbsp; Never deceive him by look
or

<P>word, Meg, and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the

<P>support you need.&nbsp; He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and
then

<P>all over--but the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but

<P>once kindled is hard to quench.&nbsp; Be careful, be very careful, not
to

<P>wake his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on

<P>keeping his respect.&nbsp; Watch yourself, be the first to ask pardon
if

<P>you both err, and guard against the little piques, misunderstandings,

<P>and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,

<P>especially the last.&nbsp; This was the first serious disagreement,
her

<P>own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled

<P>them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John

<P>coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart.&nbsp; She glanced
at

<P>him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them.&nbsp; She put down

<P>her work and got up, thinking, "I will be the first to say,

<P>`Forgive me', but he did not seem to hear her.&nbsp; She went very slowly

<P>across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by him,

<P>but he did not turn his head.&nbsp; For a minute she felt as if she

<P>really couldn't do it, then came the thought, This is the beginning.

<P>I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself with,"

<P>and stooping sown, she softly kissed her husband on the forehead.

<P>Of course that settled it.&nbsp; The penitent kiss was better than a

<P>world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying

<P>tenderly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots.

<P>Forgive me, dear.&nbsp; I never will again!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did

<P>Meg, both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made,

<P>for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation,

<P>and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the

<P>first course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and

<P>made everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he

<P>was a lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood

<P>all the way home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.&nbsp; Sallie

<P>Moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of

<P>gossip at the little house, or inviting `that poor dear' to come in

<P>and spend the day at the big house.&nbsp; It was pleasant, for in dull

<P>weather Meg often felt lonely.&nbsp; All were busy at home, John absent

<P>till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.&nbsp;
So

<P>it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping

<P>with her friend.&nbsp; Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for

<P>such, and pity herself because she had not got them.&nbsp; Sallie was
very

<P>kind, and often offered her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined

<P>them, knowing that John wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little

<P>woman went and did what John disliked even worse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he

<P>trusted her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to

<P>value more--his money.&nbsp; She knew where it was, was free to take
what

<P>she liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every

<P>penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's

<P>wife.&nbsp; Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept
her

<P>little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without

<P>fear.&nbsp; But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and
tempted

<P>her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.&nbsp; Meg

<P>didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.&nbsp; It irritated her,

<P>but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console

<P>herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think

<P>she had to economize.&nbsp; She always felt wicked after it, for the
pretty

<P>things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't

<P>worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in

<P>the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she

<P>cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather

<P>scared her.&nbsp; John was busy that month and left the bills to her,
the

<P>next month he was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly

<P>settling up, and Meg never forgot it.&nbsp; A few days before she had
done

<P>a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience.&nbsp; Sallie had

<P>been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one, just a handsome light

<P>one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things for

<P>evening wear were only proper for girls.&nbsp; Aunt March usually gave
the

<P>sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.&nbsp;
That

<P>was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at

<P>a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared to take it.&nbsp;
John

<P>always said what was his was hers, but would he think it right to

<P>spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but another

<P>five-and-twenty out of the household fund?&nbsp; That was the question.

<P>Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to lend the money, and with

<P>the best intentions in life had tempted Meg beyond her strength.

<P>In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, shimmering folds,

<P>and said, "A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am." She answered, "I'll take

<P>it," and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and she

<P>had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven away,

<P>feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse

<P>by spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now,

<P>didn't become her, after all, and the words `fifty dollars' seemed

<P>stamped like a pattern down each breadth.&nbsp; She put it away, but
it

<P>haunted her, not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully

<P>like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid.&nbsp; When John
got

<P>out his books that night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time

<P>in her married life, she was afraid of her husband.&nbsp; The kind,
brown

<P>eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually

<P>merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn't mean to let her

<P>know it.&nbsp; The house bills were all paid, the books all in order.

<P>John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they

<P>called the `bank', when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty, stopped

<P>his hand, saying nervously...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You haven't seen my private expense book yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing

<P>so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women

<P>wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning

<P>of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three

<P>rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be

<P>a bonnet, and cost six dollars.&nbsp; That night he looked as if he
would

<P>like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified

<P>at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of

<P>his prudent wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him.

<P>Meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles

<P>out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her

<P>panic increasing with every word .&nbsp; ..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really

<P>been dreadfully extravagant lately.&nbsp; I go about so much I must
have

<P>things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and

<P>my New Year's money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after

<P>I had done it, for I knew you'd think it wrong in me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,

<P>"Don't go and hide.&nbsp; I won't beat you if you have got

<P>a pair of killing boots.&nbsp; I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and

<P>don't mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if

<P>they are good ones."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That had been one of her last `trifles', and John's eye had

<P>fallen on it as he spoke.&nbsp; "Oh, what will he say when he comes
to

<P>that awful fifty dollars!" thought Meg, with a shiver.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress," she said, with the

<P>calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, dear, what is the `dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at

<P>her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to

<P>meet and answer with one as frank till now.&nbsp; She turned the page
and

<P>her head at the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been

<P>bad enough without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with

<P>that added.&nbsp; For a minute the room was very still, then John said

<P>slowly--but she could feel it cost him an effort to express no

<P>displeasure--. . .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the

<P>furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It isn't made or trimmed," sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden

<P>recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small

<P>woman, but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's

<P>when she gets it on," said John dryly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it.&nbsp; I don't mean

<P>to waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would

<P>count up so.&nbsp; I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all
she

<P>wants, and pitying me because I don't.&nbsp; I try to be contented,
but

<P>it is hard, and I'm tired of being poor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear

<P>them, but he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied

<P>himself many pleasures for Meg's sake.&nbsp; She could have bitten her

<P>tongue out the minute she had said it, for John pushed the books

<P>away and got up, saying with a little quiver in his voice, "I was

<P>afraid of this.&nbsp; I do my best, Meg."&nbsp; If he had scolded her,
or

<P>even shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few

<P>words.&nbsp; She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant

<P>tears, "Oh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy.&nbsp; I didn't mean

<P>it!&nbsp; It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say
it!

<P>Oh, how could I say it!"

<P>He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one

<P>reproach, but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which

<P>would not be forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it

<P>again.&nbsp; She had promised to love him for better or worse, and then

<P>she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, after spending

<P>his earnings recklessly.&nbsp; It was dreadful, and the worst of it
was

<P>John went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened,

<P>except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when she

<P>had gone to cry herself to sleep.&nbsp; A week or remorse nearly made

<P>Meg sick, and the discovery that John had countermanded the order

<P>for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was

<P>pathetic to behold.&nbsp; He had simply said, in answer to her surprised

<P>inquiries as to the change, "I can't afford it, my dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the

<P>hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her

<P>heart would break.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her

<P>husband better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a

<P>man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way,

<P>and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort

<P>the natural longings and failures of those he loved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told

<P>the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.&nbsp; The good-

<P>natured Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to

<P>make her a present of it immediately afterward.&nbsp; Then Meg ordered

<P>home the greatcoat, and when John arrived, she put it on, and asked

<P>him how he liked her new silk gown.&nbsp; One can imagine what answer
he

<P>made, how he received his present, and what a blissful state of

<P>things ensued.&nbsp; John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that

<P>greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband, and

<P>taken off at night by a most devoted little wife.&nbsp; So the year

<P>rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience,

<P>the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one

<P>Saturday, with an excited face, and was received with the clash

<P>of cymbals, for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one

<P>and the cover in the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How's the little mamma?&nbsp; Where is everybody?&nbsp; Why didn't

<P>you tell me before I came home?" began Laurie in a loud whisper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Happy as a queen, the dear!&nbsp; Every soul of `em is upstairs

<P>a worshipin'.&nbsp; We didn't want no hurrycanes round.&nbsp; Now you
go

<P>into the parlor, and I'll send `em down to you," with which

<P>somewhat involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid

<P>forth upon a large pillow.&nbsp; Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes

<P>twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed

<P>emotion of some sort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms," she said invitingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands

<P>behind him with an imploring gesture.&nbsp; "No, thank you.&nbsp; I'd
rather

<P>not.&nbsp; I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then you shan't see your nevvy," said Jo decidedly, turning

<P>as if to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will, I will!&nbsp; Only you must be responsible for damages."

<P>And obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something

<P>was put into his arms.&nbsp; A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy,

<P>Mrs. March, Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next

<P>minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead of one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was

<P>droll enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly

<P>from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with

<P>such dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Twins, by Jupiter!" was all he said for a minute, then

<P>turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically

<P>piteous, he added, "Take `em quick, somebody!&nbsp; I'm going to

<P>laugh, and I shall drop `em."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one

<P>on each are, as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending,

<P>while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it?&nbsp; I wouldn't have

<P>told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter

<P>myself I've done it," said Jo, when she got her breath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never was more staggered in my life.&nbsp; Isn't it fun?&nbsp; Are
they boys?

<P>What are you going to name them?&nbsp; Let's have another look.&nbsp;
Hold me up,

<P>Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me," returned Laurie,

<P>regarding the infants with the air of a big,&nbsp; benevolent Newfoundland

<P>looking at a pair of infantile kittens.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Boy and girl.&nbsp; Aren't they beauties?" said the proud papa,

<P>beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Most remarkable children I ever saw.&nbsp; Which is which?" and

<P>Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl,

<P>French fashion, so you can always tell.&nbsp; Besides, one has blue

<P>eyes and one brown.&nbsp; Kiss them, Uncle Teddy," said wicked Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid they mightn't like it," began Laurie, with unusual

<P>timidity in such matters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course they will, they are used to it now.&nbsp; Do it this

<P>minute, sir!" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck

<P>at each little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the

<P>babies squeal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, I knew they didn't like it!&nbsp; That's the boy, see

<P>him kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one.&nbsp; Now then,

<P>young Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?" cried

<P>Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping

<P>aimlessly about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after

<P>mother and grandmother.&nbsp; We shall call her Daisey, so as not to

<P>have two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we

<P>find a better name," said Amy, with aunt-like interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short," said Laurie
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Daisy and Demi, just the thing!&nbsp; I knew Teddy would do it,"

<P>cried Jo clapping her hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were

<P>`Daisy' and `Demi' to the end of the chapter.
