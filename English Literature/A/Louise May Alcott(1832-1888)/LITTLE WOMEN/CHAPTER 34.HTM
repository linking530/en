<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and

<P>very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it

<P>sweeter for the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors.

<P>The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one

<P>to a poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain

<P>her end were not the best.&nbsp; She saw that money conferred power,

<P>therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself alone,

<P>but for those whom she loved more than life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything

<P>she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom,

<P>going abroad herself, and always having more than enough,

<P>so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been

<P>for years Jo's most cherished castle in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which

<P>might, after long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this

<P>delightful chateau en Espagne.&nbsp; But the novel disaster quenched

<P>her courage for a time, for public opinion is a giant which has

<P>frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers.

<P>Like that immortal hero, she reposed awhile after the first

<P>attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the

<P>giant's treasures, if I remember rightly.&nbsp; But the `up again

<P>and take another' spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so

<P>she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more

<P>booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious

<P>than the moneybags.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark

<P>ages, even all-perfect America read rubbish.&nbsp; She told no one,

<P>but concocted a `thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself

<P>to Mr. Dashwood, editor of the Weekly Volcano.&nbsp; She had

<P>never read Sartor Resartus, but she had a womanly instinct

<P>that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many

<P>than the worth of character or the magic of manners.&nbsp; So she

<P>dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself

<P>that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two

<P>pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly

<P>room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen,

<P>sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats,

<P>which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove

<P>on her appearance.&nbsp; somewhat daunted by this reception, Jo hesitated

<P>on the threshold, murmuring in much embarrassment...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office.

<P>I wished to see Mr. Dashwood."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest

<P>gentleman, and carefully cherishing his cigar between his

<P>fingers, he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive

<P>of nothing but sleep.&nbsp; Feeling that she must get through the

<P>matter somehow, Jo produced her manuscript and, blushing

<P>redder and redder with each sentence, blundered out fragments

<P>of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as

<P>an experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more

<P>if this suits."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken

<P>the manuscript, and was turning over the leaves with a pair

<P>of rather dirty fingers, and casting critical glances up and

<P>down the neat pages.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a first attempt, I take it?" observing that the

<P>pages were numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied

<P>up with a ribbon--sure sign of a novice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, sir.&nbsp; She has had some experience, and got a prize

<P>for a tale in the BLARNEYSTONE BANNER."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, did she?" And Mr. Dashwood gave JO a quick look,

<P>which seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the

<P>bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots.&nbsp; "Well, you

<P>can leave it, if you like.&nbsp; We've more of this sort of thing

<P>on hand than we know what to do with at present, but I'll run

<P>my eye over it, and give you an answer next week."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, Jo did not like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't

<P>suit her at all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing

<P>for her to do but bow and walk away, looking particularly tall

<P>and dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed.

<P>Just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident from the

<P>knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little

<P>fiction of `my friend' was considered a good joke, and a

<P>laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as

<P>he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.&nbsp; Half resolving

<P>never to return, she went home, and worked off her

<P>irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an

<P>hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long

<P>for next week.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she

<P>rejoiced.&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than before,

<P>which was agreeable and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed

<P>in a cigar to remember his manners, so the second

<P>interview was much more comfortable than the first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't

<P>object to a few alterations.&nbsp; It's too long, but omitting

<P>the passages I've marked will make it just the right length,"

<P>he said, in a businesslike tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo hardly knew her own MS again, so crumpled and underscored

<P>were its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender

<P>patent might on being asked to cut off her baby's legs in

<P>order that it might fit into a new cradle, she looked at the

<P>marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral

<P>reflections--which she had carefully put in as ballast for

<P>much romance--had been stricken out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of

<P>a moral, so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for

<P>Jo had forgotten her `friend', and spoken as only an author

<P>could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.&nbsp; Morals

<P>don't sell nowadays."&nbsp; Which was not quite a correct statement,

<P>by the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think it would do with these alterations, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language

<P>good, and so on," was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you--that is, what compensation--" began Jo, not

<P>exactly knowing how to express herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for

<P>things of this sort.&nbsp; Pay when it comes out," returned Mr. Dashwood,

<P>as if that point had escaped him.&nbsp; Such trifles do escape

<P>the editorial mind, it is said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, you can have it," said Jo, handing back the

<P>story with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work,

<P>even twenty-five seemed good pay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one

<P>better than this?" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of

<P>the tongue, and emboldened by her success.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, we'll look at it.&nbsp; Can't promise to take it.&nbsp; Tell
her

<P>to make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral.&nbsp; What name

<P>would your friend like to put on it?" in a careless tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to

<P>appear and has no nom de plume," said Jo, blushing in spite of

<P>herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just as she likes, of course.&nbsp; The tale will be out next week.

<P>Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?" asked Mr. Dashwood,

<P>who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll call.&nbsp; Good morning, Sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful

<P>remark, "Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury

<P>her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational

<P>literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,

<P>she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters

<P>and scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses

<P>appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as

<P>much accuracy and spirit as could be expected.&nbsp; Her readers

<P>were not particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation,

<P>and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to

<P>fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it necessary

<P>to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the

<P>fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had

<P>basely left him in the lurch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated

<P>purse grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take

<P>Beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as

<P>the weeks passed.&nbsp; One thing disturbed her satisfaction, and

<P>that was that she did not tell them at home.&nbsp; She had a feeling

<P>that Father and Mother would not approve, and preferred to have

<P>her own way first, and beg pardon afterward.&nbsp; It was easy to

<P>keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories.&nbsp; Mr.

<P>Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but promised

<P>to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely

<P>meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed, and

<P>quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the

<P>happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over

<P>her well-kept secret.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as

<P>thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls

<P>of the readers, history and romance, land and sea, science and

<P>art, police records and lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked

<P>for the purpose.&nbsp; Jo soon found that her innocent experience

<P>had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which

<P>underlies society, so regarding it in a business light, she set

<P>about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy.

<P>Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them

<P>original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched

<P>newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes.&nbsp; She excited

<P>the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on

<P>poisons.&nbsp; She studied faces in the street, and characters,

<P>good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.&nbsp; She delved in

<P>the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that

<P>they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,

<P>and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.&nbsp; She

<P>thought she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was

<P>beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a

<P>woman's character.&nbsp; She was living in bad society, and imaginary

<P>though it was, its influence affected her, for she was

<P>feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food,

<P>and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by

<P>a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life, which

<P>comes soon enough to all of us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much

<P>describing of other people's passions and feelings set her

<P>to studying and speculating about her own.&nbsp; a morbid amusement

<P>in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge.

<P>Wrongdoing always brings its own punishment, and when Jo

<P>most needed hers, she got it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her

<P>to read character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what

<P>was honest, brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary

<P>heroes with every perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering

<P>a live hero, who interested her in spite of many human imperfections.

<P>Mr. Bhaer, in one of their conversations, had advised

<P>her to study simple, true, and lovely characters, wherever she

<P>found them, as good training for a writer.&nbsp; Jo took him at his

<P>word, for she coolly turned round and studied him--a proceeding

<P>which would have much surprised him, had he know it, for the

<P>worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.&nbsp; He

<P>was neither rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect

<P>what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet

<P>he was as attractive as a genial fire, and people seemed to

<P>gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth.&nbsp; He was

<P>poor, yet always appeared to be giving something away; a

<P>stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer young, but

<P>as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face

<P>looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven

<P>for his sake.&nbsp; Jo often watched him, trying to discover

<P>the charm, and at last decided that it was benevolence which

<P>worked the miracle.&nbsp; If he had any sorrow, `it sat with its

<P>head under its wing', and he turned only his sunny side to the

<P>world.&nbsp; There were lines upon his forehead, but Time seemed

<P>to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to

<P>others.&nbsp; The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials

<P>of many friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never

<P>cold or hard, and his big hand had a warm, strong grasp

<P>that was more expressive than words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature

<P>of the wearer.&nbsp; They looked as if they were at ease, and liked

<P>to make him comfortable.&nbsp; His capacious waistcoat was sugges-

<P>tive of a large heart underneath.&nbsp; His rusty coat had a social

<P>air, and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands

<P>often went in empty and came out full.&nbsp; His very boots were

<P>benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy like other people's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's it!" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered

<P>that genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify

<P>and dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner,

<P>darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most

<P>feminine respect for intellect, and a little discovery which

<P>she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him.

<P>He never spoke of himself, and no one ever knew that in his

<P>native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for

<P>learning and integrity, till a countryman came to see him.

<P>He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss

<P>Norton divulged the pleasing fact.&nbsp; From her Jo learned it,

<P>and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told

<P>it.&nbsp; She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor

<P>in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in America,

<P>and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the

<P>spice of romance which this discovery gave it.

<P>Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in

<P>a most unexpected manner.&nbsp; Miss Norton had the entree into

<P>most society, which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but

<P>for her.&nbsp; The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious

<P>girl, and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo

<P>and the Professor.&nbsp; She took them with her one night to a select

<P>symposium, held in honor of several celebrities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones

<P>whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.&nbsp; But

<P>her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night,

<P>and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that

<P>the great creatures were only men and women after all.&nbsp; Imagine

<P>her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the

<P>poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on `spirit,

<P>fire, and dew', to behold him devouring his supper with an

<P>ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.&nbsp; Turning

<P>as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which

<P>rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions.&nbsp; The great novelist

<P>vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum;

<P>the famous divine flirted openly with one of the

<P>Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at another

<P>Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering

<P>her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed

<P>tea Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the

<P>lady rendering speech impossible.&nbsp; The scientific celebrities,

<P>forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about

<P>art, while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with

<P>characteristic energy; the young musician, who was charming

<P>the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen

<P>of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary

<P>man of the party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely

<P>disillusioned, that she sat down in a corner to recover herself.

<P>Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather out of his element,

<P>and presently several of the philosophers, each mounted on his

<P>hobby, came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in

<P>the recess.&nbsp; The conversations were miles beyond Jo's comprehension,

<P>but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were unknown

<P>gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms, and

<P>the only thing `evolved from her inner consciousness' was a

<P>bad headache after it was all over.&nbsp; It dawned upon her gradually

<P>that the world was being picked to pieces, and put together on

<P>new and, according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles

<P>than before, that religion was in a fair way to be

<P>reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be the only

<P>God.&nbsp; Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any

<P>sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful,

<P>came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned

<P>adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and

<P>found him looking at her with the grimest expression she had

<P>ever seen him wear.&nbsp; He shook his head and beckoned her to

<P>come away, but she was fascinated just then by the freedom

<P>of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat, trying to find

<P>out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after

<P>they had annihilated all the old beliefs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his

<P>own opinions, not because they were unsettled, but too sincere

<P>and earnest to be lightly spoken.&nbsp; As he glanced from Jo

<P>to several other young people, attracted by the brilliancy

<P>of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his brows and longed

<P>to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul would be

<P>led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over

<P>that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed

<P>to for an opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and

<P>defended religion with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence

<P>which made his broken English musical and his plain

<P>face beautiful.&nbsp; He had a hard fight, for the wise men argued

<P>well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and stood to his

<P>colors like a man.&nbsp; Somehow, as he talked, the world got

<P>right again to Jo.&nbsp; The old beliefs, that had lasted so long,

<P>seemed better than the new.&nbsp; God was not a blind force, and

<P>immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.&nbsp; She

<P>felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again, and

<P>when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but not one whit convinced,

<P>Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave

<P>the Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him

<P>an effort to speak out then and there, because his conscience

<P>would not let him be silent.&nbsp; She began to see that character

<P>is a better possession than money, rank, intellect, or beauty,

<P>and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined

<P>it to be, `truth, reverence, and good will', then her friend

<P>friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This belief strengthened daily.&nbsp; She valued his esteem,

<P>she coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship,

<P>and just when the wish was sincerest, she came near to

<P>losing everything.&nbsp; It all grew out of a cocked hat, for one

<P>evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a

<P>paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put there and

<P>he had forgotten to take off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming

<P>down," thought Jo, with a smile, as he said "Goot efening,"

<P>and sat soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous

<P>contrast between his subject and his headgear, for he was

<P>going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh

<P>out his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she

<P>left him to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all

<P>about it, for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing

<P>occupation.&nbsp; After the reading came the lesson, which

<P>was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night, and

<P>the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.&nbsp; The

<P>Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at

<P>last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible

<P>...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face?

<P>Haf you no respect for me, that you go on so bad?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take

<P>your hat off?" said Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor

<P>gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a

<P>minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry

<P>bass viol.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a

<P>fool with my cap.&nbsp; Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this

<P>lesson goes not well, you too shall wear him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because

<P>Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it,

<P>said with great disgust, "I wish these papers did not come in the house.

<P>They are not for children to see,&nbsp; nor young people to read.

<P>It is not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration

<P>composed of a lunatic, a corpse, a villian, and a viper.&nbsp; She

<P>did not like it, but the impulse that made her turn it over

<P>was not one of displeasure but fear, because for a minute

<P>she fancied the paper was the Volcano.&nbsp; It was not, however,

<P>and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it

<P>had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have

<P>been no name to betray her.&nbsp; She had betrayed herself, however,

<P>by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the

<P>Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied.&nbsp; He

<P>knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper

<P>offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it,

<P>he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her

<P>work.&nbsp; Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she

<P>was ashamed to own, and it troubled him.&nbsp; He did not say to

<P>himself, "It is none of my business.&nbsp; I've no right to say

<P>anything," as many people would have done.&nbsp; He only remembered

<P>that she was young and poor, a girl far away from

<P>mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help

<P>her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which

<P>would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from

<P>a puddle.&nbsp; All this flashed through his mind in a minute,

<P>but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by the

<P>time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he

<P>was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you are right to put it from you.&nbsp; I do not think

<P>that good young girls should see such things.&nbsp; They are made

<P>pleasant to some, but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder

<P>to play with than this bad trash."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there

<P>is a demand for it, I don't see any harm in supplying it.

<P>Many very respectable people make an honest living out of

<P>what are called sensation stories," said Jo, scratching gathers

<P>so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do

<P>not care to sell it.&nbsp; If the respectable people knew what harm

<P>they did, they would not feel that the living was honest.&nbsp; They

<P>haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum, and let the small

<P>ones eat it.&nbsp; No, they should think a little, and sweep mud in

<P>the street before they do this thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling

<P>the paper in his hands.&nbsp; Jo sat still, looking as if the fire

<P>had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked

<P>hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered

<P>the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would

<P>make, and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience

<P>at that minute.&nbsp; Then she thought consolingly to herself,

<P>"Mine are not like that, they are only silly, never bad,

<P>so I won't be worried," and taking up her book, she said,

<P>with a studious face, "Shall we go on, Sir?&nbsp; I'll be very

<P>good and proper now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall hope so," was all he said, but he meant more than

<P>she imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her

<P>feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large

<P>type on her forehead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers,

<P>and carefully reread every one of her stories.&nbsp; Being a little

<P>shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo

<P>had tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the

<P>fine print of her book.&nbsp; Now she seemed to have on the Professor's

<P>mental or moral spectacles also, for the faults of these

<P>poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go

<P>on, for each is more sensational than the last.&nbsp; I've gone

<P>blindly on, hurting myself and other people, for the sake of

<P>money.&nbsp; I know it's so, for I can't read this stuff in sober

<P>earnest without being horribly ashamed of it, and what should

<P>I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle

<P>into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense.

<P>I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other

<P>people blow themselves up with my gunpowder," she thought as

<P>she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black

<P>cinder with fiery eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when nothing remained of all her three month's work

<P>except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked

<P>sober, as she sat on the floor, wondering what she ought to

<P>do about her wages.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this

<P>to pay for my time," she said, after a long meditation, adding

<P>impatiently, "I almost wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so

<P>inconvenient.&nbsp; If I didn't care about doing right, and didn't

<P>feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally.

<P>I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn't

<P>been so particular about such things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that `Father

<P>and Mother were particular'.&nbsp; and pity from your heart those

<P>who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles

<P>which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth,

<P>but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon

<P>in womanhood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the

<P>money did not pay for her share of the sensation, but going

<P>to the other extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp,

<P>she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah

<P>More, and then produced a tale which might have been more

<P>properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral

<P>was it.&nbsp; She had her doubts about it from the beginning, for

<P>her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the

<P>new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff

<P>and cumbrous costume of the last century.&nbsp; She sent this didactic

<P>gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser,

<P>and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals

<P>didn't sell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have

<P>disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy

<P>lucre for it.&nbsp; The only person who offered enough to make it

<P>worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman

<P>who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his

<P>particular belief.&nbsp; But much as she liked to write for children,

<P>Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as

<P>being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did

<P>not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants

<P>who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded

<P>gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life

<P>with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues.&nbsp; So nothing

<P>came of these trials, land Jo corked up her inkstand, and

<P>said in a fit of very wholesome humility...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't know anything.&nbsp; I'll wait until I do before I try

<P>again, and meantime, `sweep mud in the street' if I can't do

<P>better, that's honest, at least."&nbsp; Which decision proved that

<P>her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While these internal revolutions were going on, her external

<P>life had been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she

<P>sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed

<P>it but Professor Bhaer.&nbsp; He did it so quietly that Jo never

<P>knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by

<P>his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was satisfied, for

<P>though no words passed between them, he knew that she had

<P>given up writing.&nbsp; Not only did he guess it by the fact that

<P>the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but

<P>she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more among

<P>newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience, which

<P>assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with

<P>something useful, if not pleasant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend,

<P>and Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning

<P>other lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the

<P>sensation story of her own life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not

<P>leave Mrs. Kirke till June.&nbsp; Everyone seemed sorry when the time

<P>came.&nbsp; The children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair

<P>stuck straight up all over his head, for he always rumpled it

<P>wildly when disturbed in mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Going home?&nbsp; Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go

<P>in," he said, when she told him, and sat silently pulling his

<P>beard in the corner, while she held a little levee on that last

<P>evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight,

<P>and when his turn came, she said warmly, "Now, Sir, you won't

<P>forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you?

<P>I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my

<P>friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you?&nbsp; Shall I come?" he asked, looking down at her with

<P>an eager expression which she did not see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, come next month.&nbsp; Laurie graduates then, and you'd

<P>enjoy commencement as something new."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?" he said in

<P>an altered tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, my boy Teddy.&nbsp; I'm very proud of him and should like

<P>you to see him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her

<P>own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another.

<P>Something in Mr. Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that

<P>she might find Laurie more than a `best friend', and simply

<P>because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was

<P>the matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she

<P>tried not to, the redder she grew.&nbsp; If it had not been for Tina

<P>on her knee.&nbsp; She didn't know what would have become of her.

<P>Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to

<P>hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it.

<P>But he did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety

<P>to its usual expression, as he said cordially...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend

<P>much success, and you all happiness.&nbsp; Gott bless you!"&nbsp; And
with that,

<P>he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire

<P>with the tired look on his face and the `heimweh', or homesickness,

<P>lying heavy at his heart.&nbsp; Once, when he remembered

<P>Jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new

<P>softness in her face, he leaned his head on his hands a minute,

<P>and then roamed about the room, as if in search of something

<P>that he could not find.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not for me, I must not hope it now," he said to himself,

<P>with a sigh that was almost a groan.&nbsp; Then, as if reproach-

<P>ing himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went

<P>and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his

<P>seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his Plato.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found

<P>that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato,

<P>were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see

<P>Jo off, and thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with

<P>the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a

<P>bunch of violets to keep her company, and best of all, the happy

<P>thought, "Well, the winter's gone, and I've written no books,

<P>earned no fortune, but I've made a friend worth having and I'll

<P>try to keep him all my life."
