<P>London
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dearest People,

<P>Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,

<P>Piccadilly.&nbsp; It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped

<P>here years ago, and won't go anywhere else.&nbsp; However, we don't

<P>mean to stay long, so it's no great matter.&nbsp; Oh, I can't begin

<P>to tell you how I enjoy it all!&nbsp; I never can, so I'll only give

<P>you bits out of my notebook, for I've done nothing but sketch

<P>and scribble since I started.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable,

<P>but after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all

<P>day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me.&nbsp; Everyone was

<P>very kind to me, especially the officers.&nbsp; Don't laugh, Jo,

<P>gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to,

<P>or to wait upon one, and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy

<P>to make them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death,

<P>I'm afraid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let

<P>alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and

<P>enjoyed myself.&nbsp; Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid

<P>air and waves!&nbsp; It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse,

<P>when we went rushing on so grandly.&nbsp; I wish Beth could have come,

<P>it would have done her so much good.&nbsp; As for Jo, she would have

<P>gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or whatever the high thing

<P>is called, made friends with the engineers, and tooted on the

<P>captain's speaking trumpet, she'd have been in such a state of

<P>rapture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast,

<P>and found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins

<P>here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's

<P>countryseats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks.

<P>It was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to

<P>see it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore so picturesque,

<P>and a rosy sky overhead.&nbsp; I never shall forget it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At Queenstown on of my new acquaintances left us, Mr.

<P>Lennox, and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney,

<P>he sighed and and, with a look at me...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?

<P>She lives on the banks of Killarney;

<P>From the glance of her eye,

<P>Shun danger and fly,

<P>For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wasn't that nonsensical?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours.&nbsp; It's a dirty,

<P>noisy place, and I was glad to leave it.&nbsp; Uncle rushed out and

<P>bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an

<P>umbrella, and got shaved `a la mutton chop, the first thing.

<P>Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton,

<P>but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the

<P>little bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said,

<P>with a grin, "There yer har, sir.&nbsp; I've given `em the latest

<P>Yankee shine."&nbsp; It amused Uncle immensely.&nbsp; Oh, I must tell
you

<P>what that absurd Lennox did!&nbsp; He got his friend Ward, who came

<P>on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I

<P>saw in my room was a lovely one, with "Robert Lennox's compliments,"

<P>on the card.&nbsp; Wasn't that fun, girls? I like traveling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.&nbsp; The trip was

<P>like riding through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes.

<P>The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs,

<P>ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy

<P>children at the doors.&nbsp; The very cattle looked more tranquil

<P>than ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had

<P>a contented cluck, as if they never got nervous like Yankee

<P>biddies.&nbsp; Such perfect color I never saw, the grass so green, sky

<P>so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a rapture all

<P>the way.&nbsp; So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to the

<P>other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at

<P>the rate of sixty miles an hour.&nbsp; Aunt was tired and went to sleep,

<P>but Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything.

<P>This is the way we went on.&nbsp; Amy, flying up--"Oh, that

<P>must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!"&nbsp; Flo, darting

<P>to my window--"How sweet!&nbsp; We must go there sometime, won't we

<P>Papa?" Uncle, calmly admiring his boots--"No, my dear, not unless

<P>you want beer, that's a brewery."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A pause--then Flo cried out, "Bless me, there's a gallows and

<P>a man going up."&nbsp; "Where, where?" shrieks Amy, staring out at two

<P>tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains.&nbsp; "A colliery,"

<P>remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.&nbsp; "Here's a lovely flock

<P>of lambs all lying down," says Amy.&nbsp; "See, Papa, aren't they

<P>pretty?" added Flo sentimentally.&nbsp; "Geese, young ladies," returns

<P>Uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to

<P>enjoy the FLIRTATIONS OF CAPTAIN CAVENDISH, and I have the scenery

<P>all to myself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was

<P>nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas.&nbsp; We rested, unpacked,

<P>and shopped a little between the showers.&nbsp; Aunt Mary got me some

<P>new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready.

<P>A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the

<P>loveliest mantle you ever saw.&nbsp; Shopping in Regent Street is

<P>perfectly splendid.&nbsp; Things seem so cheap, nice ribbons only

<P>sixpence a yard.&nbsp; I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves

<P>in Paris.&nbsp; Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while

<P>Aunt and Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned

<P>afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in

<P>them alone.&nbsp; It was so droll!&nbsp; For when we were shut in by
the

<P>wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and

<P>told me to stop him.&nbsp; but he was up outside behind somewhere,

<P>and I couldn't get at him.&nbsp; He didn't hear me call, nor see me

<P>flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless,

<P>rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace.

<P>At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on

<P>poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, then, mum?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down

<P>the door, with an "Aye, aye, mum," the man made his horse walk,

<P>as if going to a funeral.&nbsp; I poked again and said, "A little

<P>faster," then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we

<P>resigned ourselves to our fate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we

<P>are more aristocratic than we look.&nbsp; The Duke of Devonshire lives

<P>near.&nbsp; I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and

<P>the Duke of Wellington's house is not far off.&nbsp; Such sights as
I

<P>saw, my dear!&nbsp; It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers

<P>rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous

<P>Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered

<P>coachmen in front.&nbsp; Smart maids, with the rosiest children

<P>I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer

<P>English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall soldiers,

<P>in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side, looking

<P>so funny I longed to sketch them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Rotten Row means `Route de Roi', or the king's way, but

<P>now it's more like a riding school than anything else.&nbsp; The

<P>horses are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride

<P>well, but the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according

<P>to our rules.&nbsp; I longed to show them a tearing American

<P>gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant

<P>habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's

<P>Ark.&nbsp; Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little children--

<P>and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I say a pair

<P>exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the

<P>button-hole, and I thought it rather a nice little idea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the P.M.&nbsp; to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to

<P>describe it, that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime!

<P>This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate

<P>end to the happiest day of my life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning

<P>without telling you what happened last evening.&nbsp; Who do

<P>you think came in, as we were at tea?&nbsp; Laurie's English friends,

<P>Fred and Frank Vaughn!&nbsp; I was so surprised, for I shouldn't have

<P>known them but for the cards.&nbsp; both are tall fellows with whiskers,

<P>Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better,

<P>for he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches.&nbsp; They had heard

<P>from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their

<P>house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see

<P>them as we can.&nbsp; They went to the theater with us, and we did

<P>have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and

<P>Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we

<P>had know each other all our days.&nbsp; Tell Beth Frank asked for her,

<P>and was sorry to hear of her ill health.&nbsp; Fred laughed when I

<P>spoke of Jo, and sent his `respectful compliments to the big hat'.

<P>Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had

<P>there.&nbsp; What ages ago it seems, doesn't it?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must

<P>stop.&nbsp; I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing

<P>here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head

<P>a jumble of parks, theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures

<P>who say "Ah!" and twirl their blond mustaches with the true

<P>English lordliness.&nbsp; I long to see you all, and in spite of my

<P>nonsense am, as ever, your loving...

<P>AMY
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PARIS
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear girls,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the

<P>Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.&nbsp; I enjoyed

<P>the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than

<P>anything else, for at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and

<P>at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds,

<P>Hogarth, and the other great creatures.&nbsp; The day in Richmond

<P>Park was charming, for we had a regular English picnic, and

<P>I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I could copy,

<P>also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.&nbsp; We `did' London

<P>to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry

<P>to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in,

<P>when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone

<P>in hospitality, I think.&nbsp; The Vaughns hope to meet us in

<P>Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they

<P>don't, for Grace and I are great friends, and the boys very

<P>nice fellows, especially Fred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again,

<P>saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland.

<P>Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she

<P>couldn't say a word.&nbsp; And now we get on nicely, and are very

<P>glad he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't

<P>know what we should do without him.&nbsp; Uncle doesn't know ten

<P>words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if it

<P>would make people understand him.&nbsp; Aunt's pronunciation is

<P>old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves

<P>that we knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful

<P>to have Fred do the `parley vooing', as Uncle calls it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such delightful times as we are having!&nbsp; Sight-seeing from

<P>morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes,

<P>and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures.&nbsp; Rainy days I

<P>spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures.&nbsp; Jo would turn up

<P>her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no

<P>soul for art, but I have, and I'm cultivation eye and taste

<P>as fast as I can.&nbsp; She would like the relics of great people

<P>better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray

<P>coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie

<P>Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's

<P>sword, and many other interesting things.&nbsp; I'll talk for hours

<P>about them when I come, but haven't time to write.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of bijouterie

<P>and lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't

<P>buy them.&nbsp; Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't

<P>allow it.&nbsp; Then the Bois and Champs Elysees are tres magnifique.

<P>I've seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly,

<P>hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in

<P>bad taste, I thought--purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves.

<P>Little Nap is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his tutor,

<P>and kissed his hand to the people as he passes in his four-horse

<P>barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted

<P>guard before and behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are

<P>lovely, though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better.

<P>Pere la Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are

<P>like small rooms, and looking in, one sees a table, with

<P>images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners

<P>to sit in when they come to lament.&nbsp; That is so Frenchy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the

<P>balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street.&nbsp; It

<P>is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when

<P>too tired with our day's work to go out.&nbsp; Fred is very entertaining,

<P>and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew--

<P>except Laurie, whose manners are more charming.&nbsp; I wish Fred

<P>was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however, the Vaughns

<P>are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won't

<P>find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as

<P>we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty

<P>letters.&nbsp; I keep my diary, and try to `remember correctly and

<P>describe clearly all that I see and admire', as Father advised.

<P>It is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give

<P>you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.

<P>VOTRE AMIE
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>HEIDELBERG
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My dear Mamma,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to

<P>tell you what has happened, for some of it is very important,

<P>as you will see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed

<P>it with all my might.&nbsp; Get Father's old guidebooks and

<P>read about it.&nbsp; I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it.

<P>At Coblenz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn,

<P>with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade.

<P>It was a moonlight night, and about one o'clock Flo and I were

<P>waked by the most delicious music under our windows.&nbsp; We flew up,

<P>and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and

<P>the students singing away down below.&nbsp; It was the most romantic

<P>thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress

<P>opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw

<P>them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies,

<P>and go laughing away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.&nbsp; Next

<P>morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest

<P>pocket, and looked very sentimental.&nbsp; I laughed at him, and said

<P>I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him, for he

<P>tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again.&nbsp; I'm

<P>afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to

<P>look like it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden,

<P>where Fred lost some money, and I scolded him.&nbsp; He needs someone

<P>to look after him when Frank is not with him.&nbsp; Kate said

<P>once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her

<P>that it would be well for him.&nbsp; Frankfurt was delightful.&nbsp;
I

<P>saw Goeth's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous

<P>Ariadne.&nbsp; It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it

<P>more if I had known the story better.&nbsp; I didn't like to ask, as

<P>everyone knew it or pretended they did.&nbsp; I wish Jo would tell

<P>me all about it.&nbsp; I ought to have read more, for I find I don't

<P>know anything, and it mortifies me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred

<P>has just gone.&nbsp; He has been so kind and jolly that we all got

<P>quite fond of him.&nbsp; I never thought of anything but a traveling

<P>friendship till the serenade night.&nbsp; Since then I've begun to

<P>feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures

<P>were something more to him than fun.&nbsp; I haven't flirted,

<P>Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and have done

<P>my very best.&nbsp; I can't help it if people like me.&nbsp; I don't
try to

<P>make them, and it worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo

<P>says I haven't got any heart.&nbsp; Now I know Mother will shake her

<P>head, and the girls say, "Oh, the mercenary little wretch!", but

<P>I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,

<P>though I'm not madly in love.&nbsp; I like him, and we get on comfortably

<P>together.&nbsp; He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very

<P>rich--ever so much richer than the Laurences.&nbsp; I don't think his

<P>family would object, and I should be very happy, for they are all

<P>kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me.&nbsp; Fred, as the

<P>eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid

<P>one it is!&nbsp; A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy

<P>as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid

<P>luxury, such as English people believe in.&nbsp; I like it, for it's

<P>genuine.&nbsp; I've seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants,

<P>and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,

<P>lovely grounds, and fine horses.&nbsp; Oh, it would be all I should

<P>ask!&nbsp; And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap

<P>up so readily, and find nothing behind.&nbsp; I may be mercenary,

<P>but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer

<P>than I can help.&nbsp; One of us must marry well.&nbsp; Meg didn't,
Jo

<P>won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all

<P>round.&nbsp; I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised.&nbsp; You may
be

<P>sure of that, and though Fred is not my model hero, he does very

<P>well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very

<P>fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.&nbsp; So I've been turning

<P>the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible to

<P>help seeing that Fred liked me.&nbsp; He said nothing, but little things

<P>showed it.&nbsp; He never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the

<P>carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone,

<P>and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak tome.&nbsp; Yesterday

<P>at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said

<P>something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about `ein wonderschones

<P>Blondchen', Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his meat

<P>so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.&nbsp; He isn't one of the

<P>cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch

<P>blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at

<P>least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to

<P>the Post Restante for letters.&nbsp; We had a charming time poking

<P>about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the

<P>beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English

<P>wife.&nbsp; I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine,

<P>so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying

<P>to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with scarlet

<P>woodbine sprays hanging round it.&nbsp; I felt as if I'd got into a

<P>romance, sitting there, watching the Meckar rolling through the

<P>valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and

<P>waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.&nbsp; I had a feeling

<P>that something was going to happen and I was ready for it.&nbsp; I

<P>didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little

<P>excited.

<P>By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying

<P>through the great arch to find me.&nbsp; He looked so troubled that
I

<P>forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was.&nbsp; He said

<P>he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was

<P>very ill.&nbsp; So he was going at once on the night train and only

<P>had time to say good-by.&nbsp; I was very sorry for him, and disappointed

<P>for myself, but only for a minute because he said, as he shook hands,

<P>and said it in a way that I could not mistake,&nbsp; "I shall soon come
back,

<P>you won't forget me, Amy?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied,

<P>and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes,

<P>for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much.

<P>I know he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once

<P>hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of

<P>the sort yet a while, for is is a rash boy, and the old gentleman

<P>dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.&nbsp; We shall soon meet in

<P>Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say "Yes, thank

<P>you," when he says "Will you, please?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course this is all very private, but I wished you to

<P>know what was going on.&nbsp; Don't be anxious about me, remember I

<P>am your `prudent Amy', and be sure I will do nothing rashly.

<P>Send me as much advice as you like.&nbsp; I'll use it if I can.&nbsp;
I

<P>wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee.&nbsp; Love and trust me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ever your AMY
