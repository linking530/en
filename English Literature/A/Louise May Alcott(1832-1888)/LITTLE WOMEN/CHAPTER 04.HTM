<P>"Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs

<P>and go on," sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now

<P>the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit

<P>her for going on easily with the task she never liked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time.

<P>Wouldn't it be fun?" answered Jo, yawning dismally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now.

<P>But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets,

<P>and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not

<P>work.&nbsp; It's like other people, you know, and I always envy

<P>girls who do such things, I'm so fond of luxury," said Meg,

<P>trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least

<P>shabby.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but

<P>shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as

<P>Marmee does.&nbsp; I'm sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of

<P>the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've learned to carry her

<P>without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light

<P>that I shan't mind her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits,

<P>but Meg didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting

<P>of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever.

<P>She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty

<P>as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing

<P>her hair in the most becoming way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me

<P>but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty

<P>or not?" she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk.&nbsp; "I

<P>shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little

<P>bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour,

<P>because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.

<P>It's a shame!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at

<P>all agreeable at breakfast time.&nbsp; Everyone seemed rather out

<P>of sorts and inclined to croak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort

<P>herself with the cat and three kittens.&nbsp; Amy was fretting

<P>because her lessons were not learned, and she couldn't

<P>find her rubbers.&nbsp; Jo would whistle and make a great racket

<P>getting ready.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter,

<P>which must go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being

<P>up late didn't suit her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There never was such a cross family!" cried Jo, losing

<P>her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot

<P>lacings, and sat down upon her hat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're the crossest person in it!" returned Amy, washing

<P>out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had

<P>fallen on her slate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar

<P>I'll have them drowned," exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried

<P>to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and

<P>stuck like a burr just out of reach.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed

<P>because she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute!&nbsp; I must get this

<P>off by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your

<P>worry," cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence

<P>in her letter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in,

<P>laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again.

<P>These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called

<P>them `muffs', for they had no others and found the hot

<P>pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or

<P>grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak.

<P>The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home

<P>before two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy.

<P>Goodbye, Marmee.&nbsp; We are a set of rascals this morning, but

<P>we'll come home regular angels.&nbsp; Now then, Meg!"&nbsp; And Jo

<P>tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out

<P>as they ought to do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They always looked back before turning the corner, for

<P>their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and

<P>wave her hand to them.&nbsp; Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't

<P>have got through the day without that, for whatever their

<P>mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was

<P>sure to affect them like sunshine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand

<P>to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches

<P>than we are were never seen," cried Jo, taking a remorseful

<P>satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.

<P>"Don't use such dreadful expressions," replied Meg from

<P>the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself

<P>like a nun sick of the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like good strong words that mean something," replied

<P>Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head

<P>preparatory to flying away altogether.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a

<P>rascal nor a wretch and I don't choose to be called so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because

<P>you can't sit in the lap of luxury all the time.&nbsp; Poor dear,

<P>just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel

<P>in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers,

<P>and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How ridiculous you are, Jo!"&nbsp; But Meg laughed at the

<P>nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and

<P>tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state.

<P>Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me

<P>up.&nbsp; Don't croak any more, but come home jolly, there's a dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder

<P>as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each

<P>hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be

<P>cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the

<P>unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an

<P>unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed

<P>to do something toward their own support, at least.&nbsp; Believing

<P>that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy,

<P>industry, and independence, their parents consented, and

<P>both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite

<P>of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt

<P>rich with her small salary.&nbsp; As she said, she was `fond of

<P>luxury', and her chief trouble was poverty.&nbsp; She found it

<P>harder to bear than the others because she could remember a

<P>time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure,

<P>and want of any kind unknown.&nbsp; She tried not to be envious

<P>or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl

<P>should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments,

<P>and a happy life.&nbsp; At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted,

<P>for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg

<P>caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets,

<P>heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties,

<P>and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished

<P>on trifles which would have been so precious to her.&nbsp; Poor

<P>Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel

<P>bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned

<P>to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can

<P>make life happy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed

<P>an active person to wait upon her.&nbsp; The childless old lady

<P>had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came,

<P>and was much offended because her offer was declined.&nbsp; Other

<P>friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of

<P>being remembered in the rich old lady's will, but the

<P>unworldly Marches only said...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes.&nbsp; Rich

<P>or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening

<P>to meet Jo at at a friend's, something in her comical face

<P>and blunt manners struck the old lady's fancy, and she

<P>proposed to take her for a companion.&nbsp; This did not suit Jo

<P>at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better

<P>appeared and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well

<P>with her irascible relative.&nbsp; There was an occasional tempest,

<P>and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't bear

<P>it longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and

<P>sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she

<P>could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the

<P>peppery old lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I suspect that the real attraction was a large library

<P>of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since

<P>Uncle March died.&nbsp; Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who

<P>used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big

<P>dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his

<P>Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he

<P>met her in the street.&nbsp; The dim, dusty room, with the busts

<P>staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the

<P>globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which

<P>she could wander where she liked, made the library a region

<P>of bliss to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with

<P>company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself

<P>up in the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,

<P>travels, and pictures like a regular bookworm.&nbsp; But, like

<P>all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure as she had

<P>just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of

<P>a song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a

<P>shrill voice called, "Josy-phine! Josy-phine! and she had

<P>to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or

<P>read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid.&nbsp; What

<P>it was, she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell

<P>her, and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the

<P>fact that she couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she

<P>liked.&nbsp; A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit

<P>were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a

<P>series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic.

<P>But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what

<P>she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to

<P>support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual

<P>"Josy-phine!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth was too bashful to go to school.It had been tried,

<P>but she suffered so much that it was given up, and she did

<P>her lessons at home with her father.&nbsp; Even when he went away,

<P>and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to

<P>Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself

<P>and did the best she could.&nbsp; She was a housewifely little

<P>creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable

<P>for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be

<P>loved.&nbsp; Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for

<P>her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she

<P>was by nature a busy bee.&nbsp; There were six dolls to be taken

<P>up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still

<P>and and loved her pets as well as ever.&nbsp; Not one whole or

<P>handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took

<P>them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they

<P>passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly.

<P>Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very

<P>reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls.&nbsp; No pins

<P>were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or

<P>blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the

<P>heart or the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed,

<P>nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed.

<P>One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and,

<P>having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the rag

<P>bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth

<P>and taken to her refuge.&nbsp; Having no top to its head, she

<P>tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were

<P>gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket

<P>and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid.&nbsp; If anyone

<P>had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it

<P>would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed.

<P>She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it

<P>out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang

<P>it lullabies and never went to be without kissing its dirty

<P>face and whispering tenderly, "I hope you'll have a good

<P>night, my poor dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not

<P>being an angel but a very human little girl, she often `wept

<P>a little weep' as Jo said, because she couldn't take music

<P>lessons and have a fine piano.&nbsp; She loved music so dearly,

<P>tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at

<P>the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone

<P>(not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.&nbsp; Nobody did,

<P>however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow

<P>keys, that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone.

<P>She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too

<P>tired for Marmee and the girls, and day after day said

<P>hopefully to herself," I know I'll get my music some time,

<P>if I'm good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting

<P>in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully

<P>that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on

<P>the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence

<P>vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her

<P>life was, she would have answered at once, "My nose."&nbsp; When

<P>she was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod,

<P>and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever.&nbsp; It

<P>was not big nor red, like poor `Petrea's', it was only rather

<P>flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an

<P>aristocratic point.&nbsp; No one minded it but herself, and it was

<P>doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a

<P>Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console

<P>herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Little Raphael," as her sisters called her, had a decided

<P>talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying

<P>flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer

<P>specimens of art.&nbsp; Her teachers complained that instead of

<P>doing her sums she covered her slate with animals, the blank

<P>pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures

<P>of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all

<P>her books at unlucky moments.&nbsp; She got through her lessons as

<P>well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being

<P>a model of deportment.&nbsp; She was a great favorite with her mates,

<P>being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing

<P>without effort.&nbsp; Her little airs and graces were much admired,

<P>so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could

<P>play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing

<P>more than two-thirds of the words.&nbsp; She had a plaintive

<P>way of saying, "When Papa was rich we did so-and-so," which

<P>was very touching, and her long words were considered `perfectly

<P>elegant' by the girls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted

<P>her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely.

<P>One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities.&nbsp; She had to wear

<P>her cousin's clothes.&nbsp; Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of

<P>taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of

<P>a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not

<P>fit.&nbsp; Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's

<P>artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when

<P>her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no

<P>trimming.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My only comfort," she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes,

<P>"is that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm

<P>naughty, as Maria Parks's mother does.&nbsp; My dear, it's really

<P>dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her

<P>knees, and she can't come to school.&nbsp; When I think of this

<P>deggerredation, I fell that I can bear even my flat nose and

<P>purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg was Amy's confidante and monitor, and by some strange

<P>attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's.&nbsp; To Jo alone did

<P>the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum

<P>sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone

<P>in the family.&nbsp; The two older girls were a great deal to one

<P>another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her

<P>keeping and watched over her in her own way, `playing mother'

<P>they called it, and put their sisters in the places of

<P>discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of litte women.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Has anybody got anything to tell?&nbsp; It's been such a dismal

<P>day I'm really dying for some amusement," said Meg, as they sat

<P>sewing together that evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best

<P>of it, I'll tell you about it," began Jo, who dearly loved to tell

<P>stories.&nbsp; "I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning

<P>away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out

<P>some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up.&nbsp; I actually

<P>made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a

<P>gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide

<P>enough to take the whole book in at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I could, and be done with it," said I, trying not to

<P>be saucy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to

<P>sit and think them over while she just `lost' herself for a moment.

<P>She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to

<P>bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the VICAR OF WAKEFIELD out

<P>of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt.

<P>I'd just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I

<P>forgot and laughed out loud.&nbsp; Aunt woke up and, being more

<P>good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what

<P>frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham.

<P>I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only said...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't understand what it's all about.&nbsp; Go back and begin

<P>it, child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I

<P>could.&nbsp; Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place,
and

<P>say meekly, "I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am.&nbsp; Shan't I stop now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her

<P>hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her

<P>short way, `Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did she own she liked it?" asked Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, bless you, no!&nbsp; But she let old Belsham rest, and when I

<P>ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at

<P>the Vicar that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall

<P>because of the good time coming.&nbsp; What a pleasant life she might
have

<P>if only she chose!&nbsp; I don't envy her much, in spite of her money,
for

<P>after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I

<P>think," added Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That reminds me," said Meg, "that I've got something to tell.

<P>It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal

<P>as I came home.&nbsp; At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry,

<P>and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done

<P>something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away.&nbsp; I heard Mrs. King

<P>crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned

<P>away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and

<P>swollen their eyes were.&nbsp; I didn't ask any questions, of course,
but

<P>I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't any wild

<P>brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger

<P>than anything bad boys can do," said Amy, shaking her head, as if

<P>her experience of life had been a deep one.&nbsp; "Susie Perkins came

<P>to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring.&nbsp; I wanted it

<P>dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might.&nbsp; Well, she

<P>drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump,

<P>and the words, `Young ladies, my eye is upon you!' coming out of

<P>his mouth in a balloon thing.&nbsp; We were laughing over it when all

<P>of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up

<P>her slate.&nbsp; She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh,

<P>what do you think he did?&nbsp; He took her by the ear--the ear!&nbsp;
Just

<P>fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation platform, and

<P>made her stand there half and hour, holding the slate so everyone

<P>could see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?" asked Jo, who

<P>relished the scrape.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried

<P>quarts, I know she did.&nbsp; I didn't envy her then, for I felt that

<P>millions of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that.

<P>I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification."

<P>And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue

<P>and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it

<P>at dinner, but I forgot," said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket

<P>in order as she talked.&nbsp; "When I went to get some oysters for Hannah,

<P>Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, for I kept

<P>behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fishman.

<P>A poor woman came in with a pail a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he

<P>would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she

<P>hadn't any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a

<P>day's work.&nbsp; Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said `No', rather

<P>crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr.

<P>Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and

<P>held it out to her.&nbsp; She was so glad and surprised she took it

<P>right into her arms, and thanked him over and over.&nbsp; He told her
to

<P>`go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy!&nbsp; Wasn't
it

<P>good of him?&nbsp; Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery

<P>fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be `aisy'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother

<P>for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, "As I sat

<P>cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very

<P>anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should

<P>be , if anything happened to him.&nbsp; It was not a wise thing to do,

<P>but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some

<P>clothes.&nbsp; He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for
he

<P>looked poor and tired and anxious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought

<P>was not to me.

<P>"Yes, ma'am.&nbsp; I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner,

<P>and I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.'

<P>he answered quietly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`You have done a great deal for your country, sir, ' I said,

<P>feeling respect now, instead of pity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.&nbsp; I'd go myself, if I was

<P>any use.&nbsp; As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad

<P>to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself.&nbsp; I'd given one man
and

<P>thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them.&nbsp;
I had

<P>all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting,

<P>miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps!&nbsp; I felt so rich, so
happy

<P>thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him

<P>some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this.

<P>I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too

<P>preachy," said Jo, after a minute's silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to

<P>this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat

<P>and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends

<P>and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented."

<P>(Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew
diligently.) "These girls were

<P>anxious to be good and made many

<P>excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were

<P>constantly saying, `If only we had this, ' or `If we could only do

<P>that, ' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many

<P>things they actually could do.&nbsp; So they asked an old woman what
spell

<P>they could use to make them happy, and she said, `When you feel

<P>discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'" (Here Jo

<P>looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing

<P>that the story was not done yet.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon

<P>were surprised to see how well off they were.&nbsp; One discovered that

<P>money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses,

<P>another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with

<P>her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble

<P>old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable

<P>as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for

<P>it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as

<P>good behavior.&nbsp; So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the

<P>blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they

<P>should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe

<P>they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's

<P>advice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own

<P>stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!"

<P>cried Meg.

<P>"I like that kind of sermon.&nbsp; It's the sort Father used to tell

<P>us," said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's

<P>cushion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be

<P>more careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susies's downfall,"

<P>said Amy morally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it.&nbsp; If we do so,

<P>you just say to us, as old Chloe did in UNCLE TOM, `Tink ob yer

<P>marcies, chillen! `Tink ob yer marcies!'" added Jo, who could not,

<P>for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little

<P>sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.
