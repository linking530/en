<P>Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained

<P>a month.&nbsp; He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's

<P>familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the

<P>foreign scenes in which she bore a part.&nbsp; He rather missed the

<P>`petting' he used to receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again,

<P>for no attentions, however flattering, from strangers, were half

<P>so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home.&nbsp; Amy

<P>never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad to

<P>see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the

<P>representative of the dear family for whom she longed more

<P>than she would confess.&nbsp; They naturally took comfort in each

<P>other's society and were much together, riding, walking, dancing,

<P>or dawdling, for at Nice no one can be very industrious during

<P>the gay season.&nbsp; But, while apparently amusing themselves in

<P>the most careless fashion, they were half-consciously making

<P>discoveries and forming opinions about each other.&nbsp; Amy rose

<P>daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in hers,

<P>and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.&nbsp; Amy tried

<P>to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many

<P>pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services

<P>to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable

<P>charm.&nbsp; Laurie made no effort of any kind, but just let

<P>himself drift along as comfortably as possible, trying to

<P>forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because

<P>one had been cold to him.&nbsp; It cost him no effort to be

<P>generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in

<P>Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same time he

<P>felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of

<P>him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to

<P>watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.&nbsp; I preferred

<P>to stay at home and write letters.&nbsp; They are done now,

<P>and I am going to Valrosa to sketch, will you come?' said Amy,

<P>as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual

<P>about noon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?"

<P>he answered slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after

<P>the glare without.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can

<P>drive, so you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella,

<P>and keep your gloves nice," returned Amy, with a sarcastic

<P>glance at the immaculate kids, which were a weak point with

<P>Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I'll go with pleasure."&nbsp; And he put out his hand for

<P>her sketchbook.&nbsp; But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't trouble yourself.&nbsp; It's no exertion to me, but you

<P>don't look equal to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace

<P>as she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took

<P>the reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold

<P>his arms and fall asleep on his perch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two never quarreled.&nbsp; Amy was too well-bred, and just now

<P>Laurie was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim

<P>with an inquiring air.&nbsp; She answered him with a smile, and they

<P>went on together in the most amicable manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque

<P>scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.&nbsp; Here an ancient

<P>monastery, whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to

<P>them.&nbsp; There a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat,

<P>and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while

<P>his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet.&nbsp; Meek,

<P>mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass

<P>passed by, with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the

<P>green piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went.

<P>Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels

<P>to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on the bough.

<P>Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage,

<P>fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones

<P>fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights,

<P>the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual

<P>summer roses blossomed everywhere.&nbsp; They overhung the

<P>archway, thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate

<P>with a sweet welcome to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding

<P>through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill.

<P>Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was

<P>a mass of bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling

<P>from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson, white,

<P>or pale pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty.

<P>Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed

<P>the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace,

<P>whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled

<P>city on its shore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it?&nbsp; Did you

<P>ever see such roses?" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy

<P>the view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, nor felt such thorns," returned Laurie, with his thumb

<P>in his mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet

<P>flower that grew just beyond his reach.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns," said

<P>Amy, gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred

<P>the wall behind her.&nbsp; She put them in his buttonhole as a peace

<P>offering, and he stood a minute looking down at them with a

<P>curious expression, for in the Italian part of his nature there

<P>was a touch of superstition, and he was just then in that state

<P>of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy, when imaginative young

<P>men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere.

<P>He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for

<P>vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like that

<P>from the greenhouse at home.&nbsp; The pale roses Amy gave him were

<P>the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal

<P>wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or

<P>for himself, but the next instant his American common sense got

<P>the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh

<P>than Amy had heard since he came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,"

<P>she said, thinking her speech amused him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, I will," he answered in jest, and a few months

<P>later he did it in earnest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?" she asked

<P>presently, as she settled herself on a rustic seat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have said that a dozen times within the last three

<P>weeks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say, short answers save trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He expects you, and you really ought to go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hospitable creature!&nbsp; I know it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then why don't you do it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Natural depravity, I suppose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Natural indolence, you mean.&nbsp; It's really dreadful!"

<P>And Amy looked severe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I

<P>went, so I might as well stay and plague you a little longer,

<P>you can bear it better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently."

<P>And Laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an

<P>air of resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture

<P>`that boy' and in a minute she began again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you doing just now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Watching lizards."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no.&nbsp; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How provoking you are!&nbsp; I don't approve of cigars and I will only
allow

<P>it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.&nbsp; I need
a figure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"With all the pleasure in life.&nbsp; How will you have me, full

<P>length or three-quarters, on my head or my heels?&nbsp; I should

<P>respectfully suggest a recumbent posture, then put yourself

<P>in also and call it `Dolce far niente'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.&nbsp; I intend to

<P>work hard," said Amy in her most energetic tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What delightful enthusiasm!"&nbsp; And he leaned against a tall

<P>urn with an ir of entire satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What would Jo say if she saw you now?" asked Amy impatiently,

<P>hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more

<P>energetic sister's name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As usual, `Go away, Teddy.&nbsp; I'm busy!'" He laughed as he

<P>spoke, but the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over

<P>his face, for the utterance of the familiar name touched the

<P>wound that was not healed yet.&nbsp; Both tone and shadow struck Amy,

<P>for she had seen and heard them before, and now she looked up

<P>in time to catch a new expression on Laurie's face--a hard bitter

<P>look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and regret.&nbsp; It was gone before

<P>she could study it and the listless expression back again.

<P>She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure, thinking

<P>how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in the sun

<P>with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for

<P>he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his

<P>tomb," she said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined

<P>against the dark stone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wish I was!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life.

<P>You are so changed, I sometimes think--" There Amy stopped,

<P>with a half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her

<P>unfinished speech.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which

<P>she hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes,

<P>said, just as he used to say it to her mother, "It's all right, ma'am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun

<P>to worry her lately.&nbsp; It also touched her, and she showed

<P>that it did, by the cordial tone in which she said...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of that!&nbsp; I didn't think you'd been a very bad

<P>boy, but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked

<P>Baden-Baden, lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman

<P>with a husband, or got into some of the scrapes that young men

<P>seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour.&nbsp; Don't

<P>stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the grass here and

<P>`let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when we got in the sofa

<P>corner and told secrets."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and

<P>began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of

<P>Amy's hat, that lay there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm all ready for the secrets."&nbsp; And he glanced up with

<P>a decided expression of interest in his eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've none to tell.&nbsp; You may begin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Haven't one to bless myself with.&nbsp; I thought perhaps you'd

<P>had some news from home.."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have heard all that has come lately.&nbsp; Don't you hear

<P>often?&nbsp; I fancied Jo would send you volumes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's very busy.&nbsp; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to

<P>be regular, you know.&nbsp; When do you begin your great work of art,

<P>Raphaella?' he asked.&nbsp; changing the subject abruptly after

<P>another pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his

<P>secret and wanted to talk about it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air.

<P>"Rome took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the

<P>wonders there, I felt too insignificant to live and gave up

<P>all my foolish hopes in despair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no

<P>amount of energy can make it so.&nbsp; I want to be great, or nothing.

<P>I won't be a common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society,

<P>if I get the chance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but

<P>audacity becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good

<P>foundation.&nbsp; Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with

<P>which she took up a new purpose when a long-cherished one

<P>died, and spent no time lamenting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good!&nbsp; And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious

<P>look in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,

<P>"Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions.&nbsp; May I?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't promise to answer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your face will, if your tongue won't.&nbsp; You aren't woman of

<P>the world enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.&nbsp; I heard

<P>rumors about Fred and you last year, and it's my private opinion

<P>that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained

<P>so long, something would have come of it, hey?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's not for me to say," was Amy's grim reply, but her lips

<P>would smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye

<P>which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not engaged, I hope?" And Laurie looked very

<P>elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down

<P>on his knees, won't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very likely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then you are fond of old Fred?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I could be, if I tried."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless

<P>my soul, what unearthly prudence!&nbsp; He's a good fellow, Amy, but

<P>not the man I fancied you'd like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,"

<P>began Amy, trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling

<P>a little ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her

<P>intentions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I understand.&nbsp; Queens of society can't get on without money,

<P>so you mean to make a good match, and start in that way?&nbsp; Quite

<P>right and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the

<P>lips of one of your mother's girls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True, nevertheless."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was

<P>uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker.&nbsp; Laurie

<P>felt this instinctively and laid himself down again, with a

<P>sense of disappointment which he could not explain.&nbsp; His look

<P>and silence, as well as a certain inward self-disapproval,

<P>ruffled Amy, and made her resolve to deliver her lecture

<P>without delay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,"

<P>she said sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do it for me, there's a dear girl."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I could, if I tried."&nbsp; And she looked as if she would like

<P>doing it in the most summary style.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try, then.&nbsp; I give you leave," returned Laurie, who enjoyed

<P>having someone to tease, after his long abstinence from

<P>his favorite pastime.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd be angry in five minutes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm never angry with you.&nbsp; It takes two flints to make a fire.

<P>You are as cool and soft as snow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't know what I can do.&nbsp; Snow produces a glow and a tingle,

<P>if applied rightly.&nbsp; Your indifference is half affectation,

<P>and a good stirring up would prove it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the

<P>big man said when his little wife beat him.&nbsp; Regard me in the

<P>light of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired,

<P>if that sort of exercise agrees with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him

<P>shake off the apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both

<P>tongue and pencil, and began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Flo and I have got a new name for you.&nbsp; It's Lazy Laurence.

<P>How do you like it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his

<P>arms under his head, with an imperturbable, "That's not bad.

<P>Thank you, ladies."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pining to be told."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I despise you."

<P>If she had even said `I hate you' in a petulant or coquettish

<P>tone, he would have laughed and rather liked it, but

<P>the grave, almost sad, accent in her voice made him open his

<P>eyes, and ask quickly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, if you please?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and

<P>happy, you are faulty, lazy, and miserable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Strong language, mademoiselle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you like it, I'll go on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray do, it's quite interesting."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you'd find it so.&nbsp; Selfish people always like to

<P>talk about themselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Am I selfish?" The question slipped out involuntarily and

<P>in a tone of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided

<P>himself was generosity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very selfish," continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice,

<P>twice as effective just then as an angry one.&nbsp; "I'll show you

<P>how, for I've studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm

<P>not at all satisfied with you.&nbsp; Here you have been abroad

<P>nearly six months, and done nothing but waste time and money

<P>and disappoint your friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year

<P>grind?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't look as if you'd had much.&nbsp; At any rate, you are

<P>none the better for it, as far as I can see.&nbsp; I said when we

<P>first met that you had improved.&nbsp; Now I take it all back, for I

<P>don't think you half so nice as when I left you at home.&nbsp; You

<P>have grown abominably lazy, you like gossip, and waste time on

<P>frivolous things, you are contented to be petted and admired

<P>by silly people, instead of being loved and respected by wise

<P>ones.&nbsp; With money, talent, position, health, and beauty, ah

<P>you like that old Vanity!&nbsp; But it's the truth, so I can't help

<P>saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you

<P>can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man

<P>you ought to be, you are only..."&nbsp; There she stopped, with

<P>a look that had both pain and pity in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Saint Laurence on a gridiron," added Laurie, blandly

<P>finishing the sentence.&nbsp; But the lecture began to take effect,

<P>for there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a

<P>half-angry, half-injured expression replaced the former indifference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I supposed you'd take it so.&nbsp; You men tell us we are

<P>angels, and say we can make you what we will, but the instant

<P>we honestly try to do you good, you laugh at us and won't

<P>listen, which proves how much your flattery is worth." Amy

<P>spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the exasperating

<P>martyr at her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she

<P>could not draw, and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation

<P>of a penitent child, "I will be good, oh, I will be good!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping

<P>on the outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, "Aren't

<P>you ashamed of a hand like that?&nbsp; It's as soft and white as a

<P>woman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's

<P>best gloves and pick flowers for ladies.&nbsp; You are not a dandy,

<P>thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big

<P>seal rings on it, only the little old one Jo gave you so long

<P>ago.&nbsp; Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So do I!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was

<P>energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.&nbsp; She

<P>glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind, but he

<P>was lying with his hat half over his face, as if for shade, and

<P>his mustache hid his mouth.&nbsp; She only saw his chest rise and

<P>fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and the

<P>hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to

<P>hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of.

<P>All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and

<P>significance in Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never

<P>had confided to her.&nbsp; She remembered that Laurie never spoke

<P>voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on his face just

<P>now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the little

<P>old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand.&nbsp; Girls are

<P>quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.&nbsp; Amy had

<P>fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the

<P>alteration, and now she was sure of it.&nbsp; Her keen eyes filled,

<P>and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be

<P>beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if

<P>you weren't the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be

<P>very angry with me.&nbsp; But we are all so fond and proud of you,

<P>I couldn't bear to think they should be disappointed in you at

<P>home as I have been, though, perhaps they would understand

<P>the change better than I do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think they would," came from under the hat, in a grim

<P>tone, quite as touching as a broken one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering

<P>and scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient

<P>than ever.&nbsp; I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate

<P>her!" said artful Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hang Miss Randal!"&nbsp; And Laurie knocked the hat off his

<P>face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward

<P>that young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I beg pardon, I thought..."&nbsp; And there she paused

<P>diplomatically.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for

<P>anyone but Jo," Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone,

<P>and turned his face away as he spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it,

<P>and you came away, I supposed I was mistaken.&nbsp; And Jo wouldn't

<P>be kind to you?&nbsp; Why, I was sure she loved you dearly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for

<P>her she didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you

<P>think me.&nbsp; It's her fault though, and you may tell her so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and

<P>it troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was wrong, I didn't know.&nbsp; I'm very sorry I was so cross,

<P>but I can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't, that's her name for me!"&nbsp; And Laurie put up his

<P>hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's

<P>half-kind, half-reproachful tone.&nbsp; "Wait till you've tried it

<P>yourself," he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass

<P>by the handful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if i couldn't be

<P>loved," said Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing

<P>about it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably

<P>well, making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his

<P>trouble away to live it down alone.&nbsp; Amy's lecture put the

<P>Matter in a new light, and for the first time it did look

<P>weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure, and shut

<P>himself up in moody indifference.&nbsp; He felt as if suddenly

<P>shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go

<P>to sleep again.&nbsp; Presently he sat up and asked slowly, "Do

<P>you think Jo would despise me as you do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, if she saw you now.&nbsp; She hates lazy people.&nbsp; Why don't

<P>you do something splendid, and make her love you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did my best, but it was no use."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Graduating well, you mean?&nbsp; That was no more than you

<P>ought to have done, for your grandfather's sake.&nbsp; It would

<P>have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and

<P>money, when everyone knew that you could do well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>began Laurie, leaning his head on his hand in a despondent

<P>attitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did

<P>you good, and proved that you could do something if you tried.

<P>If you'd only set about another task of some sort, you'd soon

<P>be your hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's impossible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try it and see.&nbsp; You needn't shrug your shoulders, and

<P>think, `Much she knows about such things'.&nbsp; I don't pretend

<P>to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more

<P>than you'd imagine.&nbsp; I'm interested in other people's experiences

<P>and inconsistencies, and though I can't explain, I remember

<P>and use them for my own benefit.&nbsp; Love Jo all your days,

<P>if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's wicked

<P>to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the

<P>one you want.&nbsp; There, I won't lecture any more, for I know

<P>you'll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Neither spoke for several minutes.&nbsp; Laurie sat turning

<P>the little ring on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to

<P>the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked.

<P>Presently she put it on his knee, merely saying, "How do you

<P>like that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help

<P>doing, for it was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the

<P>grass, with listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding

<P>a cigar, from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled

<P>the dreamer's head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How well you draw!" he said, with a genuine surprise

<P>and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh,

<P>"Yes, that's me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As you are.&nbsp; This is as you were."&nbsp; And Amy laid another

<P>sketch beside the one he held.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and

<P>spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the

<P>past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young

<P>man's face as he looked.&nbsp; Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming

<P>a horse.&nbsp; Hat and coat were off, and every line of the active

<P>figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude was full of

<P>energy and meaning.&nbsp; The handsome brute, just subdued, stood

<P>arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot

<P>impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if

<P>listening for the voice that had mastered him.&nbsp; In the ruffled

<P>mane.&nbsp; The rider's breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a

<P>suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage,

<P>and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine

<P>grace of the `DOLCE FAR NIENTE' sketch.&nbsp; Laurie said nothing

<P>but as his eye went from one to the other, Amy say him flush

<P>up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the

<P>little lesson she had given him.&nbsp; That satisfied her, and

<P>without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly

<P>way...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck,

<P>and we all looked on?&nbsp; Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo

<P>clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you.&nbsp; I

<P>found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it

<P>up, and kept it to show you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Much obliged.&nbsp; You've improved immensely since then,

<P>and I congratulate you.&nbsp; May I venture to suggest in ` a

<P>honeymoon paradise' that five o'clock is the dinner hour at

<P>your hotel?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile

<P>and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that

<P>even moral lectures should have an end.&nbsp; He tried to resume his

<P>former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for

<P>the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess.&nbsp; Amy

<P>felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to herself .&nbsp;
..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, I've offended him.&nbsp; Well, if it does him good, I'm

<P>glad, if it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and

<P>I can't take back a word of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little

<P>Baptist, up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle

<P>were in charming spirits.&nbsp; But both felt ill at ease.&nbsp; The

<P>friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow

<P>over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret

<P>discontent in the heart of each.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?" asked Amy, as

<P>they parted at her aunt's door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Unfortunately I have an engagement.&nbsp; Au revoir, madamoiselle."

<P>And Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion,

<P>which became him better than many men.&nbsp; Something in his face

<P>made Amy say quickly and warmly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way.

<P>I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the

<P>sentimental salutations in France."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Goodbye, dear." And with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,

<P>Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a

<P>note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Dear Mentor,

<P>Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within

<P>yourself, for `Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like

<P>the best of boys.&nbsp; A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods

<P>grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa!&nbsp; I think Fred

<P>would be benefited by a rouser.&nbsp; Tell him so, with my congratulations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yours gratefully, Telemachus
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good boy!&nbsp; I'm glad he's gone," said Amy, with an approving smile.

<P>The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room,

<P>adding, with an involuntary sigh, "Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss
him."
