<P>"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled

<P>Jo, lying on the rug.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at

<P>her old dress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of

<P>pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy,

<P>with an injured sniff.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We've got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth

<P>contentedly from her corner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened

<P>at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,

<P>"We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time."

<P>She didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking

<P>of Father far away, where the fighting was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,

<P>"You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this

<P>Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone;

<P>and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when

<P>our men are suffering so in the army.&nbsp; We can't do much, but we
can

<P>make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly.&nbsp; But I am

<P>afraid I don't."&nbsp; And Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully

<P>of all the pretty things she wanted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any

<P>good.&nbsp; We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped

<P>by our giving that.&nbsp; I agree not to expect anything from Mother
or

<P>you, but I do want to buy UNDINE AND SINTRAM for myself.&nbsp; I've

<P>wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a

<P>little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle

<P>holder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils.&nbsp; I

<P>really need them," said Amy decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't

<P>wish us to give up everything.&nbsp; Let's each buy what we want, and

<P>have a little fun.&nbsp; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried

<P>Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all

<P>day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the

<P>complaining tone again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo.

<P>"How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy

<P>old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries

<P>you till you you're ready to fly out the window or cry?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and

<P>keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world.&nbsp; It makes me

<P>cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all."

<P>And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could

<P>hear that time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for

<P>you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague

<P>you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and

<P>label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose

<P>isn't nice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as

<P>if Papa was a pickle bottle," advised Jo, laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it.

<P>It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,"

<P>returned Amy, with dignity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't peck at one another, children.&nbsp; Don't you wish we

<P>had the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo?&nbsp; Dear me! How

<P>happy and good we'd be, if we had no worries!" said Meg, who

<P>could remember better times.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier

<P>than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all

<P>the time, in spite of their money."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I did, Beth.&nbsp; Well, I think we are.&nbsp; For though we do

<P>have to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly

<P>set, as Jo would say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo does use such slang words!" observed Amy, with a

<P>reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and

<P>began to whistle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't, Jo.&nbsp; It's so boyish!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's why I do it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I detest rude, unladylike girls!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Birds in their little nests agree," sang Beth, the

<P>peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices

<P>softened to a laugh, and the "pecking" ended for that time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg,

<P>beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion."You are old

<P>enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better,

<P>Josephine.&nbsp; It didn't matter so much when you were a little

<P>girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should

<P>remember that you are a young lady."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not!&nbsp;&nbsp; And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll

<P>wear it in two tails till I'm twenty," cried Jo, pulling off

<P>her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane.&nbsp; "I hate to think

<P>I've got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns,

<P>and look as prim as a China Aster!&nbsp; It's bad enough to be a

<P>girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and manners!&nbsp; I

<P>can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy.&nbsp; And it's

<P>worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa.

<P>And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled

<P>like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Jo!&nbsp; It's too bad, but it can't be helped.&nbsp; So you

<P>must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and

<P>playing brother to us girls," said Beth, stroking the rough

<P>head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the

<P>world could not make ungentle in its touch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As for you, Amy," continued Meg, "you are altogether

<P>to particular and prim.&nbsp; Your airs are funny now, but you'll

<P>grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care.&nbsp; I

<P>I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when

<P>you don't try to be elegant.&nbsp; But your absurd words are as bad

<P>as Jo's slang."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?"

<P>asked Beth, ready to share the lecture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're a dear, and nothing else," answered Meg warmly,

<P>and no one contradicted her, for the `Mouse' was the pet of the

<P>family.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As young readers like to know `how people look', we will

<P>take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four

<P>sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the

<P>December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled

<P>cheerfully within.&nbsp; It was a comfortable room, though the carpet

<P>was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or

<P>two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums

<P>and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant

<P>atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty,

<P>being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a

<P>sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain.&nbsp; Fifteen-

<P>year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a

<P>colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs,

<P>which were very much in her way.&nbsp; She had a decided mouth, a comical

<P>nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and

<P>were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful.&nbsp; Her long, thick hair

<P>was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be

<P>out of her way.&nbsp; Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet,

<P>a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of

<P>a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it.

<P>Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-

<P>haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid

<P>voice, and a ;peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed.&nbsp;
Her

<P>father called her `Little Miss Tranquility', and the name suited

<P>her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her

<P>own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.

<P>Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own

<P>opinion at least.&nbsp; A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and

<P>yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always

<P>carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.&nbsp; What

<P>the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth

<P>put a pair of slippers down to warm.&nbsp; Somehow the sight of the
old

<P>shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and

<P>everyone brightened to welcome her.&nbsp; Meg stopped lecturing, and

<P>lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked,

<P>and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers

<P>nearer to the blaze.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are quite worn out.&nbsp; Marmee must have a new pair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar," said Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I shall!" cried Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm the oldest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided,

<P>"I'm the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide

<P>the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while

<P>he was gone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll tell you what we'll do," said Beth, "let's each get her

<P>something for Christmas, land not get anything for ourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's like you, dear!&nbsp; What will we get?" exclaimed Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as

<P>if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands,

<P>"I shall give her a nice pair of gloves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Army shoes, best to be had," cried Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed," said Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll get a little bottle of cologne.&nbsp; She likes it, and it won't

<P>cost much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils," added Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How will we give the things?" asked Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open

<P>the bundles.&nbsp; Don't you remember how we used to do on our

<P>birthdays?" answered Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the

<P>chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to

<P>give the presents, with a kiss.&nbsp; I liked the things and the kisses,

<P>but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened

<P>the bundles," said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread

<P>for tea at the same time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and

<P>then surprise her.&nbsp; We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg.

<P>There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night," said

<P>Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her

<P>nose in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't mean to act any more after this time.&nbsp; I'm getting

<P>too old for such things," observed Meg, who was as much a child

<P>as ever about `dressing-up' frolics.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a

<P>white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry.

<P>You are the best actress we've got, and there'll be an end

<P>of everything if you quit the boards," said Jo.&nbsp; "We ought

<P>to rehearse tonight.&nbsp; Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene,

<P>for you are as stiff as a poker in that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't help it.&nbsp; I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose

<P>to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.&nbsp; If
I

<P>can go down easily, I'll drop.&nbsp; If I can't, I shall fall into a

<P>chair and be graceful.&nbsp; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with

<P>a pistol," returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power,

<P>but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking

<P>by the villain of the piece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do it this way.&nbsp; Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the

<P>room, crying frantically, `Roderigo Save me! Save me!' and away

<P>went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her,

<P>and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her "Ow!"

<P>was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and

<P>anguish.&nbsp; Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright,

<P>while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest.

<P>"It's no use!&nbsp; Do the best you can when the time comes, and if

<P>the audience laughs, don't blame me.&nbsp; Come on, Meg."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in

<P>a speech of two pages without a single break.&nbsp; Hagar, the witch,

<P>chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads,

<P>with weird effect.&nbsp; Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully,
and

<P>Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, "Ha! Ha!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's the best we've had yet," said Meg, as the dead villain

<P>sat up and rubbed his elbows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things,

<P>Jo.&nbsp; You're a regular Shakespeare!" exclaimed Beth, who firmly

<P>believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all

<P>things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite," replied Jo modestly.&nbsp; "I do think THE WITCHES CURSE,

<P>an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try

<P>McBETH, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.&nbsp; I always wanted
to

<P>do the killing part.&nbsp; `Is that a dagger that I see before me?"

<P>muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had

<P>seen a famous tragedian do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead

<P>of the bread.&nbsp; Beth's stage-struck!" cried Meg, and the rehearsal

<P>ended in a general burst of laughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Glad to find you so merry, my girls," said a cheery voice at

<P>the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly

<P>lady with a `can I help you' look about her which was truly delightful.

<P>She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the

<P>girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most

<P>splendid mother in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, dearies, how have you got on today?&nbsp; There was so much to

<P>do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home

<P>to dinner.&nbsp; Has anyone called, Beth?&nbsp; How is your cold, Meg?&nbsp;
Jo,

<P>you look tired to death.&nbsp; Come and kiss me, baby."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet

<P>things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy

<P>chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour

<P>of her busy day.&nbsp; The girls flew about, trying to make things

<P>comfortable, each in her own way.&nbsp; Meg arranged the tea table,
Jo

<P>brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering

<P>everything she touched.&nbsp; Beth trotted to and fro between parlor

<P>kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as

<P>she sat with her hands folded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a

<P>particularly happy face, "I've got a treat for you after supper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine.

<P>Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held,

<P>and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, "A letter!&nbsp; A letter!&nbsp;
Three

<P>cheers for Father!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, a nice long letter.&nbsp; He is well, and thinks he shall

<P>get through the cold season better than we feared.&nbsp; He sends all

<P>sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message

<P>to you girls," said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she

<P>had got a treasure there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hurry and get done!&nbsp; Don't stop to quirk your little finger

<P>and simper over your plate, Amy," cried Jo, choking on her tea

<P>and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her

<P>haste to get at the treat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner

<P>and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain

<P>when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for

<P>a soldier," said Meg warmly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what's its

<P>name?&nbsp; Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him," exclaimed

<P>Jo, with a groan.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat

<P>all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,"

<P>sighed Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When will he come home, Marmee?&nbsp; asked Beth, with a little

<P>quiver in her voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.&nbsp; He will stay

<P>and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask

<P>for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared.&nbsp; Now come and

<P>hear the letter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth

<P>at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and

<P>Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion

<P>if the letter should happen to be touching.&nbsp; Very few letters were

<P>written in those hard times that were not touching, especially

<P>those which fathers sent home.&nbsp; In this one little was said of
the

<P>hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered.

<P>It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions

<P>of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at the end

<P>did the writer's heart over-flow with fatherly love and longing

<P>for the little girls at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.&nbsp; Tell them I think

<P>of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort

<P>in their affection at all times.&nbsp; A year seems very long to wait

<P>before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all

<P>work, so that these hard days need not be wasted.&nbsp; I know they
will

<P>remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to

<P>you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely,

<P>and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them

<P>I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women."

<P>Everybody sniffed when they came to that part.&nbsp; Jo wasn't

<P>ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and

<P>Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on

<P>her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, "I am a selfish girl!&nbsp; But

<P>I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in me

<P>by-and-by."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We all will," cried Meg.&nbsp; "I think too much of my looks and

<P>hate to work, but won't any more, if I can help it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, `a little woman'

<P>and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting

<P>to be somewhere else," said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper

<P>at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army

<P>sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing

<P>the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet

<P>little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year

<P>brought round the happy coming home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by

<P>saying in her cheery voice, "Do you remember how you used to play

<P>Pilgrims Progress when you were little things?&nbsp; Nothing delighted

<P>you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens,

<P>give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel

<P>through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction,

<P>up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you

<P>could collect to make a Celestial City."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting

<P>Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob-goblins

<P>were," said Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled

<P>downstairs," said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of

<P>the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk

<P>we had up at the top.&nbsp; If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd

<P>rather like to play it over again," said Amy, who began to talk

<P>of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play

<P>we are playing all the time in one way or another.&nbsp; Out burdens
are

<P>here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and

<P>happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and

<P>mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City.&nbsp; Now, my
little

<P>pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest,

<P>and see how far on you can get before Father comes home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Really, Mother?&nbsp; Where are our bundles?" asked Amy, who was

<P>a very literal young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth.

<P>I rather think she hasn't got any," said her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I have.&nbsp; Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls

<P>with nice pianos, and being afraid of people."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to

<P>laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very

<P>much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let us do it," said Meg thoughtfully.&nbsp; "It is only another

<P>name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though

<P>we do want to be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do

<P>our best."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came

<P>and pulled us out as Help did in the book.&nbsp; We ought to have our

<P>roll of directions, like Christian.&nbsp; What shall we do about that?"

<P>asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to

<P>the very dull task of doing her duty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look under your pillows christmas morning, and you will

<P>find your guidebook," replied Mrs. March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the

<P>table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the needles

<P>flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March.&nbsp; It was uninteresting

<P>sewing, but tonight no one grumbled.&nbsp; They adopted Jo's plan of

<P>dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters

<P>Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally,

<P>especially when they talked about the different countries as they

<P>stitched their way through them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they

<P>went to bed.&nbsp; No one but Beth could get much music out of the old

<P>piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and

<P>making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.&nbsp;
Meg

<P>had a voice like a flute, and she and herr mother led the little

<P>choir.&nbsp; Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the
airs

<P>at her own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a

<P>croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune.&nbsp; They had

<P>always done this from the time they could lisp...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born

<P>singer.&nbsp; The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went

<P>about the house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night

<P>was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for

<P>that familiar lullaby.
