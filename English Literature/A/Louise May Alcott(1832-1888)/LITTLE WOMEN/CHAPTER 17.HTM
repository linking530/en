<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have

<P>supplied the neighborhood.&nbsp; It was really amazing, for everyone

<P>seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the

<P>fashion.&nbsp; Relieved of their first anxiety about their father,

<P>girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little,

<P>and began to fall back into old ways.&nbsp; They did not forget

<P>their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier,

<P>and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor

<P>deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn

<P>head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better,

<P>for Aunt March didn't like to hear people read with colds in

<P>their heads.&nbsp; Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from

<P>garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with

<P>arsenicum and books.&nbsp; Amy found that housework and art did not

<P>go well together, and returned to her mud pies.&nbsp; Meg went daily

<P>to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much

<P>time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading

<P>the Washington dispatches over and over.&nbsp; Beth kept on, with only

<P>slight relapses into idleness or grieving.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and

<P>many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house

<P>seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.&nbsp; When her

<P>heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she

<P>went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a

<P>dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little

<P>prayer quietly by herself.&nbsp; Nobody knew what cheered her up after

<P>a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and

<P>fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their

<P>small affairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All were unconscious that this experience was a test of

<P>character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they

<P>had done well and deserved praise.&nbsp; So they did, but their

<P>mistake was in ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson

<P>through much anxiety and regret.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels.&nbsp; You know Mother

<P>told us not to forget them." said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's

<P>departure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm too tired to go this afternoon," re;lied Meg, rocking

<P>comfortably as she sewed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can't you, Jo?' asked Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Too stormy for me with my cold."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought it was almost well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well

<P>enough to go to the Hummels'," said Jo, laughing, but looking a

<P>little ashamed of her inconsistency.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why don't you go yourself?" asked Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't

<P>know what to do for it.&nbsp; Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and

<P>Lottchen takes care of it.&nbsp; But it gets sicker and sicker,

<P>and I think you or Hannah ought to go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth,

<P>the air will do you good," said Jo, adding apologetically, "I'd go

<P>but I want to finish my writing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you

<P>would go," said Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,

<P>suggested Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work,

<P>and the Hummels were forgotten.&nbsp; An hour passed.&nbsp; Amy did
not come,

<P>Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her

<P>story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when

<P>Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends

<P>for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy

<P>head and a grieved look in her patient eyes.&nbsp; It was late when
she

<P>came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into

<P>her mother's room.&nbsp; Half an hour after, Jo went to `Mother's closet'

<P>for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine

<P>chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in

<P>her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Christopher Columbus!&nbsp; What's the matter?" cried Jo, as Beth

<P>put out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly, "You've

<P>had the scarlet fever, havent't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Years ago, when Meg did.&nbsp; Why?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I'll tell you.&nbsp; Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What baby?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Hummel's.&nbsp; It died in my lap before she got home," cried

<P>Beth with a sob.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My poor dear, how dreadful for you!&nbsp; I ought to have gone,"

<P>said Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her

<P>mother's bit chair, with a remorseful face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad!&nbsp; I saw in a minute it

<P>was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so

<P>I took Baby and let Lotty rest.&nbsp; It seemed asleep, but all of a

<P>sudden if gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still.

<P>I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't

<P>stir, and I knew it was dead."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't cry, dear!&nbsp; What did you do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the

<P>doctor.&nbsp; He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna,
who

<P>have sore throats.&nbsp; `Scarlet fever, ma'am.&nbsp; Ought to have
called me

<P>before, ' he said crossly.&nbsp; Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor,
and

<P>had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she

<P>could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his

<P>pay.&nbsp; He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and
I

<P>cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me

<P>to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the fever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, you won't!" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened

<P>look.&nbsp; "Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself!

<P>What shall we do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly.&nbsp; I looked

<P>in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat,

<P>and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I

<P>feel better," said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead

<P>and trying to look well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Mother was only at home!" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book,

<P>and feeling that Washington was an immense way off.&nbsp; She read a
page,

<P>looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then

<P>said gravely, "You've been over the baby every day for more than a

<P>week, and among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid

<P>you are going to have it, Beth.&nbsp; I'll call Hannah, she knows all

<P>about sickness."

<P>"Don't let Amy come.&nbsp; She never had it, and I should hate to

<P>give it to her.&nbsp; Can't you and Meg have it over again?" asked Beth,

<P>anxiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I guess not.&nbsp; Don't care if I do.&nbsp; Serve me right, selfish
pig,

<P>to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!" muttered Jo, as she

<P>went to consult Hannah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at

<P>once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet

<P>fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed,

<P>and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I'll tell you what we'll do," said Hannah, when she had

<P>examined and questioned Beth, "we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take

<P>a look at you, dear, and see that we start right.&nbsp; Then we'll send

<P>Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way,

<P>and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest," began Meg, looking anxious

<P>and self-reproachful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall, because it's my fault she is sick.&nbsp; I told Mother I'd

<P>do the errands, and I haven't," said Jo decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which will you have, Beth?&nbsp; There ain't no need of but one,"

<P>aid Hannah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo, please." And Beth leaned her head against her sister with

<P>a contented look, which effectually settled that point.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll go and tell Amy," said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet

<P>rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo

<P>did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had

<P>rather have the fever than go to Aunt March.&nbsp; Meg reasoned, pleaded,

<P>and commanded, all in vain.&nbsp; Amy protested that she would not go,

<P>and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.&nbsp;
Before

<P>she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with

<P>her head in the sofa cushions.&nbsp; She told her story, expecting to
be

<P>consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked

<P>about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep

<P>thought.&nbsp; Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most

<P>wheedlesome tone, "Now be a sensible little woman, and do as they say.

<P>No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got.&nbsp; You go to
Aunt

<P>March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, driving or walking,

<P>and we'll have capital times.&nbsp; Won't that be better than moping
here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy,

<P>in an injured voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well.&nbsp; You don't

<P>want to be sick, do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been

<P>with Beth all the time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that

<P>you may escape it.&nbsp; Change of air and care will keep you well,
I

<P>dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more

<P>lightly.&nbsp; I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet
fever

<P>is no joke, miss."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross," said Amy,

<P>looking rather frightened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It won't be dull with me popping; in every day to tell you how

<P>Beth is, and take you out gallivanting.&nbsp; The old lady likes me,
and

<P>I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us,

<P>whatever we do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On my honor as a gentleman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And come every single day?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"See if I don't/"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The identical minute."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And go to the theater, truly?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A dozen theaters, if we may."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--I guess I will," said Amy slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good girl!&nbsp; Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in," said

<P>Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the

<P>`giving in'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had

<P>been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing,

<P>promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is the little dear?" asked Laurie, for Beth was his

<P>especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to

<P>show.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better.&nbsp; The

<P>baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold.

<P>Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me

<P>fidgety," answered Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a trying world it is!" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in

<P>a fretful way.&nbsp; "No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down

<P>comes another.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to

<P>when Mother's gone, so I'm all at sea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming.

<P>Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother,

<P>or do anything?" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the

<P>loss of his friend's one beauty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is what troubles me," said Meg.&nbsp; "I think we ought to tell

<P>her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother

<P>can't leave Father, and it will only make them anxious.&nbsp; Beth won't

<P>be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we

<P>were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite

<P>right to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hum, well, I can't say.&nbsp; Suppose you ask Grandfather after

<P>the doctor has been."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We will.&nbsp; Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once," commanded Meg.

<P>"We can't decide anything till he has been."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stay where you are, Jo.&nbsp; I'm errand boy to this establishment,"

<P>said Laurie, taking up his cap.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid you are busy," began Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I've done my lessons for the day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you study in vacation time?" asked Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I follow the good example my neighbors set me," was Laurie's

<P>answer, as he swung himself out of the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have great hopes for my boy," observed Jo, watching him

<P>fly over the fence with an approving smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He does very well, for a boy," was Meg's somewhat ungracious

<P>answer, for the subject did not interest her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought

<P>she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.

<P>Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward

<P>off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you want now?" she asked, looking sharply over her

<P>spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair,

<P>called out...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go away.&nbsp; No boys allowed here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking

<P>about among poor folks.&nbsp; Amy can stay and make herself useful

<P>if she isn't sick, which I've no doubt she will be, looks like

<P>it now.&nbsp; Don't cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff."

<P>Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the

<P>parrot's tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and

<P>call out, "Bless my boots!" in such a funny way, that she laughed

<P>instead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you hear from your mother?" asked the old lady

<P>gruffly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Father is much better," replied Jo, trying to keep sober.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, is her?&nbsp; Well, that won't last long, I fancy.&nbsp; March

<P>never had any stamina," was the cheerful reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ha, ha!&nbsp; Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!"

<P>squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old

<P>lady's cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!&nbsp; And, Jo, you'd

<P>better go at once.&nbsp; It isn't proper to be gadding about so late
with

<P>a rattlepated boy like..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!" cried Polly,

<P>tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the

<P>`rattlepated' boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try," thought Amy, as

<P>she was left alone with Aunt March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Get along, you fright!" screamed Polly, and at that rude speech

<P>Amy could not restrain a sniff.
