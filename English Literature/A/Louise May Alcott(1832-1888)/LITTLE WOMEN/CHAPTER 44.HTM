<P>"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half

<P>an hour?&nbsp; The luggage has come, and I've been making hay of

<P>Amy's Paris finery, trying to find some things I want," said

<P>Laurie, coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting

<P>in her mother's lap, as if being made `the baby' again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but

<P>this." And Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding

<P>ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it, but

<P>I can't get on without my little woman any more than a..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Weathercock can without the wind," suggested Jo, as he

<P>paused for a simile.&nbsp; Jo had grown quite her own saucy self

<P>again since Teddy came home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the

<P>time, with only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and

<P>I haven't had an easterly spell since I was married.&nbsp; Don't know

<P>anything about the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy,

<P>hey, my lady?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lovely weather so far.&nbsp; I don't know how long it will last,

<P>but I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my

<P>ship.&nbsp; Come home, dear, and I'll find your bootjack.&nbsp; I suppose

<P>that's what you are rummaging after among my things.&nbsp; Men are so

<P>helpless, Mother," said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted

<P>her husband.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?"

<P>asked Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have our plans.&nbsp; We don't mean to say much about them

<P>yet, because we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to

<P>be idle.&nbsp; I'm going into business with a devotion that shall delight

<P>Grandfather, and prove to him that I'm not spoiled.&nbsp; I need

<P>something of the sort to keep me steady.&nbsp; I'm tired of dawdling,

<P>and mean to work like a man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And Amy, what is she going to do?" asked Mrs. March, well

<P>pleased at Laurie's decision and the energy with which he spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet,

<P>we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion,

<P>the brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial

<P>influence we shall exert over the world at large.&nbsp; That's about

<P>it, isn't it, Madame Recamier?" asked Laurie with a quizzical

<P>look at Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Time will show.&nbsp; Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock

<P>my family by calling me names before their faces," answered Amy,

<P>resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it

<P>before she set up a salon as a queen of society.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How happy those children seem together!" observed Mr. March,

<P>finding it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after

<P>the young couple had gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and I think it will last," added Mrs. March, with the

<P>restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into

<P>port.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know it will.&nbsp; Happy Amy!"&nbsp; And Jo sighed, then smiled

<P>brightly as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient

<P>push.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest

<P>about the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, "Mrs.

<P>Laurence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My Lord!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That man intends to marry our Jo!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope so, don't you, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense

<P>of that expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger

<P>and a good deal richer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded.

<P>If they love one another it doesn't matter a particle how old

<P>they are nor how poor.&nbsp; Women never should marry for money..."

<P>Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked

<P>at her husband, who replied, with malicious gravity...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that

<P>they intend to do it sometimes.&nbsp; If my memory serves me, you

<P>once thought it your duty to make a rich match.&nbsp; That accounts,

<P>perhaps, for your marrying a good-for-nothing like me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that!&nbsp; I forgot you

<P>were rich when I said `Yes'.&nbsp; I'd have married you if you hadn't

<P>a penny, and I sometimes wish you were poor that I might show

<P>how much I love you."&nbsp; And Amy, who was very dignified in public

<P>and very fond in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of

<P>her words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as

<P>I tried to be once, do you?&nbsp; It would break my heart if you

<P>didn't believe that I'd gladly pull in the same boat with you,

<P>even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake."2
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Am I an idiot and a brute?&nbsp; How could I think so, when

<P>you refused a richer man for me, and won't let me give you half

<P>I want to now, when I have the right?&nbsp; Girls do it every day,

<P>poor things, and are taught to think it is their only salvation,

<P>but you had better lessons, and though I trembled for you at

<P>one time, I was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to

<P>the mother's teaching.&nbsp; I told Mamma so yesterday, and she

<P>looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a

<P>million, to be spent in charity.&nbsp; You are not listening to my

<P>moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence."&nbsp; And Laurie paused, for Amy's

<P>eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I am, and admiring the mple in your chin at the

<P>same time.&nbsp; I don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess

<P>that I'm prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money.

<P>Don't laugh, but your nose is such a comfort to me." And Amy

<P>softly caressed the well-cut feature with artistic satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never

<P>one that suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did

<P>laugh at his wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, "May

<P>I ask you a question, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course, you may."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, that's the trouble is it?&nbsp; I thought there was something

<P>in the dimple that didn't quite suit you.&nbsp; Not being a dog in the

<P>manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance

<P>at Jo's wedding with a heart as light as my heels.&nbsp; Do you doubt

<P>it, my darling?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied.&nbsp; Her little jealous

<P>fear vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of

<P>love and confidence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor.

<P>Couldn't we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out

<P>there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" said Laurie,

<P>when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in

<P>arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.&nbsp; She is very proud

<P>of him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty

<P>was a beautiful thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless her dear heart!&nbsp; She won't think so when she has a

<P>literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins

<P>to support.&nbsp; We won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and

<P>do them a good turn in spite of themselves.&nbsp; I owe Jo for a part

<P>of my education, and she believes in people's paying their honest

<P>debts, so I'll get round her in that way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it?

<P>That was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving

<P>freely, and thanks to you, the dream has come true."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we?&nbsp; There's one

<P>sort of poverty that I particularly like to help.&nbsp; Out-and-out

<P>beggars get taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly,

<P>because they won't ask, and people don't dare to offer charity.

<P>Yet there are a thousand ways of helping them, if one only

<P>knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend.&nbsp; I

<P>must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a

<P>blarnerying beggar.&nbsp; I suppose it's wrong, but I do, though it

<P>is harder."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because it takes a gentleman to do it," added the other

<P>member of the domestic admiration society.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment.

<P>But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I

<P>saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices,

<P>and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams.

<P>Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros,&nbsp; poor

<P>and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition

<P>that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right

<P>good lift.&nbsp; Those are people whom it's a satisfaction to help,

<P>for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be allowed to

<P>serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel

<P>to keep the pot boiling.&nbsp; If they haven't, it's a pleasure to

<P>comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find

<P>it out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and

<P>who suffer in silence.&nbsp; I know something of it, for I belonged
to

<P>it before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid

<P>in the old story.&nbsp; Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie,

<P>and often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities

<P>go by, just for want of a little help at the right minute.&nbsp; People

<P>have been very kind to me, and whenever I see girls struggling

<P>along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them,

<P>as I was helped."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!" cried Laurie,

<P>resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow

<P>an institution for the express benefit of young women with

<P>artistic tendencies.&nbsp; "Rich people have no right to sit down

<P>and enjoy themselves, or let their money accumulate for others

<P>to waste.&nbsp; It's not half so sensible to leave legacies when one

<P>dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy

<P>making one's fellow creatures happy with it.&nbsp; We'll have a good

<P>time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by

<P>giving other people a generous taste.&nbsp; Will you be a little

<P>Dorcal, going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and

<P>filling it up with good deeds?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin,

<P>stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your

<P>cloak with the beggar."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced

<P>happily on again, feeling that their pleasant home was more

<P>homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes, believing

<P>that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery

<P>path before them, if they smoothed rough ways for other feet,

<P>and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together

<P>by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they.
