<P>When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with

<P>the change in Beth.&nbsp; No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it,

<P>for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her

<P>daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and

<P>a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she saw her sister's face.

<P>It was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet

<P>there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal

<P>was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through

<P>the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.&nbsp; Jo saw

<P>and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first

<P>impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no

<P>one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in

<P>other cares Jo fora time forgot her fear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the

<P>vague anxiety returned and haunted her.&nbsp; She had confessed

<P>her sins and been forgiven, but when she showed her savings

<P>and proposed a mountain trip, Beth had thanked her heartily,

<P>but begged not to go so far away from home.&nbsp; Another little

<P>visit to the seashore would suit her better, and as Grandma

<P>could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth

<P>down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the

<P>open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color

<P>into her pale cheeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant

<P>people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for

<P>one another.&nbsp; Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too

<P>wrapped up in her to care for anyone else.&nbsp; So they were all in

<P>all to each other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the

<P>interest they exited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic

<P>eyes the strong sister and the feeble one, always

<P>together, as if they felt instinctively that a long separation

<P>was not far away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between

<P>ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve

<P>which it is very hard to overcome.&nbsp; Jo felt as if a veil

<P>had fallen between her heart and Beth's, but when she put out

<P>her hand to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the

<P>silence, and she waited for Beth to speak.&nbsp; She wondered, and

<P>was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see what

<P>she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so

<P>plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing

<P>that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better.

<P>She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard

<P>truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during

<P>the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in

<P>Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea

<P>made music at her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One day Beth told her.&nbsp; Jo thought she was asleep, she lay

<P>so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with

<P>wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on

<P>Beth's cheeks.&nbsp; But she could not find enough to satisfy her,

<P>for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble

<P>to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting.

<P>It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was

<P>slowly drifting away form her, and her arms instinctively

<P>tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed.

<P>For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they

<P>cleared, Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was

<P>hardly any need for her to say, "Jo, dear, I'm glad you know

<P>it.&nbsp; I've tried to tell you, but I couldn't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her

<P>own, not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not

<P>cry.&nbsp; She was the weaker then, land Beth tried to comfort and

<P>sustain her, with her arms about her and the soothing words

<P>she whispered in her ear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used

<P>to it, it isn't hard to think of or to bear.&nbsp; Try to see it so

<P>and don't be troubled about me, because it's best, indeed it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You

<P>did not feel it then, land keep it to yourself so long, did you?"

<P>asked Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best, but glad to

<P>know that Laurie had no part in Beth's trouble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it.

<P>I tried to think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it

<P>trouble anyone.&nbsp; But when I saw you all so well and strong and

<P>full of happy plans, it was hard to feel that I could never be

<P>like you, and then I was miserable, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and

<P>help you?&nbsp; How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached

<P>to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while

<P>Beth learned to say goodbye to health, love, and live, and take

<P>up her cross so cheerfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.&nbsp; I wasn't sure,

<P>no one said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken.&nbsp; It would have

<P>been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about

<P>Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought

<P>so then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because

<P>I couldn't," cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite

<P>of her pain, and added softly, "Then you didn't, dearie? I was

<P>afraid it was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of

<P>lovelornity all that while."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?" asked

<P>Beth, as innocently as a child.&nbsp; "I do love him dearly.&nbsp; He
is

<P>so good to me, how can I help It?&nbsp; But he could never be anything

<P>to me but my brother.&nbsp; I hope he truly will be, sometime."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not through me," said Jo decidedly.&nbsp; "Amy is left for him,

<P>and they would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such

<P>things, now.&nbsp; I don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth.

<P>You must get well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want to, oh, so much!&nbsp; I try, but every day I lose a little,

<P>and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back.&nbsp; It's like
the

<P>tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen

<P>is too young, Beth.&nbsp; I can't let you go.&nbsp; I'll work and pray

<P>and fight against it.&nbsp; I'll keep you in spite of everything.&nbsp;
There

<P>must be ways, it can't be too late.&nbsp; God won't be so cruel as to

<P>take you from me," cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was

<P>far less piously submissive than Beth's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.&nbsp; It

<P>shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence

<P>than homilies or protestations.&nbsp; Beth could not reason upon or

<P>explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up

<P>life, and cheerfully wait for death.&nbsp; Like a confiding child, she

<P>asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father

<P>and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only,

<P>could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and

<P>the life to come.&nbsp; She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches,

<P>only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung

<P>more closely to the dear human love, from which our Father never

<P>means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us closer to

<P>Himself.&nbsp; She could not say, "I'm glad to go," for life was very

<P>sweet for her.&nbsp; She could only sob out, "I try to be willing,"

<P>while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this

<P>great sorrow broke over them together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, "You'll tell

<P>them this when we go home?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think they will see it without words," sighed Jo, for now

<P>it seemed to her that Beth changed every day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps not.&nbsp; I've heard that the people who love best are

<P>often blindest to such things.&nbsp; If they don't see it, you will
tell

<P>them for me.&nbsp; I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare

<P>them.&nbsp; Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must

<P>stand by Father and Mother, won't you Jo?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I can.&nbsp; But, Beth, I don't give up yet.&nbsp; I'm going to
believe

<P>that it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true."

<P>said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way,

<P>"I don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone

<P>but you, because I can't speak out except to my Jo.&nbsp; I only mean

<P>to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should

<P>live long.&nbsp; I'm not like the rest of you.&nbsp; I never made any
plans

<P>about what I'd do when I grew up.&nbsp; I never thought of being married,

<P>as you all did.&nbsp; I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything

<P>but stupid little Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere

<P>but there.&nbsp; I never wanted to go away, and the hard part now is

<P>the leaving you all.&nbsp; I'm not afraid, but it seems as if I should

<P>be homesick for you even in heaven."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no

<P>sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.&nbsp; A

<P>white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its

<P>silvery breast.&nbsp; Beth watched it till it vanished, and her eyes

<P>were full of sadness.&nbsp; A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping

<P>over the beach `peeping' softly to itself, as if enjoying

<P>the sun and sea.&nbsp; It came quite close to Beth, and looked at her

<P>with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone, dressing its wet

<P>feathers, quite at home.&nbsp; Beth smiled and felt comforted, for

<P>the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind

<P>her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear little bird!&nbsp; See, Jo, how tame it is.&nbsp; I like peeps

<P>better than the gulls.&nbsp; They are not so wild and handsome, but

<P>they seem happy, confiding little things.&nbsp; I used to call them

<P>my birds last summer, and Mother said they reminded her of me

<P>--busy, quaker-colored creatures, always near the shore, and

<P>always chirping that contented little song of theirs.&nbsp; You are

<P>the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind,

<P>flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.&nbsp; Meg is the turtledove,

<P>and Amy is like the lark she write about, trying to get

<P>up among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest

<P>again.&nbsp; Dear little girl!&nbsp; She's so ambitious, but her heart
is

<P>good and tender, and no matter how high she flies, she never

<P>will forget home.&nbsp; I hope I shall see her again, but she seems

<P>so far away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be

<P>all ready to see and enjoy her.&nbsp; I'm going to have you well and

<P>rosy by that time." began Jo, feeling that of all the changes

<P>in Beth, the talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to

<P>cost no effort now, and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike

<P>bashful Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo, dear, don't hope any more.&nbsp; It won't do any good.&nbsp; I'm

<P>sure of that.&nbsp; We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together

<P>while we wait.&nbsp; We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much,

<P>and I think the tide will go out easily, if you help me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that

<P>silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was right.&nbsp; There was no need of any words when they

<P>got home, for Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had

<P>prayed to be saved from seeing.&nbsp; Tired with her short journey,

<P>Beth went at once to bed, saying how glad she was to be home,

<P>and when Jo went down, she found that she would be spared the

<P>hard task of telling Beth's secret.&nbsp; Her father stood leaning

<P>his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in,

<P>but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo

<P>went to comfort her without a word.
