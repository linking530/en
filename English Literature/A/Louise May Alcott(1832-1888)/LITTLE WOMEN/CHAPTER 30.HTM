<P>Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it

<P>was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood

<P>to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interest

<P>in the matter.&nbsp; Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was

<P>fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly

<P>akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard

<P>knocks to teach her how to get on easily.&nbsp; The `haughty, uninteresting

<P>creature' was let severely alone, but Amy's talent and taste were duly

<P>complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself

<P>to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair

<P>opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which

<P>it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty

<P>women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices,

<P>try to work together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter

<P>was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time

<P>several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.

<P>Amy's dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted

<P>vases--that was one thorn.&nbsp; Then the all conquering Tudor had

<P>danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with

<P>May--that was thorn number two.&nbsp; But the chief grievance that

<P>rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct,

<P>was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to

<P>her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'.

<P>All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her

<P>naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection,

<P>and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.&nbsp; No

<P>hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay

<P>can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she

<P>was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester,

<P>who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,

<P>said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young

<P>ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls.&nbsp; As

<P>this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive

<P>table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it

<P>is thought best for them to take this place.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but I

<P>know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a

<P>little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table

<P>if you like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to

<P>deliver this little speech, but when the time came, she found

<P>it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious

<P>eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Amy felt that there was something behind this, but would

<P>not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that

<P>she did, "Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg.&nbsp; It's

<P>merely a matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally

<P>take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place.

<P>I think it very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for

<P>your efforts to make it so pretty, but we must give up our private

<P>wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place

<P>elsewhere.&nbsp; Wouldn't you like the flower table?&nbsp; The little
girls

<P>undertook it, but they are discouraged.&nbsp; You could make a charming

<P>thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Especially to gentlemen," added May, with a look which enlightened

<P>Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.&nbsp; She colored

<P>angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm,

<P>and answered with unexpected amiability...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.&nbsp; I'll give up my

<P>place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can put your own things on your own table, if you

<P>prefer," began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she

<P>looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint

<P>illuminations Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged.

<P>She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly .&nbsp;
..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way," and sweeping her

<P>contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling

<P>that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now she's mad.&nbsp; Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,&nbsp;
Mama,"

<P>said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Girls' quarrels are soon over," returned her mother, feeling

<P>a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight,

<P>which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and

<P>she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not

<P>artistically.&nbsp; But everything seemed against her.&nbsp; It was
late, and

<P>she was tired.&nbsp; Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to
help

<P>her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed

<P>and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion

<P>in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order.&nbsp; The

<P>evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled

<P>and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets

<P>were filled.&nbsp; Her best tile got a splash of water, which left a
sephia

<P>tear on the Cupid's cheek.&nbsp; She bruised her hands with hammering,
and

<P>got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with

<P>apprehensions for the morrow.&nbsp; Any girl reader who has suffered
like

<P>afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through

<P>her task.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was great indignation at home when she told her story

<P>that evening.&nbsp; Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she

<P>had done right.&nbsp; Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all,

<P>and Jo demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave

<P>those mean people to get on without her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because they are mean is no reason why i should be.&nbsp; I hate

<P>such things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't

<P>intend to show it.&nbsp; They will feel that more than angry speeches

<P>or huffy actions, won't they, Marmee?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's the right spirit, my dear.&nbsp; A kiss for a blow is always

<P>best, though it's not very easy to give it sometimes," said her

<P>mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between

<P>preaching and practicing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and

<P>retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent

<P>on conquering her enemy by kindness.&nbsp; She began well, thanks to
a

<P>silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely.

<P>As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were

<P>in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production,

<P>a little book, the antique cover of which her father had found among

<P>his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully

<P>illuminated different texts.&nbsp; As she turned the pages rich in dainty

<P>devices with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that

<P>made her stop and think.&nbsp; Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet,

<P>blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another

<P>up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, "Thou shalt

<P>love thy neighbor as thyself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as her eye went from the

<P>bright page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that

<P>could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.&nbsp;
Amy

<P>stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some

<P>sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit.

<P>Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious

<P>ministers in street, school, office, or home.&nbsp; Even a fair table

<P>may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words

<P>which are never out of season.&nbsp; Amy's conscience preached her a

<P>little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many

<P>of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway

<P>put it in practice.

<P>A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring

<P>the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.&nbsp;
They

<P>dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing

<P>one side of the story and judging accordingly.&nbsp; It was not pleasant,

<P>but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance

<P>offered for proving it.&nbsp; She heard May say sorrowfully...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and

<P>I don't want to fill up with odds and ends.&nbsp; The table was just

<P>complete then.&nbsp; Now it's spoiled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her," suggested

<P>someone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How could I after all the fuss?" began May, but she did not

<P>finish, for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want

<P>them.&nbsp; I was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they

<P>belong to your table rather than mine.&nbsp; Here they are, please take

<P>them, and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a

<P>smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a

<P>friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?" cried one girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose

<P>temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added,

<P>with a disagreeable laugh, "Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't

<P>sell them at her own table."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, that was hard.&nbsp; When we make little sacrifices we like

<P>to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry

<P>she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its won reward.

<P>But it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to

<P>rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls

<P>were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the

<P>atmosphere amazingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind

<P>her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted

<P>very soon.&nbsp; Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets

<P>began to droop long before night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The art table was the most attractive in the room.&nbsp; There was

<P>a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying

<P>to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.&nbsp; Amy

<P>often looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt

<P>at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.&nbsp;
It

<P>might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young

<P>girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of

<P>Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale

<P>and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she

<P>made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.&nbsp; Her

<P>mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea.&nbsp; Beth helped her dress,

<P>and made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished

<P>her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting

<P>darkly that the tables were about to be turned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't do anything rude, pray Jo.&nbsp; I won't have any fuss made,

<P>so let it all pass and behave yourself," begged Amy, as she departed

<P>early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor

<P>little table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to ever

<P>one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible.

<P>Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet."

<P>returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.&nbsp; Presently

<P>the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is that my boy?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As sure as this is my girl!"&nbsp; And Laurie tucked her hand under

<P>his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, teddy, such doings!" And Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and

<P>I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and

<P>camp down before her table afterward," said Laurie, espousing her

<P>cause with warmth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones

<P>may not arrive in time.&nbsp; I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious,
but

<P>I shouldn't wonder if they never came at all.&nbsp; When people do one

<P>mean thing they are very likely to do another," observed Jo in a

<P>disgusted tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was

<P>poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking?

<P>They are just as much yours as mine.&nbsp; Don't we always go halves

<P>in everything?" began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo

<P>turn thorny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gracious, I hope not!&nbsp; Half of some of your things wouldn't

<P>suit me at all.&nbsp; But we mustn't stand philandering here.&nbsp;
I've got

<P>to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll

<P>be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the

<P>Hall, I'll bless you forever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Couldn't you do it now?" asked Laurie, so suggestively that

<P>Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called

<P>through the bars, "Go away, Teddy, I'm busy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night,

<P>for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket

<P>arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece.&nbsp; Then the March
family

<P>turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for

<P>people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring

<P>Amy's taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much.&nbsp; Laurie

<P>and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought

<P>up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner

<P>the liveliest spot in the room.&nbsp; Amy was in her element now, and
out

<P>of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible,

<P>coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was

<P>it's own reward, after all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was

<P>happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the

<P>hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon

<P>the subject of the Chester change of base.&nbsp; She reproached herself

<P>for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as

<P>soon as possible.&nbsp; She also discovered what Amy had done about
the

<P>things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity.&nbsp;
As

<P>she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister's

<P>things, but saw no sign of them.&nbsp; "Tucked away out of sight, I
dare

<P>say," thought Jo, who could forgiver her own wrongs, but hotly resented

<P>any insult offered her family.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good evening, Miss Jo.&nbsp; How does Amy get on?" asked May with

<P>a conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be

<P>generous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and

<P>now she is enjoying herself.&nbsp; The flower table is always attractive,

<P>you know, `especially to gentlemen'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap, but May took it

<P>so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising

<P>the great vases, which still remained unsold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about" I took a fancy to

<P>buy that for Father," said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of

<P>her sister's work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Everything of Amy's sold long ago.&nbsp; I took care that the

<P>right people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money

<P>for us," returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations,

<P>as well as Amy had, that day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and

<P>Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May's

<P>word and manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the

<P>other tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the

<P>art table," she said, ordering out `Teddy's own', as the girls

<P>called the college friends.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but

<P>do your duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art

<P>in every sense of the word," said the irrepressible Jo, as the

<P>devoted phalanx prepared to take the field.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May," said

<P>little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender,

<P>and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, my son, for a small boy!" and walked him off, with

<P>a paternal pat on the head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Buy the vases," whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping

<P>of coals of fire on her enemy's head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases,

<P>but pervaded the hall with one under each arm.&nbsp; The other gentlemen

<P>speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and

<P>wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers,

<P>painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate

<P>purchases.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and

<P>said something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter

<P>lady beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of

<P>mingled pride and anxiety, though she did not betray the cause

<P>of her pleasure till several days later.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy

<P>goodnight, she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate

<P>kiss, and a look which said `forgive and forget'.&nbsp; That satisfied

<P>Amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on

<P>the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each.&nbsp; "The

<P>reward of merit for a magnanimous March," as Laurie announced

<P>with a flourish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness

<P>of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy.&nbsp; You've behaved

<P>sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart," said Jo

<P>warmly, as they brushed their hair together late that night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.

<P>It must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting

<P>your heart on selling your own pretty things.&nbsp; I don't believe
I could

<P>have done it as kindly as you did," added Beth from her pillow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so.&nbsp; I only did as I'd

<P>be done by.&nbsp; You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but

<P>I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do

<P>it as far as I know how.&nbsp; I can't explain exactly, but I want to

<P>be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil

<P>so many women.&nbsp; I'm far from it now, but I do my best, and hope
in

<P>time to be what Mother is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, "I

<P>understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again.

<P>You are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons

<P>of you in true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe.

<P>Try away, deary, you'll get your reward some day, and

<P>no one will be more delighted than I shall."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it

<P>hard to be delighted.&nbsp; A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs.

<P>March's face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it

<P>that Jo and Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad

<P>tiding were.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me to go with her!" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair

<P>in an uncontrollable rapture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, dear, not you.&nbsp; It's Amy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Mother!&nbsp; She's too young, it's my turn first.&nbsp; I've

<P>wanted it so long.&nbsp; It would do me so much good, and be so altogether

<P>splendid.&nbsp; I must go!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo.&nbsp; Aunt says Amy, decidedly,

<P>and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's always so.&nbsp; Amy has all the fun and I have all the work.

<P>It isn't fair, oh, it isn't fair!" cried Jo passionately.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear.&nbsp; When Aunt spoke

<P>to me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too

<P>independent spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you

<P>had said--`I planned at first to ask Jo, but as `favors burden her',

<P>and she `hates French', I think I won't venture to invite her.&nbsp;
Amy

<P>is more docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and receive

<P>gratefully any help the trip may give her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!&nbsp; Why can't I learn to

<P>keep it quiet?' groaned Jo, remembering words which had been

<P>her undoing.&nbsp; When she had heard the explanation of the quoted

<P>phrases, Mrs. March said sorrowfully...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this

<P>time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure

<P>by reproaches or regrets."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try," said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick

<P>up the basket she had joyfully upset.&nbsp; "I'll take a leaf out of

<P>her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not

<P>grudge her one minute of happiness.&nbsp; But it won't be easy, for

<P>it is a dreadful disappointment."&nbsp; And poor Jo bedewed the little

<P>fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.

<P>"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and

<P>I'm glad you are not going quite yet," whispered Beth, embracing

<P>her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face

<P>that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her

<P>want to box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden

<P>her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in

<P>the family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps,

<P>but without repinings at Amy's good fortune.&nbsp; The young lady

<P>herself received the news as tidings of great joy, went about

<P>in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and

<P>pack her pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes,

<P>money, and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art

<P>than herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls," she said impressively,

<P>as she scraped her best palette.&nbsp; "It will decide my career,

<P>for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome,

<P>and will do something to prove it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suppose you haven't?" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes,

<P>at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,"

<P>replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure.

<P>But she made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away

<P>at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she

<P>gave up her hopes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, you won't.&nbsp; You hate hard work, and you'll marry some

<P>rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your

<P>days," said Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe

<P>that one will.&nbsp; I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be

<P>an artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,"

<P>said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit

<P>her better than that of a poor drawing teacher.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hum!" said Jo, with a sigh.&nbsp; "If you wish it you'll have it,

<P>for your wishes are always granted--mine never."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Would you like to go?" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her

<P>nose with her knife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Rather!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in

<P>the Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so

<P>many times."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful

<P>day comes, if it ever does," returned Jo, accepting the vague but

<P>magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.

<P>"There was not much time for preparation, and the house was

<P>in a ferment till Amy was off.&nbsp; Jo bore up very well till the

<P>last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her

<P>refuge, the garret, and cried till she couldn't cry any more.

<P>Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed.&nbsp; Then

<P>just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came

<P>over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and

<P>those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last

<P>lingerer, saying with a sob...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should

<P>happen...&nbsp; "
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come

<P>and comfort you," whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would

<P>be called upon to keep his word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always

<P>new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend

<P>watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle

<P>fortunes would befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand

<P>to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling

<P>on the sea.
