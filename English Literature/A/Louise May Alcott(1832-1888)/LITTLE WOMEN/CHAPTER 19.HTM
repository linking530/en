<P>While these things were happening at home, Amy was having

<P>hard times at Aunt March's.&nbsp; She felt her exile deeply, and

<P>for the first time in her life, realized how much she was

<P>beloved and petted at home.&nbsp; Aunt March never petted any one.

<P>She did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-

<P>behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had

<P>a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children, though

<P>she didn't think it proper to confess it.&nbsp; She really did her

<P>best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made.

<P>Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and

<P>gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and

<P>joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under

<P>pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest

<P>way.&nbsp; But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very

<P>much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy

<P>talks.&nbsp; Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister,

<P>the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as

<P>possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.&nbsp; So she

<P>took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been

<P>taught sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's

<P>soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict

<P>spider.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the

<P>old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till

<P>they shone.&nbsp; Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job

<P>that was.&nbsp; Not a speck escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the

<P>furniture had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted

<P>to suit.&nbsp; Then Polly had to be fed, the lap dog combed, and a

<P>dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders,

<P>for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair.&nbsp;
After

<P>these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily

<P>trial of every virtue she possessed.&nbsp; Then she was allowed one

<P>hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was

<P>allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had

<P>capital times.&nbsp; After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still

<P>while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as

<P>she dropped off over the first page.&nbsp; Then patchwork or towels

<P>appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion

<P>till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked

<P>till teatime.&nbsp; The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March

<P>fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so

<P>unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to be, intending

<P>to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before

<P>she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid,

<P>she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful

<P>time.&nbsp; The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for

<P>he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself

<P>by being as mischievous as possible.&nbsp; He pulled her hair

<P>whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her

<P>when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking

<P>at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and

<P>behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.&nbsp; Then she

<P>could not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and

<P>yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back

<P>with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of

<P>countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a

<P>dozen times a day.&nbsp; The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman

<P>was deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of

<P>the young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with`Madame', as

<P>she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather

<P>tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her.

<P>Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it,

<P>and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change

<P>her religion.&nbsp; She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her

<P>very much with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat

<P>with her while she got up Madam's laces.&nbsp; She also allowed her

<P>to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty

<P>things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests,

<P>for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.&nbsp; Amy's chief delight was

<P>an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes,

<P>and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments,

<P>some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique.

<P>To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction,

<P>especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed

<P>the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago.&nbsp; There

<P>was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the

<P>pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover's diamonds,

<P>the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits

<P>of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby

<P>bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March's big

<P>watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with,

<P>and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring, too small

<P>now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most

<P>precious jewel of them all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?" asked

<P>Esther, wo always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them,

<P>and I'm fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.&nbsp; I should choose

<P>this if I might," replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a

<P>string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of

<P>the same.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.&nbsp; Ah, no!&nbsp; To me
it

<P>is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic," said

<P>Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling

<P>wooden beads hanging over your glass?" asked Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Truly, yes, to pray with.&nbsp; It would be pleasing to the saints

<P>if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a

<P>vain bijou."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers,

<P>Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied.&nbsp; I wish

<P>I could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort,

<P>but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each

<P>day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served

<P>before Madame.&nbsp; She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement

<P>for much trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Would it be right for me to do so too?" asked Amy, who in

<P>her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that

<P>she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there

<P>to remind her of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly

<P>arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it.&nbsp; Say

<P>nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a

<P>while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve

<P>your sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for

<P>she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in

<P>their anxiety.&nbsp; Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange

<P>the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when

<P>Aunt March dies," she said, as she slowly replaced the shining

<P>rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To you and your sisters.&nbsp; I know it, Madame confides in me.

<P>I witnessed her will, and it is to be so," whispered Esther smiling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How nice!&nbsp; But I wish she'd let us have them now.

<P>Procrastination is not agreeable," observed Amy, taking a last

<P>look at the diamonds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things.

<P>The first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said

<P>it, and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given

<P>to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and

<P>charming manners."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think so?&nbsp; Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that

<P>lovely ring!&nbsp; It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.&nbsp;
I do

<P>like Aunt March after all." And Amy tried on the blue ring with a

<P>delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady

<P>complacently admired the success of her training.&nbsp; Esther fitted

<P>up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it,

<P>and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.&nbsp; She

<P>thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she

<P>borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor

<P>care if she did.&nbsp; It was, however, a very valuable copy of one
of

<P>the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's beauty-loving eyes were

<P>never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother,

<P>while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart.&nbsp; On

<P>the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook, kept a vase

<P>always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every

<P>day to `sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear

<P>God to preserve her sister.&nbsp; Esther had given her a rosary of black

<P>beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it,

<P>feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left

<P>alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind

<P>hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the

<P>strong and tender Friend, whose fatherly love most closely

<P>surrounds His little children.&nbsp; She missed her mother's help to

<P>understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look,

<P>she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly.&nbsp; But

<P>Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy.

<P>She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with

<P>doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.&nbsp; In her first

<P>effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will, as

<P>Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her

<P>possessions might be justly and generously divided.&nbsp; It cost her
a pang

<P>even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes

<P>were as precious as the old lady's jewels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During one of her play hours she wrote out the important

<P>document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as

<P>to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman

<P>had signed her name, Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show

<P>Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness.&nbsp; As it was a rainy

<P>day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large

<P>chambers, and took Polly with her for company.&nbsp; In this room

<P>there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which

<P>Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to

<P>array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before

<P>the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train

<P>about with a rustle which delighted her ears.&nbsp; So busy was she
on

<P>this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face

<P>peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting

<P>her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban,

<P>contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted

<P>petticoat.&nbsp; She was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on

<P>highheeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical

<P>sight to see her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidilng

<P>and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as he could,

<P>and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, "Ain't we fine?

<P>Get along, you fright!&nbsp; Hold your tongue!&nbsp; Kiss me, dear!&nbsp;
Ha! Ha!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment,

<P>lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously

<P>received.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want

<P>to consult you about a very serious matter," said Amy, when she

<P>had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner.&nbsp; "That bird

<P>is the trial of my life," she continued, removing the pink mountain

<P>from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.

<P>"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as
a

<P>mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went

<P>to let him out, and found a big spider there.&nbsp; I poked it out,
and

<P>it ran under the bookcase.&nbsp; Polly marched straight after it, stooped

<P>down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a

<P>cock of his eye, `Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I couldn't help

<P>laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?" asked Laurie, yawning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and

<P>scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, `Catch her! Catch her!

<P>Catch her!' as I chased the spider."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's a lie!&nbsp; Oh, lor!" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's
toes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment," cried

<P>Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side

<P>and gravely croaked, "Allyluyer!&nbsp; Bless your buttons, dear!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I'm ready," said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a

<P>piece of paper out of her pocket.&nbsp; "I want you to read that, please,

<P>and tell me if it is legal and right.&nbsp; I felt I ought to do it,
for

<P>life is uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive

<P>speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity,

<P>considering the spelling:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and

<P>bequeethe all my earthly property--viz.to wit:--namely
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works

<P>of art, including frames.&nbsp; Also my $100, to do what he likes with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with

<P>pockets--also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I

<P>get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my; piece

<P>of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of

<P>her 'little girl'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax,

<P>also my bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most precious

<P>plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the

<P>little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if

<P>she can wear them being thin when she gets well.&nbsp; And I herewith

<P>also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my

<P>paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did

<P>say it hadn't any neck.&nbsp; Also in return for his great kindness

<P>in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes,

<P>Noter Dame is the best.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple

<P>box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for

<P>his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him

<P>for his favors to her family, especially Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue

<P>silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork

<P>I leave hoping she `will remember me, when it you see'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope

<P>all will be satisfied and not blame the dead.&nbsp; I forgive everyone,

<P>and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound.&nbsp; Amen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this

<P>20th day of Nov.&nbsp; Anni Domino 1861.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy Curtis March
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Witnesses:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Estelle Valnor,

<P>Theodore Laurence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained

<P>that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What put it into your head?&nbsp; Did anyone tell you about Beth's

<P>giving away her things?" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit

<P>of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She explained and then asked anxiously, "What about Beth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you.&nbsp; She felt so

<P>ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg,

<P>her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for

<P>her sake.&nbsp; She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks

<P>of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa.&nbsp; She never

<P>thought of a will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look

<P>up till a great tear dropped on the paper.&nbsp; Amy's face was full

<P>of trouble, but she only said, "Don't people put sort of

<P>postscripts to their wills, sometimes?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, `codicils', they call them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and

<P>given round to my friends.&nbsp; I forgot it, but I want it done though

<P>it will spoil my looks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice.

<P>Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her

<P>trials.&nbsp; But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with

<P>trembling lips, "Is there really any danger about Beth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't

<P>cry, dear."&nbsp; And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly

<P>gesture which was very comforting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting

<P>in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an

<P>aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not

<P>console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.
