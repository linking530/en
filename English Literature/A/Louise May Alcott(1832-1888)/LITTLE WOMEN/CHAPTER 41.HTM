<P>Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did

<P>not own it till long afterward.&nbsp; Men seldom do, for when women

<P>are the advisers, the lords of creation don't take the advice

<P>till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they

<P>intended to do.&nbsp; Then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds,

<P>they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it.&nbsp; If it

<P>fails, they generously give her the whole.&nbsp; Laurie went back

<P>to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several

<P>weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had

<P>improved him wonderfully, and he had better try it again.

<P>There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better,

<P>but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding

<P>he had received.&nbsp; Pride forbid, and whenever the longing

<P>grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating

<P>the words that had made the deepest impression, "I despise you."

<P>"Go and do something splendid that will make her love you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon

<P>brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy,

<P>but then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged

<P>in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down.&nbsp; He felt

<P>that his blighted affections were quite dead now, and though

<P>he should never cease to be a faithful mourner, there was

<P>no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.&nbsp; Jo wouldn't

<P>love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by doing

<P>something which should prove that a girl's no had not spoiled

<P>his life.&nbsp; He had always meant to do something, and Amy's

<P>advice was quite unnecessary.&nbsp; He had only been waiting till

<P>the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred.

<P>That being done, he felt that he was ready to `hide his

<P>stricken heart, and still toil on'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song,

<P>so Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to

<P>compose a Requiem which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the

<P>heart of every hearer.&nbsp; Therefore the next time the old gentleman

<P>found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off,

<P>he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends, and fell to

<P>work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.&nbsp; But

<P>whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or

<P>music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered

<P>that the Requiem was beyond him just at present.&nbsp; It was evident

<P>that his mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas

<P>needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a plaintive strain,

<P>he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled

<P>the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the stout Frenchman,

<P>and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in

<P>the beginning, but here again unforeseen difficulties beset

<P>him.&nbsp; He wanted Jo for his heroine, and called upon his memory

<P>to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions

<P>of his love.&nbsp; But memory turned traitor, and as if possessed

<P>by the perverse spirit of the girl, would only recall Jo's

<P>oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in the most

<P>unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her head tied up in

<P>a bandana, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing

<P>cold water over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable

<P>laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to

<P>paint.&nbsp; Jo wouldn't be put into the opera at any price, and he

<P>had to give her up with a "Bless that girl, what a torment she is!"

<P>and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he looked about him for another and a less intractable

<P>damsel to immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the

<P>most obliging readiness.&nbsp; This phantom wore many faces, but it

<P>always had golden hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and

<P>floated airily before his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses,

<P>peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons.&nbsp; He did not give the

<P>complacent wraith any name, but he took her for his heroine and

<P>grew quite fond of her, as well he might, for he gifted her with

<P>every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted her, unscathed,

<P>through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time,

<P>but gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose,

<P>while he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city

<P>to get some new ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be

<P>in a somewhat unsettled state that winter.&nbsp; He did not do much,

<P>but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of

<P>some sort going on in spite of himself.&nbsp; "It's genius simmering,

<P>perhaps.&nbsp; I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of it," he said,

<P>with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasn't genius, but

<P>something far more common.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it simmered to

<P>some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his

<P>desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work

<P>to go at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion

<P>that everyone who loved music was not a composer.&nbsp; Returning

<P>from one of Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at

<P>the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own, played a few of the

<P>best parts, sat staring at the busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven,

<P>and bach, who stared benignly back again.&nbsp; Then suddenly he

<P>tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered

<P>out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is right!&nbsp; Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it

<P>so.&nbsp; That music has taken the vanity out of my as Rome took it

<P>out of her, and I won't be a humbug any longer.&nbsp; Now what shall

<P>I do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to

<P>wish he had to work for his daily bread.&nbsp; Now if ever, occurred

<P>an eligible opportunity for `going to the devil', as he once

<P>forcibly expressed it, for he had plenty of money and nothing

<P>to do, and Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment

<P>for full and idle hands.&nbsp; The poor fellow had temptations

<P>enough from without and from within, but he withstood them

<P>pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good

<P>faith and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather,

<P>and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of

<P>the women who loved him, and say "All's well," kept him safe

<P>and steady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, "I don't believe it,

<P>boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats,

<P>and women must not expect miracles."&nbsp; I dare say you don't,

<P>Mrs. Grundy, but it's true nevertheless.&nbsp; Women work

<P>a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion that they may

<P>perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by

<P>refusing to echo such sayings.&nbsp; Let the boys be boys, the

<P>longer the better, and let the young men sow their wild oats

<P>if they must.&nbsp; But mothers, sisters, and friends may help to

<P>make the crop a small one, and keep many tares from spoiling

<P>the harvest, by believing, and showing that they believe, in

<P>the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest

<P>in good women's eyes.&nbsp; If it is a feminine delusion,&nbsp; leave
us

<P>to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and

<P>the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would

<P>embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads,

<P>who still love their mothers better than themselves and are

<P>not ashamed to own it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo

<P>would absorb all his powers for years, but to his great surprise

<P>he discovered it grew easier every day.&nbsp; He refused to believe

<P>it at first, got angry with himself, and couldn't understand it,

<P>but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and

<P>time and nature work their will in spite of us.&nbsp; Laurie's heart

<P>wouldn't ache.&nbsp; The wound persisted in healing with a rapidity

<P>that astonished him, and instead of trying to forget, he found

<P>himself trying to remember.&nbsp; He had not foreseen this turn of

<P>affairs, and was not prepared for it.&nbsp; He was disgusted with

<P>himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a

<P>queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could

<P>recover from such a tremendous blow so soon.&nbsp; He carefully

<P>stirred up the embers of his lost love, but they refused to

<P>burst into a blaze.&nbsp; There was only a comfortable glow that

<P>warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever,

<P>and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish

<P>passion was slowly subbsiding into a more tranquil sentiment,

<P>very tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was

<P>sure to pass away in time, leaving a brotherly affection

<P>which would last unbroken to the end.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the word `brotherly' passed through his mind in one

<P>of his reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of

<P>Mozart that was before him...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have

<P>one sister he took the other, and was happy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and

<P>the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,

<P>"No, I won't!&nbsp; I haven't forgotten, I never can.&nbsp; I'll try
again,

<P>and if that fails, why then...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper

<P>and wrote to Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything

<P>while there was the least hope of her changing her mind.

<P>Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let him come home and be happy?

<P>While waiting for an answer he did nothing, but he did it

<P>energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience.&nbsp; It came

<P>at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo

<P>decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.&nbsp; She was wrapped up in Beth,

<P>and never wished to hear the word love again.&nbsp; Then she begged

<P>him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little

<P>corner of his ghart for his loving sister Jo.&nbsp; In a postscript

<P>she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was

<P>coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening

<P>the remainder of her stay.&nbsp; That would be time enough, please

<P>God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel

<P>lonely, homesick or anxious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I will, at once.&nbsp; Poor little girl, it will be a sad

<P>going home for her, I'm afraid."&nbsp; And Laurie opened his desk,

<P>as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the

<P>sentence left unfinished some weeks before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged

<P>out his best paper, he came across something which

<P>changed his purpose.&nbsp; Tumbling about in one part of the desk

<P>among bills, passports, and business documents of various kinds

<P>were several of Jo's letters, and in another compartment were

<P>three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue

<P>ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put

<P>away inside.&nbsp; with a half-repentant, half-amused expression,

<P>Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put

<P>them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute

<P>turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew

<P>it off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went

<P>out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if there

<P>had been a funeral, and though not overwhelmed with affliction,

<P>this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than

<P>in writing letters to charming young ladies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered,

<P>for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the most

<P>delightfully confiding manner.&nbsp; The correspondence flourished

<P>famously, and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity

<P>all through the early spring.&nbsp; Laurie sold his busts, made

<P>allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris, hoping somebody

<P>would arrive before long.&nbsp; He wanted desperately to go

<P>to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not

<P>ask him, for just then she was having little experiences of

<P>her own, which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical

<P>eyes of `out boy'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which

<P>she had once decided to answer, "Yes, thank you," but now she

<P>said, "No, thank you," kindly but steadily, for when the time

<P>came, her courage failed her, and she found that something

<P>more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new

<P>longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and

<P>fears.&nbsp; The words, "Fred is a good fellow, but not at all

<P>the man I fancied you would ever like," and Laurie's face

<P>when he uttered them, kept returning to her as pertinaciously

<P>as her own did when she said in look, if not in words, "I

<P>shall marry for money."&nbsp; It troubled her to remember that

<P>now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so unwomanly.

<P>She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless,&nbsp; worldly

<P>creature.&nbsp; She didn't care to be a queen of society now

<P>half so much as she did to be a lovable woman.&nbsp; She was

<P>so glad he didn't hate her for the dreadful things she said,

<P>but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever.&nbsp; His

<P>letters were such a comfort, for the home letters were very

<P>irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did

<P>come.&nbsp; It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,

<P>for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo

<P>persisted in being stonyhearted.&nbsp; She ought to have made an

<P>effort and tried to love him.&nbsp; It couldn't be very hard,

<P>many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy

<P>care for them.&nbsp; But Jo never would act like other girls, so

<P>there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like

<P>a brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at

<P>this period, they would be a much happier race of beings than

<P>they are.&nbsp; Amy never lectured now.&nbsp; She asked his opinion
on

<P>all subjects, she was interested in everything he did, made

<P>charming little presents for him, and sent him two letters

<P>a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and

<P>captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.&nbsp; As few

<P>brothers are complimented by having their letters carried

<P>about in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently,

<P>cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully,

<P>we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and

<P>foolish things.&nbsp; But she certainly did grow a little pale

<P>and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society,

<P>and went out sketching alone a good deal.&nbsp; She never had much

<P>to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare

<P>say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the

<P>terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that

<P>occurred to her, a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a young

<P>man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly

<P>haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ballroom on

<P>the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur

<P>according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not

<P>altogether satisfactory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred,

<P>and finding denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy

<P>left her to think what she liked, taking care that Laurie

<P>should know that Fred had gone to Egypt.&nbsp; That was all, but

<P>he understood it, and looked relieved, as he said to himself,

<P>with a venerable air .&nbsp; ..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was sure she would think better of it.&nbsp; Poor old fellow!

<P>I've been through it all, and I can sympathize."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had

<P>discharged his duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa

<P>and enjoyed Amy's letter luxuriously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had

<P>come at home.&nbsp; But the letter telling that Beth was failing

<P>never reached Amy, and when the next found her at Vevay, for

<P>the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they had travelled

<P>slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian

<P>lakes.&nbsp; She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the

<P>family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for

<P>since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better

<P>stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.&nbsp; But her heart was

<P>very heavy, she longed to be at home, and every day looked

<P>wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and

<P>comfort her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters

<P>to them both, but he was in Germany, and it took some days to

<P>reach him.&nbsp; The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack,

<P>bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his

<P>promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the

<P>little quay, he hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the

<P>Carrols were living en pension.&nbsp; The garcon was in despair

<P>that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the

<P>lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau

<P>garden.&nbsp; If monsier would give himself the pain of sitting

<P>down, a flash of time should present her.&nbsp; But monsieur could

<P>not wait even a `flash of time', and in the middle of the

<P>speech departed to find mademoiselle himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake,

<P>with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and

<P>the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny

<P>water.&nbsp; At one corner of the wide, low wall was a seat, and here

<P>Amy often came to read or work, or console herself with the

<P>beauty all about her.&nbsp; She was sitting here that day, leaning

<P>her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,

<P>thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.&nbsp; She

<P>did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause

<P>in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the

<P>garden.&nbsp; He stood a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing

<P>what no one had ever seen before, the tender side of Amy's character.

<P>Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow,

<P>the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up

<P>her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the

<P>little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie,

<P>for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament.

<P>If he had any doubts about the reception she would give

<P>him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw

<P>him, for dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a

<P>tone of unmistakable love and longing...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I think everything was said and settled then, for as they

<P>stood together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head

<P>bent down protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no

<P>one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie, and

<P>Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who

<P>could fill Jo's place and make him happy.&nbsp; He did not tell her

<P>so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,

<P>were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she

<P>dried her tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered papers,

<P>finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive

<P>sketches good omens for the future.&nbsp; As he sat down beside her,

<P>amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of

<P>her impulsive greeting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so

<P>very glad to see you.&nbsp; It was such a surprise to look up and find

<P>you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn't come," she said,

<P>trying in vain to speak quite naturally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I came the minute I heard.&nbsp; I wish I could say something

<P>to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only

<P>feel, and..."&nbsp; He could not get any further, for her too

<P>turned bashful all of a sudden, and did not quite know what to

<P>say.&nbsp; He longed to lay Amy's head down on his shoulder, and tell

<P>her to have a good cry, but he did not dare, so took her hand

<P>instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than

<P>words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You needn't say anything, this comforts me," she said

<P>softly.&nbsp; "Beth is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back,

<P>but I dread the going home, much as I long to see them all.

<P>We won't talk about it now, for it makes me cry, and I want

<P>to enjoy you while you stay.&nbsp; You needn't go right back, need

<P>you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not if you want me, dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do, so much.&nbsp; Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you

<P>seem like one of the family, and it would be so comfortable to

<P>have you for a little while."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart

<P>was full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and

<P>gave her just what she wanted--the petting she was used to and

<P>the cheerful conversation she needed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself

<P>half sick!&nbsp; I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any

<P>more, but come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly

<P>for you to sit still," he said, in the half-caressing,

<P>half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on her hat,

<P>drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the

<P>sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.&nbsp; He felt more at

<P>ease upon his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong

<P>arm to lean upon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind

<P>voice to talk delightfully for her alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers,

<P>and seemed expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was

<P>it, with nothing but the tower to overlook them, and the wide

<P>lake to carry away the echo of their words, as it rippled by

<P>below.&nbsp; For an hour this new pair walked and talked, or rested

<P>on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a

<P>charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell

<P>warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of

<P>lonliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she

<P>was illuminated with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself,

<P>"Now I understand it all--the child has been pining for young

<P>Laurence.&nbsp; Bless my heart, I never thought of such a thing!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing,

<P>and betrayed no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged

<P>Laurie to stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it

<P>would do her more good than so much solitude.&nbsp; Amy was a

<P>model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal occupied

<P>with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it

<P>with more than her usual success.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.&nbsp; At

<P>Vevay, Laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding,

<P>boating, or studying in the most energetic manner, while

<P>Amy admired everything he did and followed his example as

<P>far and as fast as she could.&nbsp; He said the change was owing

<P>to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad

<P>of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise

<P>worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies.

<P>They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there

<P>among the everlasting hills.&nbsp; The fresh winds blew away

<P>desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists.&nbsp; The

<P>warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas,

<P>tender hopes, and happy thoughts.&nbsp; The lake seemed to wash

<P>away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains

<P>to look benignly down upon them saying, "Little children,

<P>love one another."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so

<P>happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.&nbsp; It

<P>took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the

<P>cure of his first, and as he had firmly believed, his last

<P>and only love.&nbsp; He consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty

<P>by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the same as Jo's

<P>self, and the conviction that it would have been impossible

<P>to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.&nbsp; His first

<P>wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back

<P>upon ;it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of

<P>compassion blended with regret.&nbsp; He was not ashamed of it,

<P>but put it away as one of the bitter-sweet experiences of his

<P>life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over.

<P>His second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and simple

<P>as possible.&nbsp; There was no need of having a scene, hardly

<P>any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it without

<P>words and had given him his answer long ago.&nbsp; It all came

<P>about so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that

<P>everybody would be pleased, even Jo.&nbsp; But when our first little

<P>passion has been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making

<P>a second trial, so Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour,

<P>and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would

<P>put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place

<P>in the chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and

<P>decorus manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the

<P>matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words.

<P>They had been floating about all the morning, from gloomy

<P>St. Gingolf to sunny Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side,

<P>Mont St. Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in

<P>the valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue

<P>sky overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque

<P>boats that look like white-winged gulls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past

<P>Chillon, and of Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he

<P>wrote his Heloise.&nbsp; Neither had read it, but they knew it was a

<P>love story, and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting

<P>as their own.&nbsp; Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water

<P>during the little pause that fell between them, and when she looked

<P>up, Laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes

<P>that made her say hastily, merely for the sake of saying something .&nbsp;
.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must be tired.&nbsp; Rest a little, and let me row.&nbsp; It will
do me good,

<P>for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.&nbsp; There's

<P>room enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the

<P>boat won't trim," returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the

<P>offered third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted

<P>an oar.&nbsp; She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though

<P>she used both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and

<P>the boat went smoothly through the water.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How well we pull together, don't we?" said Amy, who objected

<P>to silence just then.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat.

<P>Will you, Amy?" very tenderly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Laurie," very low.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a

<P>pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving

<P>views reflected in the lake.
