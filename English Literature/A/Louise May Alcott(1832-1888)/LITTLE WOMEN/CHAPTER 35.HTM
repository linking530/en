<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to

<P>some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and

<P>gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the

<P>eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends said.&nbsp; They were

<P>all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr. and Mrs. March,

<P>John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the

<P>sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but

<P>fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall

<P>be home early tomorrow.&nbsp; You'll come and meet me as usual,

<P>girls?" Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage

<P>after the joys of the day were over.&nbsp; He said `girls', but he

<P>meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up the old custom.

<P>She had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy

<P>anything, and answered warmly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you,

<P>playing `Hail the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a

<P>sudden panic, "Oh, deary me!&nbsp; I know he'll say something, and

<P>then what shall I do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her

<P>fears, and having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough

<P>to think people were going to propose when she had given them

<P>every reason to know what her answer would be, she set forth

<P>at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn't do anything to

<P>make her hurt his poor feelings.&nbsp; A call at Meg's, and a

<P>refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still

<P>further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw

<P>a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong

<P>desire to turn about and run away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as

<P>he was within speaking distance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I forgot it." And Jo took heart again, for that salutation

<P>could not be called loverlike.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now

<P>she did not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign,

<P>but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects,

<P>till they turned from the road into the little path that led

<P>homeward through the grove.&nbsp; Then he walked more slowly, suddenly

<P>lost his fine flow of language, and now and then a dreadful

<P>pause occurred.&nbsp; To rescue the conversation from one of

<P>the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said

<P>hastily, "Now you must have a good long holiday!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I intend to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to

<P>find him looking down at her with an expression that assured

<P>her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand

<P>with an imploring, "No, Teddy.&nbsp; Please don't!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will, and you must hear me.&nbsp; It's no use, Jo, we've got

<P>to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he

<P>answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say what you like then.&nbsp; I'll listen," said Jo, with a

<P>desperate sort of patience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant

<P>to `have it out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into

<P>the subject with characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice

<P>that would get choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to

<P>keep it steady .&nbsp; ..

<P>"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help

<P>it, you've been so good to me.&nbsp; I've tried to show it, but you

<P>wouldn't let me.&nbsp; Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an

<P>answer, for I can't go on so any longer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wanted to save you this.&nbsp; I thought you'd understand...

<P>began Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know

<P>what they mean.&nbsp; They say no when they mean yes, and drive a

<P>man out of his wits just for the fun of it," returned Laurie,

<P>entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't.&nbsp; I never wanted to make you care for me so, and

<P>I went away to keep you from it if I could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought so.&nbsp; It was like you, but it was no use.&nbsp; I

<P>only loved you all the more, and I worked hard to please you,

<P>and I gave up billiards and everything you didn't like, and

<P>waited and never complained, for I hoped you'd love me, though

<P>I'm not half good enough..." Here there was a choke that

<P>couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he

<P>cleared his `confounded throat'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and

<P>I'm so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't

<P>know why I can't love you as you want me to.&nbsp; I've tried, but

<P>I can't change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do

<P>when I don't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Really, truly, Jo?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put

<P>his question with a look that she did not soon forget.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Really, truly, dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when

<P>the last words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped

<P>her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life

<P>the fence was too much for him.&nbsp; So he just laid his head down

<P>on the mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill

<P>myself if it would do any good!&nbsp; I wish you wouldn't take it

<P>so hard, I can't help it.&nbsp; You know it's impossible for people

<P>to make themselves love other people if they don't," cried Jo

<P>inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder,

<P>remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They do sometimes," said a muffled voice from the post.

<P>"I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd

<P>rather not try it," was the decided answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on

<P>the willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind.

<P>Presently Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of

<P>the stile, "Laurie, I want to tell you something."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and

<P>cried out in a fierce tone, "Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear

<P>it now!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell what?" she asked, wondering at his violence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That you love that old man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What old man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his

<P>grandfather.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That devilish Professor you were always writing about.

<P>If you say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate."

<P>And he looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched

<P>his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly,

<P>for she too, was getting excited with all this, "Don't swear,

<P>Teddy!&nbsp; He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and

<P>the best friend I've got, next to you.&nbsp; Pray, don't fly into

<P>a passion.&nbsp; I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if

<P>you abuse my Professor.&nbsp; I haven't the least idea of loving

<P>him or anybody else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and

<P>forget all this trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo,

<P>Never! Never!" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall I do with him?" sighed Jo, finding that emotions

<P>were more unmanagable than she expected.&nbsp; "You haven't heard

<P>what I wanted to tell you.&nbsp; Sit down and listen, for indeed I

<P>want to do right and make you happy," she said, hoping to soothe

<P>him with a little reason, which proved that she knew nothing

<P>about love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself

<P>down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower

<P>step of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face.

<P>Now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear

<P>thought on Jo's part, for how could she say hard things to her

<P>boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing,

<P>and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness

<P>of heart had wrung from him?&nbsp; She gently turned his head away,

<P>saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to

<P>grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure!

<P>"I agree with Mother that you and I are not suited to each

<P>other, because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably

<P>make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as to..."

<P>Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered it

<P>with a rapturous expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Marry--no we shouldn't!&nbsp; If you loved me, Jo, I should

<P>be a perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I can't.&nbsp; I've tried and failed, and I won't risk

<P>our happiness by such a serious experiment.&nbsp; We don't agree and

<P>we never shall, so we'll be good friends all our lives, but we

<P>won't go and do anything rash."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, we will if we get the chance," muttered Laurie rebelliously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,"

<P>implored Jo, almost at her wit's end.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I won't be reasonable.&nbsp; I don't want to take what you

<P>call `a sensible view'.&nbsp; It won't help me, and it only makes

<P>it harder.&nbsp; I don't believe you've got any heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I hadn't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a

<P>good omen, Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive

<P>powers to bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had

<P>never been so dangerously wheedlesome before, "Don't disappoint

<P>us, dear!&nbsp; Everyone expects it.&nbsp; Grandpa has set his heart
upon

<P>it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you.&nbsp; Say

<P>you will, and let's be happy.&nbsp; Do, do!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had

<P>the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had

<P>made when she decided that she did not love her boy, and

<P>never could.&nbsp; It was very hard to do, but she did it, knowing

<P>that delay was both useless and cruel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't say `yes' truly, so I won't say it at all.&nbsp; You'll

<P>see that I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it..." she

<P>began solemnly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll be hanged if I do!"&nbsp; And Laurie bounced up off the

<P>grass, burning with indignation at the very idea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you will!" persisted Jo.&nbsp; "You'll get over this after

<P>a while, and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore

<P>you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house.&nbsp; I shouldn't.

<P>I'm homely and awkward and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed

<P>of me, and we should quarrel--we can't help it even now, you see-and

<P>I shouldn't like elegant society and you would, and you'd

<P>hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on without it, and we

<P>should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and everything

<P>would be horrid!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anything more?" asked asked Laurie, finding it hard to

<P>listen patiently to this prophetic burst.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever

<P>marry.&nbsp; I'm happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to

<P>be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know better!" broke in Laurie.&nbsp; "You think so now,

<P>but there'll come a time when you will care for somebody, and

<P>you'll love him tremendously, and live and die for him.&nbsp; I

<P>know you will, it's your way, and I shall have to stand by

<P>and see it."&nbsp; And the despairing lover cast his hat upon the

<P>ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical, if his

<P>face had not been so tragic.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I will live and die for him, if her ever comes and

<P>makes me love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best

<P>you can!" cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy.&nbsp; "I've

<P>done my best, but you won't be reasonable, and it's selfish

<P>of you to keep teasing for what I can't give.&nbsp; I shall always

<P>be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but I'll never

<P>marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for both

<P>of us--so now!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That speech was like gunpowder.&nbsp; Laurie looked at her a

<P>minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself,

<P>then turned sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone,

<P>"You'll be sorry some day, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, where are you going?" she cried, for his face frightened her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To the devil!" was the consoling answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself

<P>down the bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin

<P>or misery to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie

<P>was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single

<P>failure.&nbsp; He had no thought of a melodramatic plunge, but

<P>some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat,

<P>and row away with all his might, making better time up the

<P>river than he had done in any race.&nbsp; Jo drew a long breath and

<P>unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to

<P>outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a

<P>tender, penitent state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him."

<P>she said, adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she

<P>had murdered some innocent thing, and buried it under the

<P>leaves.&nbsp; "Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very

<P>kind to my poor boy.&nbsp; I wish he'd love Beth, perhaps he may

<P>in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.&nbsp; Oh

<P>dear!&nbsp; How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?&nbsp;
I

<P>think it's dreadful."

<P>Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she

<P>went straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely

<P>through, and then broke down, crying so dismally over her own

<P>insensibility that the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed,

<P>did not utter a reproach.&nbsp; He found it difficult to understand

<P>how any girl could help loving Laurie, and hoped she would

<P>change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo that love

<P>cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and resolved

<P>to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's

<P>parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his

<P>grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the

<P>delusion very successfully for an hour or two.&nbsp; But when they

<P>sat together in the twilight, the time they used to enjoy so

<P>much, it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual,

<P>and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of

<P>the last year's success, which to him now seemed like love's

<P>labor lost.&nbsp; He bore it as long as he could, then went to

<P>his piano and began to play.&nbsp; The window's were open, and Jo,

<P>walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood music

<P>better than her sister, for he played the `SONATA PATHETIQUE',

<P>and played it as he never did before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make

<P>one cry.&nbsp; Give us something gayer, lad," said Mr. Laurence,

<P>whose kind old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to

<P>show but knew not how.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for

<P>several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a

<P>momentary lull Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling,

<P>"Jo, dear, come in.&nbsp; I want you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning!

<P>As he listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken

<P>chord, and the musician sat silent in the dark.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't stand this," muttered the old gentleman.&nbsp; Up he

<P>got, groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either

<P>of the broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, "I

<P>know, my boy, I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, "Who

<P>told you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo herself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then there's an end of it!"&nbsp; And he shook off his grandfather's

<P>hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful

<P>for the sympathy, his man's pride could not bear a man's pity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite.&nbsp; I want to say one thing, and then there shall

<P>be an end of it," returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness.

<P>"You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't intend to run away from a girl.&nbsp; Jo can't prevent

<P>my seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,"

<P>interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not if you are the gentleman I think you.&nbsp; I'm disappointed,

<P>but the girl can't help it, and the only thing left

<P>for you to do is to go away for a time.&nbsp; Where will you go?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anywhere.&nbsp; I don't care what becomes of me."&nbsp; And Laurie

<P>got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's

<P>ear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's

<P>sake.&nbsp; Why not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should

<P>when you got through college."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!"&nbsp; And Laurie walked

<P>fast through the room with an expression which it was well

<P>his grandfather did not see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't ask you to go alone.&nbsp; There's someone ready and

<P>glad to go with you, anywhere in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who, Sir?' stopping to listen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his

<P>hand, saying huskily, "I'm a selfish brute, but--you know-Grandfather--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all

<P>before, once in my own young days, and then with your father.

<P>Now, my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan.&nbsp; It's

<P>all settled, and can be carried out at once," said Mr. Laurence,

<P>keeping hold of the young man, as if fearful that he would break

<P>away as his father had done before him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, sir, what is it?" And Laurie sat down, without a

<P>sign of interest in face or voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is business in London that needs looking after.&nbsp; I

<P>meant you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself,

<P>and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage

<P>them.&nbsp; My partners do almost everything, I'm merely holding

<P>on until you take my place, and can be off at any time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you hate traveling, Sir.&nbsp; I can't ask it of you at

<P>your age," began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice,

<P>but much preferred to go alone, if he went at all.

<P>The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly

<P>desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he found his

<P>grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to

<P>his own devices.&nbsp; So, stifling a natural regret at the thought

<P>of the home comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly,

<P>Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet.&nbsp; I quite enjoy the

<P>idea.&nbsp; It will do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for

<P>traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair

<P>was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the

<P>old man add hastily, "I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden.

<P>I go because I think you'd feel happier than if I was

<P>left behind.&nbsp; I don't intend to gad about with you, but leave

<P>you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my own

<P>way.&nbsp; I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to

<P>visit them.&nbsp; Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland,

<P>where you will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery,

<P>and adventures to your heart's content."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely

<P>broken and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound

<P>of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced

<P>into his closing sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected

<P>leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling

<P>wilderness.&nbsp; He sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone,

<P>"Just as you like, Sir.&nbsp; It doesn't matter where I go or what I
do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It does to me, remember that, my lad.&nbsp; I give you entire

<P>liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use of it.&nbsp; Promise

<P>me that, Laurie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anything you like, Sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good," thought the old gentleman.&nbsp; "You don't care now,

<P>but there'll come a time when that promise will keep you out

<P>of mischief, or I'm much mistaken."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while

<P>the iron was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit

<P>enough to rebel, they were off.&nbsp; During the time necessary for

<P>preparation, Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do

<P>in such cases.&nbsp; He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns,

<P>lost his appetite, neglected his dress and devoted much time

<P>to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled

<P>himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragic

<P>face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a

<P>heavy sense of guilt by day.&nbsp; Unlike some sufferers, he never

<P>spoke of his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not

<P>even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy.&nbsp; On

<P>some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but the weeks

<P>before his departure were very uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced

<P>that the `poor, dear fellow was going away to forget his

<P>trouble, and come home happy'.&nbsp; Of course, he smiled darkly at

<P>their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority of

<P>one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal

<P>certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert

<P>themselves.&nbsp; This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they

<P>tried to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well

<P>till Mrs. March kissed him, whit a whisper full of motherly

<P>solicitude.&nbsp; Then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily

<P>embraced them all round, not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and

<P>ran downstairs as if for his life.&nbsp; Jo followed a minute after
to

<P>wave her hand to him if he looked round.&nbsp; He did look round, came

<P>back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him,

<P>and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent

<P>and pathetic.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Jo, can't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was all, except a little pause.&nbsp; Then Laurie straightened

<P>himself up, said, "It's all right, never mind," and went away without

<P>another word.&nbsp; Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo did mind, for

<P>while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer,

<P>she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left

<P>her without a look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never

<P>would come again.
