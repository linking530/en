<P>"The first of June!&nbsp; The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow,

<P>and I'm free.&nbsp; Three months' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!"

<P>exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid

<P>upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took

<P>off her dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment

<P>of the whole party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo.

<P>"I was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her.&nbsp; If she

<P>had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is

<P>about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused.

<P>We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every

<P>time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that

<P>I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it

<P>impossible to part from me.&nbsp; I quaked till she was fairly in the

<P>carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped

<P>out her head, saying, `Josyphine, won't you--?' I didn't hear any

<P>more, for I basely turned and fled.&nbsp; I did actually run, and

<P>whisked round the corner whee I felt safe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor old Jo!&nbsp; She came in looking as if bears were after her,"

<P>said Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?" observed Amy,

<P>tasting her mixture critically.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; It's

<P>too warm to be particular about one's parts of speech," murmured

<P>Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall you do all your vacation?" asked Amy, changing

<P>the subject with tact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing," replied Meg, from

<P>the depths of the rocking chair.&nbsp; "I've been routed up early all

<P>winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now

<P>I'm going to rest and revel to my heart's content."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Jo, "that dozy way wouldn't suit me.&nbsp; I've laid

<P>in a heap of books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours

<P>reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I'm not having

<P>l..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't say `larks!'" implored Amy, as a return snub for the

<P>samphire' correction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll say `nightingales' then, with Laurie.&nbsp; That's proper

<P>and appropriate, since he's a warbler."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play

<P>all the time and rest, as the girls mean to," proposed Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind.&nbsp; I want to learn some

<P>new songs, and my children need fitting up for the summer.&nbsp; They

<P>are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May we, Mother?" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who

<P>sat sewing in what they called `Marmee's corner'.

<P>"You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like

<P>it.&nbsp; I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and
no

<P>work is as bad as all work and no play."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear, no!&nbsp; It will be delicious, I'm sure," said Meg

<P>complacently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I now propose a toast, as my `friend and pardner,

<P>Sairy Gamp', says.&nbsp; Fun forever, and no grubbing!"

<P>cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the lemonade went round.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by

<P>lounging for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Next morning, Meg did not

<P>appear till ten o'clock.&nbsp; Her solitary breakfast did not taste

<P>nice, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not

<P>filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's books lay

<P>scattered about.&nbsp; Nothing was neat and pleasant but `Marmee's

<P>corner', which looked as usual.&nbsp; And there Meg sat, to `rest and

<P>read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses

<P>she would get with her salary.&nbsp; Jo spent the morning on the river

<P>with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide,

<P>Wide World, up in the apple tree.&nbsp; Beth began by rummaging everything

<P>out of the big closet where her family resided, but getting

<P>tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy

<P>and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash.

<P>Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her

<P>curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone

<P>would see and inquire who the young artist was.&nbsp; As no one appeared

<P>but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest,

<P>she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had

<P>been a delightful, though unusually long day.&nbsp; Meg, who went shopping

<P>in the afternoon and got a `sweet blue muslin, had discovered,

<P>after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which

<P>mishap made her slightly cross.&nbsp; Jo had burned the skin off her

<P>nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long.&nbsp; Beth

<P>was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of

<P>learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the

<P>damage done her frock, for Katy Brown's party was to be the next

<P>day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had `nothing to wear'.&nbsp; But

<P>these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the

<P>experiment was working finely.&nbsp; She smiled, said nothing, and with

<P>Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and

<P>the domestic machinery running smoothly.&nbsp; It was astonishing what

<P>a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the

<P>`resting and reveling' process.&nbsp; The days kept getting longer and

<P>longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers, and

<P>unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of

<P>mischief for the idle hands to do.&nbsp; As the height of luxury, Meg

<P>put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that

<P>she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to

<P>furbish them up a`la Moffat.&nbsp; Jo read till her eyes gave out and

<P>she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie

<P>had a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately

<P>wished she had gone with Aunt March.&nbsp; Beth got on pretty well,

<P>for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and

<P>no work, and fell back into her old ways now and then.&nbsp; But something

<P>in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was much

<P>disturbed, so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor

<P>dear Joanna and told her she was a fright'.&nbsp; Amy fared worst of
all,

<P>for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her to amuse

<P>herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self

<P>a great burden.&nbsp; She didn't like dolls, fairy tales were childish,

<P>and one couldn't draw all the time.&nbsp; Tea parties didn't amount
to

<P>much neither did picnics unless very well conducted.&nbsp; "If one could

<P>have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer

<P>would be delightful, but to stay at home with three selfish sisters

<P>and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,"

<P>complained Miss Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure,

<P>fretting, and ennui.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but

<P>by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the

<P>week was nearly done.&nbsp; Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply,

<P>Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off

<P>the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and

<P>let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in

<P>the kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother

<P>anywhere to be seen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy on us!&nbsp; What has happened?" cried Jo, staring about

<P>her in dismay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved

<P>but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is

<P>going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best

<P>we can.&nbsp; It's a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act

<P>a bit like herself.&nbsp; But she says it has been a hard week for

<P>her, so we mustn't grumble but take care of ourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for

<P>something to do, that is, some new amusement, you know," added

<P>Jo quickly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little

<P>work, and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth

<P>of Hannah's saying, "Housekeeping ain't no joke."&nbsp; There was plenty

<P>of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and

<P>Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked

<P>about hard work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not

<P>to think of her, for she'd take care of herself," said Meg, who

<P>presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up

<P>with the cook's compliments.&nbsp; The boiled tea was very bitter, the

<P>omelet scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but

<P>Mrs. March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily

<P>over it after Jo was gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid,

<P>but they won't suffer, and it will do them good," she said,

<P>producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided

<P>herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their

<P>feelings might not be hurt, a motherly little deception for which

<P>they were grateful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of

<P>the head cook at her failures.&nbsp; "Never mind, I'll get the dinner

<P>and be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see

<P>company, and give orders," said Jo, who knew still less than Meg,

<P>about culinary affairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired

<P>to the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the

<P>litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble

<P>of dusting.&nbsp; Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a

<P>friendly desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in

<P>the office, inviting Laurie to dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having

<P>company," said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of poatoes, and I shall

<P>get some asparagus and a lobster, `for a relish', as Hannah says.

<P>We'll have lettuce and make a salad.&nbsp; I don't know how, but the

<P>book tells.&nbsp; I'll have blancmange and strawberries for dessert,

<P>and coffee too, if you want to be elegant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything

<P>but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.&nbsp; I wash my hands

<P>of the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own

<P>responsibility, you may just take care of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help

<P>to the pudding.&nbsp; You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle,

<P>won't you?" asked Jo, rather hurt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few

<P>trifles.&nbsp; You had better ask Mother's leave before you order

<P>anything," returned Meg prudently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course I shall.&nbsp; I'm not a fool."&nbsp; And Jo went off in
a

<P>huff at the doubts expressed of her powers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Get what you like, and don't disturb me.&nbsp; I'm going out to

<P>dinner and can't worry about things at home," said Mrs. March, when

<P>Jo spoke to her.&nbsp; "I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going
to

<P>take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably

<P>and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural

<P>phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a

<P>volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Everything is out of sorts, somehow," she said to herself,

<P>going downstairs.&nbsp; "There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that

<P>something is wrong in this family.&nbsp; If Amy is bothering, I'll

<P>shake her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the

<P>parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in

<P>the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if

<P>imploring the food for want of which he had died.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a

<P>drop left.&nbsp; Oh, Pip!&nbsp; Oh, Pip!&nbsp; How could I be so cruel
to you?"

<P>cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to

<P>restore him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and

<P>finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino

<P>box for a coffin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Put him in the oven, and maybe his will get warm and revive,"

<P>said Amy hopefully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead.&nbsp; I'll

<P>make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll

<P>never have another bird, never, my Pip!&nbsp; For I am too bad to own

<P>one," murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in

<P>her hands.

<P>"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.&nbsp; Now,

<P>don't cry, Bethy.&nbsp; It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week,

<P>and Pip has had the worst of the experiment.&nbsp; Make the shroud,
and

<P>lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice

<P>little funeral," said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken

<P>a good deal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen,

<P>which was in a most discouraging state of confusion.&nbsp; Putting on
a

<P>big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for

<P>washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's a sweet prospect!" muttered Jo, slamming the stove

<P>door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market

<P>while the water heated.&nbsp; The walk revived her spirits, and flattering

<P>herself that she had made good bargins, she trudged home again, after

<P>buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes

<P>of acid strawberries.&nbsp; By the time she got cleared up, the dinner

<P>arrived and the stove was red-hot.&nbsp; Hannah had left a pan of bread

<P>to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a

<P>second rising, and forgotten it.&nbsp; Meg was entertaining Sallie

<P>Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky,

<P>flushed, and disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I say, isn't bread `riz' enough when it runs over the pans?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows

<P>as high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and

<P>put the sour bread into the oven without further delay.&nbsp; Mrs. March

<P>went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also

<P>saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet,

<P>while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box.&nbsp; A strange

<P>sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet

<P>vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes

<P>later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.&nbsp; Now

<P>this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and

<P>inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw.

<P>They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply

<P>because she was old and poor and had few friends.&nbsp; So Meg gave
her

<P>the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions,

<P>critsized everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions

<P>which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became
a

<P>standing joke.&nbsp; Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best
alone,

<P>and discovered that something more than energy and good will is

<P>necessary to make a cook.&nbsp; She boiled the asparagus for an hour
and was

<P>grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.

<P>The bread burned black, for the salad dressing so aggravated her that

<P>she could not make it fit to ear.&nbsp; The lobster was a scarlet mystery
to

<P>her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager

<P>proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.&nbsp; The potatoes
had

<P>to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done

<P>at the last.&nbsp; The blancmange was lumpy, and the strawberries not
as

<P>ripe as they looked, having been skilfully `deaconed'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are

<P>hungry, only it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for

<P>nothing," thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than

<P>usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast

<P>spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss

<P>Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing

<P>after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked

<P>distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and

<P>laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive

<P>scene.&nbsp; Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared
it

<P>well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.&nbsp; Her hot
cheeks

<P>cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass

<P>plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy

<P>islands floating in a sea of cream.&nbsp; Miss Crocker tasted first,
made

<P>a wry face, and drank some water hastily.&nbsp; Jo, who refused, thinking

<P>there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking

<P>over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there

<P>was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his

<P>plate.&nbsp; Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful,

<P>choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, what is it?" exclaimed Jo, trembling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour," replied Meg

<P>with a tragic gesture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that

<P>she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of

<P>the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the

<P>milk in the refrigerator.&nbsp; She turned scarlet and was on the verge

<P>of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in

<P>spite of his heroic efforts.&nbsp; The comical side of the affair suddenly

<P>struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.&nbsp;
So

<P>did everyone else, even `Croaker' as the girls called the old lady,

<P>and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives

<P>and fun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will

<P>sober ourselves with a funeral," said Jo, as they rose, and Miss

<P>Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at

<P>another friend's dinner table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They did sober themselves for Beth's sake.&nbsp; Laurie dug a grave

<P>under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears

<P>by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath

<P>of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,

<P>composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here lies Pip March,

<P>Who died the 7th of June;

<P>Loved and lamented sore,

<P>And not forgotten soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room,

<P>overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose,

<P>for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged

<P>by beating up the pillows and putting things in order.&nbsp; Meg helped

<P>Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon

<P>and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and

<P>toast for supper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the

<P>sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.&nbsp; Mrs.

<P>March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the

<P>middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea

<P>of the success of one part of the experiment.

<P>Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and

<P>there was a scramble to get ready to see them.&nbsp; Then tea must be
got,

<P>errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until

<P>the last minute.&nbsp; As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one
they

<P>gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully,

<P>and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a dreadful day this has been!" began Jo, usually the first

<P>to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable," said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a bit like home," added Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip," sighed Beth,

<P>glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow,

<P>if you want it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them,

<P>looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want

<P>another week of it?" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the

<P>rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn

<P>toward the sun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't!" cried Jo decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nor I," echoed the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and

<P>live a little for others, do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lounging and larking doesn't pay," observed Jo, shaking her head.

<P>"I'm tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suppose you learn plain cooking.&nbsp; That's a useful accomplishment,

<P>which no woman should be without," said Mrs. March, laughing

<P>inaudibly at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had

<P>met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how

<P>we'd get on?" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on

<P>each doing her share faithfully.&nbsp; While Hannah and I did your work,

<P>you got on pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy

<P>or amiable.&nbsp; So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you

<P>what happens when everyone thinks only of herself.&nbsp; Don't you feel

<P>that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties

<P>which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear,

<P>that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We do, Mother we do!" cried the girls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again,

<P>for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and

<P>lighten as we learn to carry them.&nbsp; Work is wholesome, and there

<P>is plenty for everyone.&nbsp; It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is

<P>good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and

<P>independence better than money or fashion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't,"

<P>said Jo.&nbsp; "I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the

<P>dinner party I have shall be a success."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting

<P>you do it, Marmee.&nbsp; I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing.

<P>That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty

<P>nice enough as they are." said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with

<P>my music and dolls.&nbsp; I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying,

<P>not playing," was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example

<P>by heroically declaring, "I shall learn to make buttonholes, and

<P>attend to my parts of speech."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very good!&nbsp; Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and

<P>fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other

<P>extreme and delve like slaves.&nbsp; Have regular hours for work and
play,

<P>make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand

<P>the worth of time by employing it well.&nbsp; Then youth will be delightful,

<P>old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success,
in

<P>spite of poverty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We'll remember, Mother!"&nbsp; And they did.
