<P>Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but

<P>Hannah and the doctor suspected.&nbsp; The girls knew nothing about

<P>illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had

<P>everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a

<P>good deal to the excellent nurse.&nbsp; Meg stayed at home, lest she

<P>should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a

<P>little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of

<P>Beth's illness.&nbsp; She could not think it right to deceive her mother,

<P>but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of

<P>`Mrs. March bein' told, and worried just for sech a trifle.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for

<P>Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as

<P>she could control herself.&nbsp; But there came a time when during the

<P>fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on

<P>the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with

<P>a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she

<P>did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by

<P>wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother.&nbsp; Then Jo grew

<P>frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even

<P>Hannah said she `would think of it, though there was no danger

<P>yet'.&nbsp; A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr.

<P>March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a

<P>long while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house,

<P>and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and

<P>waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home.

<P>Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often

<P>on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious

<P>than any luxuries money could buy--in love, protection, peace, and

<P>health, the real blessings of life.&nbsp; Then it was that Jo, living
in

<P>the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before

<P>her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to

<P>see the beauty and to sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep

<P>and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the

<P>worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to live for others, and make

<P>home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may

<P>possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth,

<P>or beauty.&nbsp; And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home,
that

<P>she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or

<P>irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected

<P>tasks those willing hands had done for her.&nbsp; Laurie haunted the
house

<P>like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locke the grand piano, because

<P>he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to

<P>make the twilight pleasant for him.&nbsp; Everyone missed Beth.&nbsp;
The milkman,

<P>baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel

<P>came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud

<P>for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes,

<P>and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many

<P>friends shy little Beth had made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for

<P>even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.&nbsp;
She

<P>longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they

<P>should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety

<P>about Jo.&nbsp; She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her
mother

<P>that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to

<P>try to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him.

<P>But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay

<P>hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her

<P>lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment.

<P>Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a

<P>telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo

<P>never stirred from Beth's side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a

<P>bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready

<P>for its death.&nbsp; When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long
at

<P>Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it

<P>gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, "If Mrs. March can

<P>leave her husband she'd better be sent for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously,

<P>Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of

<P>her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale

<P>face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and

<P>throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm.&nbsp; She was soon

<P>back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in

<P>with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again.&nbsp; Jo read

<P>it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her

<P>heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly,

<P>"What is it?&nbsp; Is Beth worse?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've sent for Mother," said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots

<P>with a tragic expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good for you, Jo!&nbsp; Did you do it on your own responsibility?"

<P>asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the

<P>rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No.&nbsp; The doctor told us to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a

<P>startled face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it is.&nbsp; She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about

<P>the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall.

<P>She doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it.

<P>Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find

<P>Him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched

<P>out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark,

<P>and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a

<P>lump in his throat, "I'm here.&nbsp; Hold on tome, Jo, dear!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not speak, but she did `hold on', and the warm grasp

<P>of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to

<P>lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in

<P>her trouble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no

<P>fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her

<P>bent head as her mother used to do.&nbsp; It was the best thing he could

<P>have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo

<P>felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet

<P>solace which affection administers to sorrow.&nbsp; Soon she dried the

<P>tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now.&nbsp; I don't feel so forlorn,

<P>and will try to bear it if it comes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.&nbsp; Soon your

<P>mother will be here, and then everything will be all right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm so glad Father is better.&nbsp; Now she won't feel so bad about

<P>leaving him.&nbsp; Oh, me!&nbsp; It does seem as if all the troubles
came in

<P>a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo,

<P>spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Doesn't Meg pull fair?" asked Laurie, looking indignant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and

<P>she won't miss her as I shall.&nbsp; Beth is my conscience, and I can't

<P>give her up.&nbsp; I can't!&nbsp; I can't!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried

<P>despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed

<P>a tear.&nbsp; Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak

<P>till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his

<P>lips.&nbsp; It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad

<P>of it.&nbsp; Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, "I

<P>don't think she will die.&nbsp; She's so good, and we all love her so

<P>much, I don't believe God will take her away yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The good and dear people always do die," groaned Jo, but she

<P>stopped crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of

<P>her own doubts and fears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor girl, you're worn out.&nbsp; It isn't like you to be forlorn.

<P>Stop a bit.&nbsp; I'll hearten you up in a jiffy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied

<P>head down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of

<P>moving from the table where she left it.&nbsp; It must have possessed

<P>some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed

<P>to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass

<P>of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, "I drink--

<P>Health to my Beth!&nbsp; You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable

<P>friend.&nbsp; How can I ever pay you?" she added, as the wine

<P>refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you some-

<P>thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts

<P>of wine," said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed

<P>satisfaction at something.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is it?" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered

<P>she'd come at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will

<P>be all right.&nbsp; Aren't you glad I did it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute,

<P>for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing

<P>the girls or harming Beth.&nbsp; Jo grew quite white, flew out

<P>of her chair, and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him

<P>by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful

<P>cry, "Oh, Laurie!&nbsp; Oh, Mother!&nbsp; I am so glad!"&nbsp; She did
not weep

<P>again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her

<P>friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great

<P>presence of mind.&nbsp; He patted her back soothingly, and finding that

<P>she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which

<P>brought Jo round at once.&nbsp; Holding on to the banisters, she put

<P>him gently away, saying breathlessly, "Oh, don't!&nbsp; I didn't mean

<P>to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do

<P>it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't help flying at you.&nbsp; Tell

<P>me all about it, and don't give me wine again, it makes me act so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't mind," laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.&nbsp; "Why,

<P>you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.&nbsp; We thought Hannah was

<P>overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know.

<P>She'd never forgive us if Beth...&nbsp; Well, if anything happened,

<P>you know.&nbsp; So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something,

<P>and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober,

<P>and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram.&nbsp; I
never

<P>can bear to be `lorded over', so that settled my mind, and I did it.

<P>Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two A.M.

<P>I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up your rapture,

<P>and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie, you're an angel!&nbsp; How shall I ever thank you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fly at me again.&nbsp; I rather liked it," said Laurie, looking

<P>mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, thank you.&nbsp; I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes.

<P>Don't tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night.

<P>Bless you, Teddy, bless you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech,

<P>she vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down

<P>upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was "happy,

<P>oh, so happy!" while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a

<P>rather neat thing of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive

<P>him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away," said Hannah,

<P>with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter,

<P>while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah `knocked up a

<P>couple of pies in case of company unexpected".&nbsp; A breath of

<P>fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better

<P>than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.&nbsp; Everything appeared

<P>to feel the hopeful change.&nbsp; Beth's bird began to chirp again,

<P>and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the window.

<P>The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time

<P>the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged

<P>one another, whispering encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear!

<P>Mother's coming!"&nbsp; Every one rejoiced but Beth.&nbsp; She lay in
that

<P>heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger.

<P>It was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant,

<P>the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips

<P>quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough

<P>and tangled on the pillow.&nbsp; All day she say so, only rousing now

<P>and then to mutter, "Water!" with lips so parched they could

<P>hardly shape the word.&nbsp; All day Jo and Meg hovered over her,

<P>watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother, and

<P>all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours

<P>dragged slowly by.&nbsp; But night came at last, and every time

<P>the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of

<P>the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each

<P>hour brought help nearer.&nbsp; The doctor had been in to say that

<P>some change, for better or worse, would probably take place

<P>about midnight, at which time he would return.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's

<P>foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the

<P>parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than

<P>Mrs. March's countenance as she entered.&nbsp; Laurie lay on the rug,

<P>pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful

<P>look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them

<P>as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of

<P>powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If God spares Beth, I never will complain again," whispered

<P>Meg earnestly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my

<P>life," answered Jo, with equal fervor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I had no heart, it aches so," sighed Meg, after a pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever

<P>shall get through it," added her sister despondently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in

<P>watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face.

<P>The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the

<P>wind broke the deep hush.&nbsp; Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but

<P>the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the

<P>little bed.&nbsp; An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie's

<P>quiet departure for the station.&nbsp; Another hour, still no one came,

<P>and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way,

<P>or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking

<P>how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard

<P>a movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling

<P>before their mother's easy chair with her face hidden.&nbsp; A dreadful

<P>fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg

<P>is afraid to tell me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited

<P>eyes a great change seemed to have taken place.&nbsp; The fever flush

<P>and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked

<P>so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to

<P>weep or to lament.&nbsp; Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters,

<P>she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly

<P>whispered, "Goodby, my Beth.&nbsp; Goodby!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep,

<P>hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at

<P>her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down

<P>to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, "The fever's

<P>turned, she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes

<P>easy.&nbsp; Praise be given!&nbsp; Oh, my goodness me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor

<P>came to confirm it.&nbsp; He was a homely man, but they thought his

<P>face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look

<P>at them, "Yes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through

<P>this time.&nbsp; Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes,

<P>give her..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into

<P>the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close,

<P>rejoicing with hearts too full for words.&nbsp; When they went back
to

<P>be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying,

<P>as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the

<P>dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen

<P>asleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Mother would only come now!" said Jo, as the winter night

<P>began to wane.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"See," said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose,

<P>"I thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand

<P>tomorrow if she--went away from us.&nbsp; But it has blossomed in the

<P>night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when

<P>the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little

<P>rose, and Mother's face."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the

<P>world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo,

<P>as they looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad

<P>vigil was done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It looks like a fairy world," said Meg, smiling to herself,

<P>as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hark!" cried Jo, starting to her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry

<P>from Hannah, and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper,

<P>"Girls, she's come!&nbsp; She's come!"
