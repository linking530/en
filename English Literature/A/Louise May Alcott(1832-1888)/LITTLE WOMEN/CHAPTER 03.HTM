<P>"Jo!&nbsp; Jo!&nbsp; Where are you?" cried Meg at the foot of the garret
stairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here!" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up,

<P>Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of

<P>Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa

<P>by the sunny window.&nbsp; This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she

<P>loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy

<P>the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't

<P>mind her a particle.&nbsp; As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his

<P>hole.&nbsp; Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the
news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such fun!&nbsp; Only see!&nbsp; A regular note of invitation from Mrs.

<P>Gardiner for tomorrow night!" cried Meg, waving the precious paper

<P>and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine

<P>at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go,

<P>now what shall we wear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear

<P>our poplins, because we haven't got anything else?" answered Jo

<P>with her mouth full.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I only had a silk!" sighed Meg.&nbsp; "Mother says I may when

<P>I'm eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for

<P>us.&nbsp; Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear
in

<P>mine.&nbsp; Whatever shall I do?&nbsp; The burn shows badly, and I can't
take

<P>any out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight.

<P>The front is all right.&nbsp; I shall have a new ribbon for my hair,
and

<P>Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are

<P>lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones,

<P>so I shall have to go without," said Jo, who never troubled herself

<P>much about dress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must have gloves, or I won't go," cried Meg decidedly.

<P>"Gloves are more important than anything else.&nbsp; You can't dance

<P>without them, and if you don't I should be so mortified."

<P>"Then I'll stay still.&nbsp; I don't care much for company dancing.

<P>It's no fun to go sailing round.&nbsp; I like to fly about and cut capers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and

<P>you are so careless.&nbsp; She said when you spoiled the others that
she

<P>shouldn't get you any more this winter.&nbsp; Can't you make them do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know

<P>how stained they are.&nbsp; That's all I can do.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I'll
tell you how

<P>we can manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.&nbsp; Don't

<P>you see?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove

<P>dreadfully," began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I'll go without.&nbsp; I don't care what people say!" cried Jo,

<P>taking up her book.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may have it, you may!&nbsp; Only don't stain it, and do behave

<P>nicely.&nbsp; Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say `Christopher

<P>Columbus!' will you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't worry about me.&nbsp; I'll be as prim ad I can and not get

<P>into any scrapes, if I can help it.&nbsp; Now go and answer your note,

<P>and let me finish this splendid story."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Meg went away to `accept with thanks', look over her dress,

<P>and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo

<P>finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with

<P>Scrabble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger

<P>girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the

<P>all-important business of `getting ready for the party'.&nbsp; Simple

<P>as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down,

<P>laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair

<P>pervaded the house.&nbsp; Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and
Jo

<P>undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ought they to smoke like that?" asked Beth from her perch

<P>on the bed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's the dampness drying," replied Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a queer smell!&nbsp; It's like burned feathers," observed Amy,

<P>smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud

<P>of little ringlets," said Jo, putting down the tongs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared,

<P>for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser

<P>laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?&nbsp; I'm spoiled!&nbsp; I can't go!&nbsp;
My

<P>hair, oh, my hair!" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven

<P>frizzle on her forehead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just my luck!&nbsp; You shouldn't have asked me to do it.&nbsp; I always

<P>spoil everything.&nbsp; I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and
so

<P>I've made a mess," groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black

<P>pancakes with tears of regret.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It isn't spoiled.&nbsp; Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so

<P>the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the

<P>last fashion.&nbsp; I've seen many girls do it so," said Amy consolingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Serves me right for trying to be fine.&nbsp; I wish I'd let my hair

<P>alone," cried Meg petulantly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.&nbsp; But it will soon grow

<P>out again," said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and

<P>by the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up

<P>and her dress on.&nbsp; They looked very well in their simple suits,

<P>Meg's in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and

<P>the pearl pin.&nbsp; Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen

<P>collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament.

<P>Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and

<P>all pronounced the effect "quite easy and fine".&nbsp; Meg's high-heeled

<P>slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it,

<P>and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head,

<P>which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant

<P>or die.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have a good time, dearies!" said Mrs. March, as the sisters

<P>went daintily down the walk.&nbsp; "Don't eat much supper, and come

<P>away at eleven when I send Hannah for you."&nbsp; As the gate clashed

<P>behind them, a voice cried from a window...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Girls, girls!&nbsp; Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers," cried Jo,

<P>adding with a laugh as they went on, "I do believe Marmee would ask

<P>that if we were all running away from an earthquake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a

<P>real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,"

<P>replied Meg, who had a good many little `aristocratic tastes' of

<P>her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo.

<P>Is my sash right?&nbsp; And does my hair look very bad?" said Meg, as

<P>she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after

<P>a prolonged prink.

<P>"I know I shall forget.&nbsp; If you see me doing anything wrong,

<P>just remind me by a wink, will you?" returned Jo, giving her

<P>collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, winking isn't ladylike.&nbsp; I'll lift my eyebrows if any

<P>thing is wrong, and nod if you are all right.&nbsp; Now hold your

<P>shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if

<P>you are introduced to anyone.&nbsp; It isn't the thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you learn all the proper ways?&nbsp; I never can.&nbsp; Isn't

<P>that music gay?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went

<P>to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an

<P>event to them.&nbsp; Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them

<P>kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters.

<P>Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't

<P>care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back

<P>carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a

<P>colt in a flower garden.&nbsp; Half a dozen jovial lads were talking

<P>about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go

<P>and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.&nbsp; She

<P>telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly

<P>that she dared not stir.&nbsp; No one came to talk to her, and one by

<P>one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.&nbsp; She could

<P>not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would

<P>show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing

<P>began.&nbsp; Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped

<P>about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their

<P>wearer suffered smilingly.&nbsp; Jo saw a big red headed youth

<P>approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she

<P>slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy

<P>herself in peace.&nbsp; Unfortunately, another bashful person had

<P>chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her,

<P>she found herself face to face with the `Laurence boy'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!" stammered Jo,

<P>preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked

<P>a little startled, "Don't mind me, stay if you like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shan't I disturb you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a bit.&nbsp; I only came here because I don't know many

<P>people and felt rather strange at first, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So did I.&nbsp; Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo

<P>said, trying to be polite and easy, "I think I've had the pleasure

<P>of seeing you before.&nbsp; You live near us, don't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Next door."&nbsp; And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's

<P>prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted

<P>about cricket when he brought the cat home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in

<P>her heartiest way, "We did have such a good time over your nice

<P>Christmas present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Grandpa sent it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is your cat, Miss March?" asked the boy, trying to look

<P>sober while his black eyes shone with fun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.&nbsp; But I am not Miss March, I'm

<P>only Jo," returned the young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie Laurence, what an odd name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My first name is theodore, but I don't like it, for the

<P>fellows called me Dora, so I made the say Laurie instead."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hate my name, too, so sentimental!&nbsp; I wish every one would

<P>say Jo instead of Josephine.&nbsp; How did you make the boys stop calling

<P>you Dora?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thrashed `em."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear

<P>it."&nbsp; And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?" asked Laurie, looking

<P>as if he thought the name suited her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone

<P>is lively.&nbsp; In a place like this I'm sure to upset something,

<P>tread on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out

<P>of mischief and let Meg sail about.&nbsp; Don't you dance?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sometimes.&nbsp; You see I've been abroad a good many years, and

<P>haven't been into company enough yet to know how you do things here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Abroad!." cried Jo.&nbsp; "Oh, tell me about it!&nbsp; I love dearly
to

<P>hear people describe their travels."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager

<P>questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at

<P>school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of

<P>boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about

<P>Switzerland with their teachers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't I wish I'd been there!" cried Jo.&nbsp; "Did you go to Paris?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We spent last winter there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can you talk French?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do say some!&nbsp; I can read it, but can't pronounce."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How nicely you do it!&nbsp; Let me see...you said, `Who is the

<P>young lady in the pretty slippers', didn't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oui, mademoiselle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!&nbsp; Do you think

<P>she is pretty?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so

<P>fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her

<P>sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg.&nbsp; Both peeped and

<P>critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances.&nbsp;
Laurie's

<P>bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and

<P>set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her

<P>dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her.&nbsp; She

<P>liked the `Laurence boy' better than ever and took several good

<P>looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they

<P>had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown

<P>creatures to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose,

<P>fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite,

<P>for a boy, and altogether jolly.&nbsp; Wonder how old he is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked

<P>herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a

<P>round-about way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suppose you are going to college soon?&nbsp; I see you pegging

<P>away at your books, no, I mean studying hard."&nbsp; And Jo blushed

<P>at the dreadful `pegging' which had escaped her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a

<P>shrug.&nbsp; "Not for a year or two.&nbsp; I won't go before seventeen,

<P>anyway."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aren't you but fifteen?" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad,

<P>whom she had imagined seventeen already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sixteen, next month."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How I wish I was going to college!&nbsp; You don't look as if

<P>you liked it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hate it!&nbsp; Nothing but grinding or skylarking.&nbsp; And I don't

<P>like the way fellows do either, in this country."

<P>"What do you like?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his

<P>black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she

<P>changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, "That's a

<P>splendid polka!&nbsp; Why don't you go and try it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you will come too," he answered, with a gallant little bow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't, for I told meg I wouldn't, because..." There Jo

<P>stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because, what?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You won't tell?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so

<P>I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely

<P>mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would

<P>see it.&nbsp; You may laugh, if you want to.&nbsp; It is funny, I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Laurie didn't laugh.&nbsp; He only looked dawn a minute, and

<P>the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently,

<P>"Never mind that.&nbsp; I'll tell you how we can manage.&nbsp; There's
a long

<P>hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us.

<P>Please come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves

<P>when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.&nbsp; The

<P>hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well,

<P>and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of

<P>swing and spring.&nbsp; When the music stopped, they sat down on the

<P>stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account

<P>of a students' festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of

<P>her sister.&nbsp; She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into
a

<P>side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and

<P>looking pale.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've sprained my ankle.&nbsp; That stupid high heel turned and

<P>gave me a sad wrench.&nbsp; It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't

<P>know how I'm ever going to get home," she said, rocking to and fro

<P>in pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes.&nbsp; I'm

<P>sorry.&nbsp; But I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage,
or

<P>stay here all night," answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as

<P>she spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much.&nbsp; I

<P>dare say I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own,

<P>and it's a long way to the stable, and no one to send."

<P>"I'll go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed!&nbsp; It's past nine, and dark as Egypt.&nbsp; I can't
stop

<P>here, for the house is full.&nbsp; Sallie has some girls staying with
her.

<P>I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll ask Laurie.&nbsp; He will go," said Jo," looking relieved as

<P>the idea occurred to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy, no!&nbsp; Don't ask or tell anyone.&nbsp; Get me my rubbers,
and

<P>put these slippers with our things.&nbsp; I can't dance anymore, but
as

<P>soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she

<P>comes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are going out to supper now.&nbsp; I'll stay with you.&nbsp; I'd

<P>rather."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.&nbsp; I'm so tired

<P>I can't stir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering

<P>away to the dining room, which she found after going into a

<P>china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner

<P>was taking a little private refreshment.&nbsp; Making a dart at the

<P>table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled,

<P>thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!" exclaimed Jo, finishing

<P>Meg's glove by scrubbing her gown with it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can I help you?" said a friendly voice.&nbsp; And there was Laurie,

<P>with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and

<P>someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state," answered Jo,

<P>glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Too bad!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was looking for someone to give this to.&nbsp;
May I

<P>take it to your sister?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, thank you!&nbsp; I'll show you where she is.&nbsp; I don't offer
to

<P>take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie

<P>drew up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and

<P>ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced

<P>him a `nice boy'.&nbsp; They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes,

<P>and were in the midst of a quiet game of BUZZ, with two or three

<P>other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.&nbsp; Meg

<P>forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch

<P>hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hush!&nbsp; Don't say anything," she whispered, adding aloud, "It's

<P>nothing.&nbsp; I turned my foot a little, that's all," and limped upstairs

<P>to put her things on.

<P>Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till

<P>se decided to take things into her own hands.&nbsp; Slipping out, she
ran

<P>down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage.

<P>It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the

<P>neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had

<P>heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage,

<P>which had just come for him, he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's so early!&nbsp; You can't mean to go yet?" began Jo.&nbsp; looking

<P>relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I always go early, I do, truly!&nbsp; Please let me take you home.

<P>It's all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully

<P>accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.&nbsp; Hannah

<P>hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they

<P>rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive

<P>and elegant.&nbsp; Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot
up,

<P>and the girls talked over their party in freedom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had a capital time.&nbsp; Did you?' asked Jo, rumpling up her

<P>hair, and making herself comfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, till I hurt myself.&nbsp; Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took

<P>a fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when

<P>Sallie does.&nbsp; She is going in the spring when the opera comes,
and

<P>it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go," answered

<P>Meg, cheering up at the thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.&nbsp; Was

<P>he nice?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh.&nbsp; very!&nbsp; His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very
polite,

<P>and I had a delicious redowa with him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step.

<P>Laurie and I couldn't help laughing.&nbsp; Did you hear us?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, but it was very rude.&nbsp; What were you about all that time,

<P>hidden away there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they

<P>were at home.&nbsp; With many thanks, they said good night and crept
in,

<P>hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two

<P>little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell about the party!&nbsp; Tell about the party!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With what Meg called `a great want of manners' Jo had saved some

<P>bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing

<P>the most thrilling events of the evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to

<P>come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown

<P>wit a maid to wait on me," said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with

<P>arnica and brushed her hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more

<P>than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece

<P>and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough

<P>to wear them," And I think Jo was quite right.
