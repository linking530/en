<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are

<P>married, when `Vive la liberte!' becomes their motto.&nbsp; In America,

<P>as everyone knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence,

<P>and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons

<P>usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a

<P>seclusion almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means

<P>as quiet.&nbsp; Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put

<P>upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most

<P>of them might exclaim, as did a very pretty woman the other day,

<P>"I'm as handsome as ever, but no one takes any notice of me because

<P>I'm married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not

<P>experience this affliction till her babies were a year old,

<P>for in her little world primitive customs prevailed, and she

<P>found herself more admired and beloved than ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct

<P>was very strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children,

<P>to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else.&nbsp; Day

<P>and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and

<P>anxiety, leaving John to the tender mercies of the help, for

<P>an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen department.&nbsp; Being

<P>a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely attentions he

<P>had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored his babies, he

<P>cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing with

<P>masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.&nbsp; But

<P>three months passed, and there was no return of repose.&nbsp; Meg

<P>looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of

<P>her time, the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took

<P>life `aisy', kept him on short commons.&nbsp; When he went out in

<P>the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive

<P>mamma, if he came gaily in at night, eager to embrace his

<P>family, he was quenched by a "Hush!&nbsp; They are just asleep after

<P>worrying all day."&nbsp; If he proposed a little amusement at home,

<P>"No, it would disturb the babies."&nbsp; If he hinted at a lecture

<P>or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a

<P>decided "Leave my children for pleasure, never!"&nbsp; His sleep was

<P>broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing

<P>noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night.&nbsp; His meals

<P>were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius,

<P>who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from

<P>the nest above.&nbsp; And when he read his paper of an evening,

<P>Demi's colic got into the shipping list and Daisy's fall affected

<P>the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic
news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had

<P>bereft him of his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual

<P>`hushing' made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever

<P>he entered the sacred precincts of Babyland.&nbsp; He bore it very

<P>patiently for six months, and when no signs of amendment appeared,

<P>he did what other paternal exiles do--tried to get a little comfort

<P>elsewhere.&nbsp; Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not

<P>far off, and John fell into the way of running over for an hour

<P>or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his

<P>own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.&nbsp; Mrs.

<P>Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be

<P>agreeable, and she performed her mission most successfully.&nbsp; The

<P>parlor was always bright and attractive, the chessboard ready,

<P>the piano in tune, plenty of gay gossip, and a nice little supper

<P>set forth in tempting style.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not

<P>been so lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best

<P>thing and enjoyed his neighbor's society.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and

<P>found it a relief to know that John was having a good time

<P>instead of dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house

<P>and waking the children.&nbsp; But by-and-by, when the teething

<P>worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours,

<P>leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and find

<P>her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite

<P>in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers

<P>on the fender.&nbsp; She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt

<P>injured because he did not know that she wanted him without

<P>being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited

<P>for her in vain.&nbsp; She was nervous and worn out with watching

<P>and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best

<P>of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress

<P>them.&nbsp; Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much

<P>devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them

<P>feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," she would say, looking in the glass, "I'm getting

<P>old and ugly.&nbsp; John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so

<P>he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor,

<P>who has no incumbrances.&nbsp; Well, the babies love me, they don't

<P>care if I am thin and pale and haven't time to crimp my hair,

<P>they are my comfort, and some day John will see what I've

<P>gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo,

<P>or Demi with a crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for

<P>a maternal revel, which soothed her solitude for the time being.

<P>But the pain increased as politics absorbed John, who was always

<P>running over to discuss interesting points with Scott, quite

<P>unconscious that Meg missed him.&nbsp; Not a word did she say, however,

<P>till her mother found her in tears one day, and insisted

<P>on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping spirits had

<P>not escaped her observation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really

<P>do need advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well

<P>be widowed," replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's

<P>bib with an injured air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Goes on how, my dear?" asked her mother anxiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's away all day, and at night when I want to see him,

<P>he is continually going over to the Scotts'.&nbsp; It isn't fair

<P>that I should have the hardest work, and never any amusement.

<P>Men are very selfish, even the best of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So are women.&nbsp; Don't blame John till you see where you

<P>are wrong yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But it can't be right for him to neglect me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you neglect him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault

<P>is yours, Meg."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't see how."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let me show you.&nbsp; Did John ever neglect you, as you call it,

<P>while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening,

<P>his only leisure time?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think you could, dear, and I think you ought.&nbsp; May I

<P>speak quite freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who

<P>blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed I will!&nbsp; Speak to me as if I were little Meg again.

<P>I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these

<P>babies look to me for everything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little

<P>interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly

<P>together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one

<P>than ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make-forgotten

<P>your duty to your husband in your love for your children.

<P>A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that

<P>had better be remedied before you take to different ways, for

<P>children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as

<P>if they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support

<P>them.&nbsp; I've seen it for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling

<P>sure it would come right in time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid it won't.&nbsp; If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm

<P>jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea.&nbsp; He doesn't

<P>see that I want him, and I don't know how to tell him without

<P>words."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away.&nbsp; My dear,

<P>he's longing for his little home, but it isn't home without you,

<P>and you are always in the nursery."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oughtn't I to be there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous,

<P>and then you are unfitted for everything.&nbsp; Besides, you owe

<P>something to John as well as to the babies.&nbsp; Don't neglect husband

<P>for children, don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach

<P>him how to help in it.&nbsp; His place is there as well as yours, and

<P>the children need him.&nbsp; Let him feel that he has a part to do,
and

<P>he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you

<P>all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You really think so, Mother?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice

<P>unless I've proved its practicability.&nbsp; When you and Jo were little,

<P>I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless

<P>I devoted myself wholly to you.&nbsp; Poor Father took to his books,

<P>after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment

<P>alone.&nbsp; I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was

<P>too much for me.&nbsp; I nearly spoiled her by indulgence.&nbsp; You
were

<P>poorly, and I worried about you till I fell sick myself.&nbsp; Then

<P>Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made

<P>himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been able

<P>to got on without him since.&nbsp; That is the secret of our home happiness.

<P>He does not let business wean him from the little cares

<P>and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries

<P>destroy my interest in his pursuits.&nbsp; Each do our part alone in

<P>many things, but at home we work together, always."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband

<P>and children what you have been to yours.&nbsp; Show me how, I'll do

<P>anything you say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were always my docile daughter.&nbsp; Well, dear, if I were

<P>you, I'd let John have more to do with the management of Demi,

<P>for the boy needs training, and it's none too soon to begin.

<P>Then I'd do what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and

<P>help you.&nbsp; She is a capital nurse, and you may trust the precious

<P>babies to her while you do more housework.&nbsp; You need the exercise,

<P>Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his wife again.

<P>Go out more, keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the

<P>sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no

<P>fair weather.&nbsp; Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John

<P>likes--talk with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and

<P>help each other in that way.&nbsp; Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox

<P>because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and

<P>educate yourself to take your part in the world's work, for it

<P>all affects you and yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if

<P>I ask questions about politics and things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't believe he would.&nbsp; Love covers a multitude of sins,

<P>and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?&nbsp; Try it, and

<P>see if he doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs.

<P>Scott's suppers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will.&nbsp; Poor John!&nbsp; I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly,

<P>but I thought I was right, and he never said anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn,

<P>I fancy.&nbsp; This is just the time, Meg, when young married people

<P>are apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be

<P>most together, for the first tenderness soon wears off, unless

<P>care is taken to preserve it.&nbsp; And no time is so beautiful and

<P>precious to parents as the first years of the little lives

<P>given to them to train.&nbsp; Don't let John be a stranger to the

<P>babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in

<P>this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and

<P>through them you will learn to know and love one another as

<P>you should.&nbsp; Now, dear, good-by.&nbsp; Think over Mother's preachment,

<P>act upon it if it seems good, and God bless you all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it,

<P>though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned

<P>to have it.&nbsp; Of course the children tyrannized over her, and

<P>ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and

<P>squalling brought them whatever they wanted.&nbsp; Mamma was an

<P>abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not so easily

<P>subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by

<P>an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son.

<P>For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness of character,

<P>we won't call it obstinacy, and when he made up his

<P>little to have or to do anything, all the king's horses and

<P>all the king's men could not change that pertinacious little

<P>mind.&nbsp; Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer

<P>his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was too

<P>soon to learn obedience.&nbsp; So Master Demi early discovered that

<P>when he undertook to `wrastle' with `Parpar', he always got

<P>the worst of it, yet like the Englishman, baby respected the

<P>man who conquered him, and loved the father whose grave "No,

<P>no," was more impressive than all Mamma's love pats.

<P>A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved

<P>to try a social evening with John, so she ordered a nice

<P>supper, set the parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and

<P>put the children to bed early, that nothing should interfere

<P>with her experiment.&nbsp; But unfortunately Demi's most unconquerable

<P>prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he decided

<P>to go on a rampage.&nbsp; So poor Meg sang and rocked,

<P>told stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could

<P>devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long

<P>after Daisy had gone to byelow, like the chubby little bunch

<P>of good nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light,

<P>with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs

<P>down and gives poor Papa his tea?" asked Meg, as the hall

<P>door softly closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing

<P>into the dining room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me has tea!" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast,

<P>if you'll go bye-by like Daisy.&nbsp; Will you, lovey?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Iss!" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep

<P>and hurry the desired day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped

<P>away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face

<P>and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial

<P>admiration.&nbsp; He saw it at once and said with pleased surprise,

<P>"Why, little mother, how gay we are tonight.&nbsp; Do you expect

<P>company?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only you, dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a

<P>change.&nbsp; You always make yourself nice for table, no matter

<P>how tired you are, so why shouldn't I when I have the time?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do it out of respect for you, my dear," said old-fashioned John.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke," laughed Meg, looking young

<P>and pretty again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times.&nbsp; This

<P>tastes right.&nbsp; I drink your health, dear."&nbsp; And John sipped
his

<P>tea with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short

<P>duration however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle

<P>rattled mysteriously, and a little voice was heard, saying impatiently

<P>...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Opy doy.&nbsp; Me's tummin!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's that naughty boy.&nbsp; I told him to go to sleep alone,

<P>and here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering

<P>over that canvas," said Meg, answering the call.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mornin' now," announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered,

<P>with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and

<P>every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing

<P>the `cakies' with loving glances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it isn't morning yet.&nbsp; You must go to bed, and not

<P>trouble poor Mamma.&nbsp; Then you can have the little cake with

<P>sugar on it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me loves Parpar," said the artful one, preparing to climb

<P>the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys.&nbsp; But John shook

<P>his head, and said to Meg...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone,

<P>make him do it, or he will never learn to mind you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, of course.&nbsp; Come, Demi."&nbsp; And Meg led her son away,

<P>feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped

<P>beside her, laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to

<P>be administered as soon as they reached the nursery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman

<P>actually gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed,

<P>and forbade any more promenades till morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Iss!" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar,

<P>and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing

<P>pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again and exposed

<P>the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, "More sudar,

<P>Marmar."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now this won't do," said John, hardening his heart against

<P>the engaging little sinner.&nbsp; "We shall never know any peace till

<P>that child learns togo to bed properly.&nbsp; You have made a slave
of

<P>yourself long enough.&nbsp; Give him one lesson, and then there will

<P>be an end of it.&nbsp; Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll manage him.&nbsp; Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed,

<P>as Mamma bids you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"S'ant!" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the

<P>coveted `cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must never say that to Papa.&nbsp; I shall carry you if you

<P>don't go yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go 'way, me don't love Parpar."&nbsp; And Demi retired to his

<P>mother's skirts for protection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered

<P>over to the enemy, with a "Be gentle with him, John,"

<P>which struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted

<P>him, then the judgment day was at hand.&nbsp; Bereft of his cake,

<P>defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to

<P>that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but

<P>openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the

<P>way upstairs.&nbsp; The minute he was put into bed on one side, he

<P>rolled out on the other, and made for the door, only to be

<P>ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and

<P>put back again, which lively performance was kept up till the

<P>young man's strength gave out, when he devoted himself to

<P>roaring at the top of his voice.&nbsp; This vocal exercise usually

<P>conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post which is

<P>popularly believed to be deaf.&nbsp; No coaxing, no sugar, no

<P>lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the

<P>red glow of the fire enlivened the `big dark' which Demi

<P>regarded with curiosity rather than fear.&nbsp; This new order

<P>of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for `Marmar',

<P>as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his

<P>tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.&nbsp; The

<P>plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to

<P>Meg's heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, my dear.&nbsp; I've told him he must go to sleep, as you

<P>bid him, and he must, if I stay here all night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But he'll cry himself sick," pleaded Meg, reproaching herself

<P>for deserting her boy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then

<P>the matter is settled, for he will understand that he has got to

<P>mind.&nbsp; Don't interfere, I'll manage him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by

<P>indulgence.&nbsp; Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed,

<P>and never regretted her docility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please let me kiss him once, John?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and
rest,

<P>for she is very tired with taking care of you all day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory,

<P>for after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite

<P>still at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his

<P>anguish of mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying.&nbsp; I'll

<P>cover him up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest." thought

<P>John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious

<P>heir asleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him,

<P>Demi's eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put

<P>up his arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, "Me's dood, now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long

<P>silence which followed the uproar, and after imagining all

<P>sorts of impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to

<P>set her fears at rest.&nbsp; Demi lay fast asleep, not in his usual

<P>spreadeagle attitude, but in a subdued bunch, cuddled close in

<P>the circle of his father's arm and holding his father's finger,

<P>as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and had

<P>gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.&nbsp; So held, John had waited

<P>with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold,

<P>and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle

<P>with his son than with his whole day's work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she

<P>smiled to herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a

<P>satisfied tone, "I never need fear that John will be too harsh

<P>with my babies.&nbsp; He does know how to manage them, and will be

<P>a great help, for Demi is getting too much for me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive

<P>or reproachful wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg

<P>placidly trimming a bonnet, and to be greeted with the request

<P>to read something about the election, if he was not

<P>too tired.&nbsp; John saw in a minute that a revolution of some

<P>kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing

<P>that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't

<P>keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would

<P>soon appear.&nbsp; He read a long debate with the most amiable

<P>readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner,

<P>while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent

<P>questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the

<P>state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.&nbsp; In her secret

<P>soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics,

<P>and the the mission of politicians seemed to be calling

<P>each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself,

<P>and when John paused, shook her head and said with what she

<P>thought diplomatic ambiguity, "Well, I really don't see what

<P>we are coming to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised

<P>a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand,

<P>and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue

<P>had failed to waken.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and

<P>like millinery for hers, that's only fair," thought John the Just,

<P>adding aloud, "That's very pretty.&nbsp; Is it what you call a breakfast
cap?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear man, it's a bonnet!&nbsp;&nbsp; My very best go-to-concert-and-theater
bonnet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook

<P>it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear.

<P>How do you keep it on?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so."

<P>And Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding

<P>him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for

<P>it looks young and happy again."&nbsp; And John kissed the smiling

<P>face, to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one

<P>of the new concerts some night.&nbsp; I really need some music to

<P>put me in tune.&nbsp; Will you, please?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you

<P>like.&nbsp; You have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of

<P>good, and I shall enjoy it, of all things.&nbsp; What put it into

<P>your head, little mother?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told

<P>her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she

<P>said I needed change and less care, so Hannah is to help me

<P>with the children, and I'm to see to things about the house more,

<P>and now and then have a little fun, just to keep me from getting

<P>to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my time.&nbsp; It's

<P>only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your sake

<P>as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully

<P>lately, and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I

<P>can.&nbsp; You don't object, I hope?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape

<P>the little bonnet had from utter ruin.&nbsp; All that we have any

<P>business to know is that John did not appear to object, judging

<P>from the changes which gradually took place in the house

<P>and its inmates.&nbsp; It was not all Paradise by any means, but

<P>everyone was better for the division of labor system.&nbsp; The

<P>children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate, stedfast

<P>John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg

<P>recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of

<P>wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential

<P>conversation with her sensible husband.&nbsp; Home grew homelike

<P>again, and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg

<P>with him.&nbsp; The Scotts came to the Brookes' now, and everyone

<P>found the little house a cheerful place, full of happiness,

<P>content, and family love.&nbsp; Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go

<P>there.&nbsp; "It is always so quiet and pleasant here, it does me

<P>good, Meg," she used to say, looking about her with wistful

<P>eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use

<P>it in her great house, full of splendid lonliness, for there

<P>were no riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in

<P>a world of lis own, where there was no place for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This household happiness did not come all at once, but

<P>John and Meg had found the key to it, and each year of Married

<P>life taught them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries

<P>of real home love and mutual helpfulness, which the poorest

<P>may possess, and the richest cannot buy.&nbsp; This is the sort

<P>of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be

<P>laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world,

<P>finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who

<P>cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking

<P>side by side, through fair and stormy weather, with a faithful

<P>friend, who is, in the true sense of the good old Saxon word,

<P>the `house-band', and learning, as Meg learned, that a woman's

<P>happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling

<P>it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.
