<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped

<P>and loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters

<P>that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie

<P>said.&nbsp; The second year began rather soberly, for their prospects

<P>did not brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly.&nbsp; But when their

<P>first sorrow was over--for they loved the old lady in spite

<P>of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause for rejoicing,

<P>for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful

<P>things possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for

<P>of course you intend to sell it," said Laurie, as they were all

<P>talking the matter over some weeks later.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I don't," was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the

<P>fat poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former

<P>mistress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't mean to live there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a

<P>power of money to keep it in order.&nbsp; The garden and orchard alone

<P>need two or three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take

<P>it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you expect to live on the produce of the place?&nbsp; Well,

<P>that sounds paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one," And

<P>Jo laughed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Boys.&nbsp; I want to open a school for little lads--a good,

<P>happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz

<P>to teach them."

<P>"That's a truly Joian plan for you!&nbsp; Isn't that just like

<P>her?" cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much

<P>surprised as he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like it," said Mrs. March decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So do I," added her husband, who welcomed the thought of

<P>a chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern

<P>youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will be an immense care for Jo," said Meg, stroking

<P>the head or her one all-absorbing son.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo can do it, and be happy in it.&nbsp; It's a splendid idea.

<P>Tell us all about it," cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing

<P>to lend the lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his

<P>help.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew you'd stand by me, sir.&nbsp; Amy does too--I see it in

<P>her eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind

<P>before she speaks.&nbsp; Now, my dear people," continued Jo earnestly,

<P>"just understand that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long

<P>cherished plan.&nbsp; Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, when

<P>I'd made my fortune, and no one needed me at home, I'd hire a

<P>big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn't

<P>any mothers, and take care of them, and make life jolly for them

<P>before it was too late.&nbsp; I see so many going to ruin for want of

<P>help at the right minute, I love so to do anything for them, I

<P>seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and

<P>oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling,

<P>with tears in her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way,

<P>which they had not seen for a long while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what

<P>he would like, and agreed to try it when we got rich.&nbsp; Bless his

<P>dear heart, he's been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, I

<P>mean, not getting rich, that he'll never be.&nbsp; Money doesn't stay

<P>in his pocket long enough to lay up any.&nbsp; But now, thanks to my

<P>good old aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich,

<P>at least I feel so, and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well,

<P>if we have a flourishing school.&nbsp; It's just the place for boys,

<P>the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain.&nbsp; There's

<P>plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside.

<P>They could help in the garden and orchard.&nbsp; Such work is healthy,

<P>isn't it, sir?&nbsp; Then Fritz could train and teach in his own way,

<P>and Father will help him.&nbsp; I can feed and nurse and pet and scold

<P>them, and Mother will be my stand-by.&nbsp; I've always longed for lots

<P>of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and

<P>revel in the little dears to my heart's content.&nbsp; Think what luxury--

<P>Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family

<P>went off into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till

<P>they thought he'd have an apoplectic fit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't see anything funny," she said gravely, when she

<P>could be heard.&nbsp; "Nothing could be more natural and proper than

<P>for my Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside

<P>in my own estate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is putting on airs already," said Laurie, who regarded

<P>the idea in the light of a capital joke.&nbsp; "But may I inquire how

<P>you intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are

<P>little ragamuffins, I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in

<P>a worldly sense, Mr. Bhaer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy.&nbsp; Of course I shall have

<P>rich pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether.&nbsp; Then,

<P>when I've got a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just

<P>for a relish.&nbsp; Rich people's children often need care and comfort,

<P>as well as poor.&nbsp; I've seen unfortunate little creatures left to

<P>servants, or backward ones pushed forward, when it's real cruelty.

<P>Some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect, and some lose

<P>their mothers.&nbsp; Besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy

<P>age, and that's the very time they need most patience and kindness.

<P>People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them

<P>out of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty

<P>children into fine young men.&nbsp; They don't complain much--

<P>plucky little souls--but they feel it.&nbsp; I've been through some-

<P>thing of it, and I know all about it.&nbsp; I've a special interest

<P>in such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm,

<P>honest, well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms

<P>and legs and the topsy-turvy heads.&nbsp; I've had experience, too,

<P>for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll testify that you tried to do it," said Laurie with a grateful
look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a

<P>steady, sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your

<P>money, and laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars.

<P>But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful

<P>things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you

<P>always did in the old times.&nbsp; I am proud of you, Teddy, for you

<P>get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't

<P>let them say so.&nbsp; Yes, and when I have my flock, I'll just point

<P>to you, and say `There's your model, my lads'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he

<P>was, something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst

<P>of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I say, Jo, that's rather too much," he began, just in his

<P>old boyish way.&nbsp; "You have all done more for me than I can ever

<P>thank you for, except by doing my best not to disapoint you.&nbsp; You

<P>have rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help,

<P>nevertheless.&nbsp; So, if I've got on at all, you may thank these two

<P>for it."&nbsp; And he laid one hand gently on his grandfather's head,

<P>and the other on Amy's golden one, for the three were never far

<P>apart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in

<P>all the world!" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted

<P>frame of mind just then.&nbsp; "When I have one of my own, I hope it

<P>will be as happy as the three I know and love the best.&nbsp; If John

<P>and my Fritz were only here, it would be quite a little heaven

<P>on earth," she added more quietly.&nbsp; And that night when she went

<P>to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels, hopes,

<P>and plans, her heart was so full of happiness that she could only

<P>calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own, and

<P>thinking tender thoughts of Beth.

<P>It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed

<P>to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.&nbsp; Almost

<P>before she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled

<P>at Plumfield.&nbsp; Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up

<P>like mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as

<P>rich, for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case

<P>of destitution, and begging the Bhaers to take pity on the child,

<P>and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support.&nbsp; In this way,

<P>the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and furnished her with

<P>the style of boy in which she most delighted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer

<P>mistakes, but the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer

<P>waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end.

<P>How Jo did enjoy her `wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear

<P>Aunt March would have lamented had she been there to see the

<P>sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with

<P>Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!&nbsp; There was a sort of poetic justice

<P>about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror of the boys

<P>for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden

<P>plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,

<P>and played cricket in the big field where the irritable

<P>`cow with a crumpled horn' used to invite rash youths to come and

<P>be tossed.&nbsp; It became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested

<P>that it should be called the `Bhaer-garten', as a compliment

<P>to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not

<P>lay up a fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--

<P>`a happy, homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and

<P>kindness'.&nbsp; Every room in the big house was soon full.&nbsp; Every

<P>little plot in the garden soon had its owner.&nbsp; A regular menagerie

<P>appeared in barn and shed, for pet animals were allowed.

<P>And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of

<P>a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces,

<P>which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding words,

<P>and grateful hearts, full of love for `Mother Bhaer'.&nbsp; She had

<P>boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not

<P>angels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and

<P>Professorin much trouble and anxiety.&nbsp; But her faith in the good

<P>spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most

<P>tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in

<P>time success, for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father

<P>Bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer

<P>forgiving him seventy times seven.&nbsp; Very precious to Jo was the

<P>friendship of the lads, their penitent sniffs and whispers after

<P>wrongdoing, their droll or touching little confidences, their

<P>pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even their misfortunes,

<P>for they only endeared them to her all the more.&nbsp; There were slow

<P>boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys, boys that

<P>lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a

<P>merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but

<P>who was welcome to the `Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted

<P>that his admission would ruin the school.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work,

<P>much anxiety, and a perpetual racket.&nbsp; She enjoyed it heartily
and

<P>found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of

<P>the world, for now she told no stories except to her flock of

<P>enthusiastic believers and admirers.&nbsp; As the years went on, two

<P>little lads of her own came to increase her happiness--Rob,

<P>named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed

<P>to have inherited his papa's sunshiny temper as well as his

<P>mother's lively spirit.&nbsp; How they ever grew up alive in that

<P>whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts, but

<P>they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough

<P>nurses loved and served them well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of

<P>the most delightful was the yearly apple-picking.&nbsp; For then the

<P>Marches, Laurences, Brookes.&nbsp; And Bhaers turned out in full force

<P>and made a day of it.&nbsp; Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these

<P>fruitful festivals occurred, a mellow October day, when the air

<P>was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise

<P>and the blood dance healthily in the veins.&nbsp; The old orchard wore

<P>its holiday attire.&nbsp; Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls.

<P>Grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped

<P>like fairy pipers at a feast.&nbsp; Squirrels were busy with their

<P>small harvesting.&nbsp; Birds twittered their adieux from the alders

<P>in the lane, and every tree stood ready to send down its shower

<P>of red or yellow apples at the first shake.&nbsp; Everybody was there.

<P>Everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down.&nbsp; Everybody

<P>declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such

<P>a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave themselves up to

<P>the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no

<P>such things as care or sorrow in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley,

<P>and Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The gentle apple's winey juice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout

<P>Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys,

<P>who made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed

<P>wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling.&nbsp; Laurie devoted

<P>himself to the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket,

<P>took Daisy up among the bird's nests, and kept adventurous

<P>Rob from breaking his neck.&nbsp; Mrs. March and Meg sat among

<P>the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting the contributions

<P>that kept pouring in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression

<P>in her face sketched the various groups, and watched over one

<P>pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her

<P>gown pinned up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her

<P>baby tucked under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which

<P>might turn up.&nbsp; Little Teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing

<P>ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was

<P>whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of

<P>another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa,

<P>who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest

<P>anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own

<P>small shoes.&nbsp; She knew that little Ted would turn up again in

<P>time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received

<P>him back with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained

<P>empty, while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and

<P>bruises.&nbsp; Then Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys,

<P>set forth the supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was

<P>always the crowning joy of the day.&nbsp; The land literally flowed

<P>with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads were not

<P>required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment

<P>as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish

<P>soul.&nbsp; They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the

<P>fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking

<P>mild while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to

<P>leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were

<P>sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers roosted in

<P>the trees like a new style of bird.&nbsp; The little girls had a

<P>private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at his own

<P>sweet will.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the

<P>first regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--"Aunt

<P>March, God bless her!"&nbsp; A toast heartily given by the good man,

<P>who never forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the

<P>boys, who had been taught to keep her memory green.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday!&nbsp; Long life to her, with

<P>three times three!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and

<P>the cheering once begun, it was hard to stop it.&nbsp; Everybody's

<P>health was proposed, form Mr. Laurence, who was considered their

<P>special patron, to the astonished guinea pig, who had strayed

<P>from its proper sphere in search of its young master.&nbsp; Demi, as

<P>the oldest grandchild, then presented the queen of the day with

<P>various gifts, so numerous that they were transported to the

<P>festive scene in a wheelbarrow.&nbsp; Funny presents, some of them,

<P>but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments

<P>to Grandma's--for the children's gifts were all their own.&nbsp; Every

<P>stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs

<P>she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.&nbsp; Demi's

<P>miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut, Rob's

<P>footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was

<P>soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was

<P>so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--

<P>"To dear Grandma, from her little Beth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared,

<P>and when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken

<P>down, while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor

<P>suddenly began to sing.&nbsp; Then, from above him, voice after voice

<P>took up the words, and from tree to tree echoed the music of the

<P>unseen choir, as the boys sang with all their hearts the little

<P>song that Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and the Professor

<P>trained his lads to give with the best effect.&nbsp; This was something

<P>altogether new, and it proved a grand success, for Mrs. March

<P>couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands

<P>with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and

<P>Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs.

<P>March and her daughters under the festival tree.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't think I ever ought to call myself `unlucky Jo' again,

<P>when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified," said Mrs.

<P>Bhaer, taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which

<P>he was rapturously churning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured

<P>so long ago.&nbsp; Do you remember our castles in the air?" asked Amy,

<P>smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear fellows!&nbsp; It does my heart good to see them forget business

<P>and frolic for a day," answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal

<P>way of all mankind.&nbsp; "Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then

<P>seems selfish, lonely, and cold to me now.&nbsp; I haven't given up
the

<P>hope that I may write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm

<P>sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations

<P>as these."&nbsp; And Jo pointed from the lively lads in the

<P>distance to her father, leaning on the Professor's arm, as they

<P>walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations

<P>which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned

<P>among her daughters, with their children in her lap and at

<P>her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which

<P>never could grow old to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My castle was the most nearly realized of all.&nbsp; I asked for

<P>splendid things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be

<P>satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children

<P>like these.&nbsp; I've got them all, thank God, and am the

<P>happiest woman in the world."&nbsp; And Meg laid her hand on her tall

<P>boy's head, with a face full of tender and devout content.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would

<P>not alter it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic

<P>hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of

<P>beauty.&nbsp; I've begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says
it

<P>is the best thing I've ever done.&nbsp; I think so, myself, and mean

<P>to do it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep

<P>the image of my little angel."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the

<P>sleeping child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was

<P>a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow

<P>over Amy's sunshine.&nbsp; This cross was doing much for both father

<P>and mother, for one love and sorrow bound them closely together.

<P>Amy's nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.&nbsp; Laurie

<P>was growing more serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning

<P>that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep

<P>care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for ...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Into each life some rain must fall,

<P>Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.&nbsp; Don't

<P>despond, but hope and keep happy," said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted

<P>Daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against

<P>her little cousin's pale one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee,

<P>and Laurie to take more than half of every burden," replied Amy

<P>warmly.&nbsp; "He never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and

<P>patient with me, so devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort

<P>to me always that I can't love him enough.&nbsp; So, in spite of my

<P>one cross, I can say with Meg, `Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see

<P>that I'm far happier than I deserve," added Jo, glancing from

<P>her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass

<P>beside her.&nbsp; "Fritz is getting gray and stout.&nbsp; I'm growing
as

<P>thin as a shadow, and am thirty.&nbsp; We never shall be rich, and

<P>Plumfield may burn up any night, for that incorrigible Tommy

<P>Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under the bed-clothes,

<P>though he's set himself afire three times already.&nbsp; But in

<P>spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain

<P>of, and never was so jolly in my life.&nbsp; Excuse the remark, but

<P>living among boys, I can't help using their expressions now

<P>and then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one," began

<P>Mrs. March, frightening away a big black cricket that was

<P>staring Teddy out of countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not half so good as yours, Mother.&nbsp; Here it is, and we

<P>never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping

<P>you have done," cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which

<P>she never would outgrow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every

<P>year," said Amy softly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for

<P>it, Marmee dear," added Meg's tender voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out

<P>her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself,

<P>and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude,

<P>and humility...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can

<P>wish you a greater happiness than this!"
