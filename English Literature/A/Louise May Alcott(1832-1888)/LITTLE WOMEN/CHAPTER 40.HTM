<P>When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted

<P>the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one

<P>another by the increased affection which comes to bind households

<P>tenderly together in times of trouble.&nbsp; They put away their grief,

<P>and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth,

<P>and in it was gathered everything that she most loved, flowers,

<P>pictures, her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved

<P>pussies.&nbsp; Father's best books found their way there, Mother's

<P>easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest sketches, and every day

<P>Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine

<P>for Aunty Beth.&nbsp; John quietly set apart a little sum, that he

<P>might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with

<P>the fruit she loved and longed for.&nbsp; Old Hannah never wearied

<P>of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite,

<P>dropping tears as she worked, and from across the sea came

<P>little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring breaths

<P>of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat

<P>Beth, tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the

<P>sweet, unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave

<P>life, she tried to make it happier for those who should remain

<P>behind.&nbsp; The feeble fingers were never idle, and one of her

<P>pleasures was to make little things for the school children

<P>daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens from her

<P>window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small

<P>mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through

<P>forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and

<P>all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of

<P>the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers, as

<P>it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy

<P>godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously

<P>suited to their tastes and needs.&nbsp; If Beth had wanted any

<P>reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up

<P>to her window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters

<P>which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often

<P>used to look round, and say "How beautiful this is!" as they

<P>all sat together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing

<P>on the floor, mother and sisters working near, and father

<P>reading, in his pleasant voice, from the wise old books which

<P>seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as applicable now as

<P>when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a paternal

<P>priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying

<P>to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation

<P>possible.&nbsp; Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of

<P>those who listened, for the father's heart was in the minister's

<P>religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double

<P>eloquence to the words he spoke or read.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them

<P>as preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth

<P>said the needle was `so heavy', and put it down forever.&nbsp; Talking

<P>wearied her, faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own,

<P>and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills

<P>that vexed her feeble flesh.&nbsp; Ah me!&nbsp; Such heavy days, such
long,

<P>long nights, such aching hearts and imploring prayers, when those

<P>who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out

<P>to them beseechingly, to hear the bitter cry, "Help me, help me!"

<P>and to feel that there was no help.&nbsp; A sad eclipse of the serene

<P>soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with death, but both were

<P>mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion over, the old peace

<P>returned more beautiful than ever.&nbsp; With the wreck of her frail
body,

<P>Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little, those about her

<P>felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise

<P>the fittest, and waited with her on the shore, trying to see the

<P>Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said "I feel

<P>stronger when you are here."&nbsp; She slept on a couch in the room,

<P>waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the

<P>patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and `tried not to

<P>be a trouble'.&nbsp; All day she haunted the room, jealous of any other

<P>nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life

<P>ever brought her.&nbsp; Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her

<P>heart received the teaching that it needed.&nbsp; Lessons in patience

<P>were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them,

<P>charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly

<P>forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest

<P>easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn

<P>little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless

<P>night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears

<P>dropped through the transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching

<P>her with thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in

<P>her simple, unselfish way, was trying to wean herself from the

<P>dear old life, and fit herself for the life to come, by sacred

<P>words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music she loved so well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the

<P>saintliest hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could

<P>utter.&nbsp; For with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart

<P>softened by the tenderest sorrow, she recognized the beauty of

<P>her sister's life--uneventful, unambitious, yet full of the

<P>genuine virtues which `smell sweet, and blossom in the dust',

<P>the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered

<P>soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible to all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table,

<P>to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that

<P>was almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of

<P>her old favorite, Pilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper,

<P>scribbled over in Jo's hand.&nbsp; The name caught her eye and the

<P>blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen

<P>on it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Jo!&nbsp; She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask

<P>leave.&nbsp; She shows me all her things, and I don't think she'll

<P>mind if I look at this", thought Beth, with a glance at her

<P>sister, who lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready

<P>to wake up the minute the log fell apart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>MY BETH
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sitting patient in the shadow

<P>Till the blessed light shall come,

<P>A serene and saintly presence

<P>Sanctifies our troubled home.

<P>Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows

<P>Break like ripples on the strand

<P>Of the deep and solemn river

<P>Where her willing feet now stand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>O my sister, passing from me,

<P>Out of human care and strife,

<P>Leave me, as a gift, those virtues

<P>Which have beautified your life.

<P>Dear, bequeath me that great patience

<P>Which has power to sustain

<P>A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit

<P>In its prison-house of pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Give me, for I need it sorely,

<P>Of that courage, wise and sweet,

<P>Which has made the path of duty

<P>Green beneath your willing feet.

<P>Give me that unselfish nature,

<P>That with charity devine

<P>Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--

<P>Meek heart, forgive me mine!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus our parting daily loseth

<P>Something of its bitter pain,

<P>And while learning this hard lesson,

<P>My great loss becomes my gain.

<P>For the touch of grief will render

<P>My wild nature more serene,

<P>Give to life new aspirations,

<P>A new trust in the unseen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henceforth, safe across the river,

<P>I shall see forever more

<P>A beloved, household spirit

<P>Waiting for me on the shore.

<P>Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,

<P>Guardian angels shall become,

<P>And the sister gone before me

<P>By their hands shall lead me home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they

<P>brought a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one

<P>regret had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure

<P>her that her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring

<P>the despair she feared.&nbsp; As she sat with the paper folded between
her

<P>hands, the charred log fell asunder.&nbsp; Jo started up, revived the
blaze,

<P>and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not asleep, but so happy, dear.&nbsp; See, I found this and read it.

<P>I knew you wouldn't care.&nbsp; Have I been all that to you, Jo?" she

<P>asked, with wistful, humble earnestness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"OH, Beth, so much, so much!"&nbsp; And Jo's head went down upon the

<P>pillow beside her sister's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life.&nbsp; I'm not so good

<P>as you make me, but I have tried to do right.&nbsp; And now, when it's

<P>too late to begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know

<P>that someone loves me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"More than any one in the world, Beth.&nbsp; I used to think I

<P>couldn't let you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose

<P>you, that you'll be more to me than ever, and death can't part

<P>us, though it seems to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm

<P>sure I shall be your Beth still, to love and help you more than

<P>ever.&nbsp; You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father

<P>and Mother when I'm gone.&nbsp; They will turn to you, don't fail

<P>them, and if it's hard to work alone, remember that I don't

<P>forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing that than writing

<P>splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is the only thing

<P>that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the go easy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try, Beth."&nbsp; And then and there Jo renounced her old

<P>ambition, pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging

<P>the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of

<P>a belief in the immortality of love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the spring days came and went , the sky grew clearer, the

<P>earth greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds

<P>came back in time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but

<P>trustful child, clung to the hands that had led her all her life,

<P>as Father and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of

<P>the Shadow, and gave her up to God.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words,

<P>see visions, or depart with beatified countenances, and those

<P>who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end

<P>comes as naturally and simply as sleep.&nbsp; As Beth had hoped, the

<P>`tide went out easily', and in the dark hour before dawn, on

<P>the bosom where she had drawn her first breath, she quietly

<P>drew her last, with no farewell but one loving look, one little

<P>sigh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters

<P>made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again,

<P>seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced

<P>the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and

<P>feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a

<P>benignant angel, not a phantom full of dread.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When morning came, for the first time in many months the

<P>fire was out, Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still.

<P>But a bird sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops

<P>blossomed freshly at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed

<P>in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow,

<P>a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best

<P>smiled through their tears, and thanked God that Beth was well at last.
