<P>Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed

<P>upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and

<P>important.&nbsp; Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make

<P>inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was

<P>by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything

<P>if she did not ask.&nbsp; She was rather surprised, therefore,

<P>when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing

<P>air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air

<P>of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.&nbsp; This left

<P>Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse,

<P>and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long

<P>confinement.&nbsp; Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much

<P>as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for

<P>he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the

<P>secret from her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner

<P>suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led

<P>Jo a trying life of it.&nbsp; He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed,

<P>threatened, and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise

<P>the truth from her; declared her knew, then that he didn't care;

<P>and at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that

<P>it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.&nbsp; Feeling indignant that he was

<P>not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his wits to work

<P>to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was

<P>absorbed in preparations for her father's return, but all of a

<P>sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two,

<P>she was quite unlike herself.&nbsp; She started when spoken to,

<P>blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing,

<P>with a timid, troubled look on her face.&nbsp; To her mother's inquiries

<P>she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's she silenced by

<P>begging to be let alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very

<P>fast.&nbsp; She's got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross,

<P>doesn't eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners.&nbsp; I caught her

<P>singing that song he gave her, and once she said `John', as you

<P>do, and then turned as red as a poppy.&nbsp; whatever shall we do?"

<P>said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing but wait.&nbsp; Let her alone, be kind and patient, and

<P>Father's coming will settle everything," replied her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.&nbsp; How odd! Teddy

<P>never seals mine," said Jo next day, as she distributed the

<P>contents of the little post office.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a

<P>sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her

<P>note with a frightened face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My child, what is it?" cried her mother, running to her,

<P>while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's all a mistake, he didn't send it.&nbsp; Oh, Jo, how could

<P>you do it?" and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her

<P>heart were quite broken.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!&nbsp; I've done nothing!&nbsp; What's she talking about?" cried

<P>Jo, bewildered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled

<P>note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully,

<P>"You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you.&nbsp; How could you be

<P>so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the

<P>note, which was written in a peculiar hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My Dearest Margaret,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate

<P>before I return.&nbsp; I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think

<P>they would consent if they knew that we adored one another.&nbsp; Mr.

<P>Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet

<P>girl, you will make me happy.&nbsp; I implore you to say nothing to

<P>your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your devoted John."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, the little villain!&nbsp; That's the way he meant to pay me

<P>for keeping my word to Mother.&nbsp; I'll give him a hearty scolding

<P>and bring him over to beg pardon," cried Jo, burning to execute

<P>immediate justice.&nbsp; But her mother held her back, saying, with

<P>a look she seldom wore...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.&nbsp; You have played

<P>so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On my word, Mother, I haven't!&nbsp; I never saw that note

<P>before, and don't know anything about it, as true as I live!"

<P>said Jo, so earnestly that they believed her.&nbsp; "If I had taken

<P>part in it I'd have done it better than this, and have written

<P>a sensible note.&nbsp; I should think you'd have known Mr. Brooke

<P>wouldn't write such stuff as that," she added, scornfully

<P>tossing down the paper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's like his writing," faltered Meg, comparing it with the

<P>note in her hand.

<P>"Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?" cried Mrs. March quickly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I did!" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's a scrape!&nbsp; Do let me bring that wicked boy over to

<P>explain and be lectured.&nbsp; I can't rest till I get hold of him."

<P>And Jo made for the door again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hush!&nbsp; Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought.

<P>Margaret, tell me the whole story," commanded Mrs. March, sitting

<P>down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look

<P>as if he knew anything about it," began Meg, without looking up.

<P>"I was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered

<P>how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I

<P>kept my little secret for a few days.&nbsp; I'm so silly that I liked

<P>to think no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I

<P>felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do.&nbsp; Forgive

<P>me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now.&nbsp; I never can look him

<P>in the face again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What did you say to him?' asked Mrs. March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet,

<P>that I didn't wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak

<P>to father.&nbsp; I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be

<P>his friend, but nothing more, for a long while."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her

<P>hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, "You are almost equal to

<P>Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence!&nbsp; Tell on, Meg.

<P>What did he say to that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he

<P>never sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my

<P>roguish sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names.&nbsp; It's

<P>very kind and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair,

<P>and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.&nbsp; All of a

<P>sudden she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking

<P>at them closely, said decidedly, "I don't believe Brooke ever

<P>saw either of these letters.&nbsp; Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours

<P>to crow over me with because I wouldn't tell him my secret."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't have any secrets, Jo.&nbsp; Tell it to Mother and keep

<P>out of trouble, as I should have done," said Meg warningly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless you, child!&nbsp; Mother told me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That will do, Jo.&nbsp; I'll comfort Meg while you go and get

<P>Laurie.&nbsp; I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop

<P>to such pranks at once."

<P>Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's

<P>real feelings.&nbsp; "Now, dear, what are your own?&nbsp; Do you love
him

<P>enough to wait till her can make a home for you, or will you

<P>keep yourself quite free for the present?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have

<P>anything to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>answered Meg petulantly.&nbsp; "If John doesn't know anything about

<P>this nonsense, don't tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their

<P>tongues.&nbsp; I won't be deceived and plagued and made a fool of.

<P>It's a shame!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her

<P>pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her

<P>by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the

<P>future.&nbsp; The instant Laurie's step was heard in the hall, Meg

<P>fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone.

<P>Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn't come,

<P>but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and stood

<P>twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.

<P>Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like

<P>a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.&nbsp; The

<P>sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour,

<P>but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their

<P>mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the

<P>spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact.&nbsp; Meg received

<P>his humble apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that

<P>Brooke knew nothing of the joke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't

<P>drag it out of me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do

<P>anything to show how out-and-out sorry I am," he added,

<P>looking very much ashamed of himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I

<P>didn't think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie," replied

<P>Meg, trying to hid her maidenly confusion under a gravely

<P>reproachful air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be

<P>spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?" And

<P>Laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture,

<P>as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was

<P>impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in

<P>spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare

<P>that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and

<P>abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart

<P>against him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into

<P>an expression of entire disapprobation.&nbsp; Laurie looked at her

<P>once or twice, but as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt

<P>injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done

<P>with him, when he made her a low bow and walked off without a

<P>word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving,

<P>and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt

<P>lonely and longed for Teddy.&nbsp; After resisting for some time,

<P>she yielded to the impulse, and armed with a book to return,

<P>went over to the big house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is Mr. Laurence in?" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was

<P>coming downstairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why not?&nbsp; Is he ill?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is

<P>in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old

<P>gentleman, so I dursn't go nigh him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where is Laurie?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been

<P>a-tapping.&nbsp; I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's

<P>ready, and there's no one to eat it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll go and see what the matter is.&nbsp; I'm not afraid of either

<P>of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's

<P>little study.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!" called out

<P>the young gentleman in a threatening tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo immediately knocked again.&nbsp; The door flew open, and in

<P>she bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise.&nbsp; Seeing

<P>that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him,

<P>assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon

<P>her knees, said meekly, "Please forgive me for being so cross.&nbsp;
I

<P>came to make it up, and can't go away till I have."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's all right.&nbsp; Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo," was the

<P>cavalier reply to her petition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, I will.&nbsp; Could I ask what's the matter?&nbsp; You don't

<P>look exactly easy in your mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!" growled Laurie indignantly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who did it?" demanded Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Grandfather.&nbsp; If it had been anyone else I'd have..."

<P>And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic

<P>gesture of the right arm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's nothing.&nbsp; I often shake you, and you don't mind,"

<P>said Jo soothingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pooh!&nbsp; You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man

<P>to shake me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked

<P>as much like a thundercloud as you do now.&nbsp; Why were you treated

<P>so?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for.

<P>I'd promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break

<P>my word."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing

<P>but the truth.&nbsp; I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could

<P>without bringing Meg in.&nbsp; As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and

<P>bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me.&nbsp; Then I

<P>bolted, for fear I should forget myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and

<P>make up.&nbsp; I'll help you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hanged if I do!&nbsp; I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled

<P>by everyone, just for a bit of a frolic.&nbsp; I was sorry about Meg,

<P>and begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again,

<P>when I wasn't in the wrong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He didn't know that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby.&nbsp; It's

<P>no use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of

<P>myself, and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by."

<P>"What pepper pots you are! " sighed Jo.&nbsp; "How do you mean

<P>to settle this affair?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I

<P>can't tell him what the fuss's about."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless you!&nbsp; He won't do that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I won't go down till he does."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Teddy, be sensible.&nbsp; Let it pass, and I'll explain

<P>what I can.&nbsp; You can't stay here, so what's the use of being

<P>melodramatic?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't intend to stay here long, anyway.&nbsp; I'll slip off and

<P>take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come

<P>round fast enough."

<P>"I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't preach.&nbsp; I'll go to Washington and see Brooke.&nbsp; It's

<P>gay there, and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What fun you'd have!&nbsp; I wish I could run off too," said

<P>Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial

<P>life at the capital.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come on, then!&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; You go and surprise your father,

<P>and I'll stir up old Brooke.&nbsp; It would be a glorious joke.&nbsp;
Let's

<P>do it, Jo.&nbsp; We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot

<P>off at once.&nbsp; I've got money enough.&nbsp; It will do you good,
and no

<P>harm, as you go to your father."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as

<P>the plan was, it just suited her.&nbsp; She was tired of care and

<P>confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father

<P>blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals,

<P>liberty and fun.&nbsp; Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully

<P>toward the window, but they fell on the old house opposite,

<P>and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time,

<P>but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home.

<P>Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's the fun of it," began Laurie, who had got a willful

<P>fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hold your tongue!" cried Jo, covering her ears.&nbsp; "`Prunes

<P>and prisms' are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to

<P>it.&nbsp; I came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me

<P>skip to think of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I

<P>thought you had more spirit," began Laurie insinuatingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bad boy, be quiet!&nbsp; Sit down and think of your own sins,

<P>don't go making me add to mine.&nbsp; If I get your grandpa to

<P>apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?"

<P>asked Jo seriously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, but you won't do it," answered Laurie, who wished

<P>to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be

<P>appeased first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I can manage the young one, I can the old one," muttered Jo,

<P>as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map

<P>with his head propped up on both hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come in!"&nbsp; And Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer

<P>than ever, as Jo tapped at his door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's only me, Sir, come to return a book," she said blandly,

<P>as she entered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Want any more?" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and

<P>vexed, but trying not to show it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, please.&nbsp; I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the

<P>second volume," returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by

<P>accepting a second dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he had recommended

<P>that lively work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps

<P>toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed.&nbsp; Jo

<P>skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching

<P>for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the

<P>dangerous object of her visit.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect

<P>that something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several

<P>brisk turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so

<P>abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What has that boy been about?&nbsp; Don't try to shield him.&nbsp;
I

<P>know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came

<P>home.&nbsp; I can't get a word from him, and when I threatened to

<P>shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself

<P>into his room."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to

<P>say a word to anyone," began Jo reluctantly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That won't do.&nbsp; He shall not shelter himself behind a promise

<P>from you softhearted girls.&nbsp; If he's done anything amiss, he

<P>shall confess, beg pardon, and be punished.&nbsp; Out with it, Jo.

<P>I won't be kept in the dark."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo

<P>would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft

<P>on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she

<P>had to stay and brave it out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.&nbsp; Mother forbade it.&nbsp; Laurie has

<P>confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough.&nbsp; We don't

<P>keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make

<P>more trouble if you interfere.&nbsp; Please don't.&nbsp; It was partly
my

<P>fault, but it's all right now.&nbsp; So let's forget it, and talk about

<P>the RAMBLER or something pleasant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hang the RAMBLER!&nbsp; Come down and give me your word that

<P>this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or

<P>impertinent.&nbsp; If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll

<P>thrash him with my own hands."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew

<P>the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his

<P>grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary.&nbsp; She obediently

<P>descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without

<P>betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hum...&nbsp; ha...&nbsp; well, if the boy held his tongue

<P>because he promised, and not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him.

<P>He's a stubborn fellow and hard to manage," said Mr. Laurence,

<P>rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale,

<P>and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's

<P>horses and all the king's men couldn't," said Jo, trying to say

<P>a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape

<P>only to fall into another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?" was the sharp answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear no, Sir.&nbsp; You are rather too kind sometimes, and

<P>then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience.&nbsp; Don't you

<P>think you are?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look

<P>quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech.

<P>To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw

<P>his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly,

<P>"You're right, girl, I am!&nbsp; I love the boy, but he tries my

<P>patience past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll tell you, he'll run away." Jo was sorry for that speech the minute

<P>it was made.&nbsp; She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear
much restraint,

<P>and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down,

<P>with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which

<P>hung over his table.&nbsp; It was Laurie's father, who had run away

<P>in his youth, and married against the imperious old man's will.

<P>Jo fancied her remembered and regretted the past, and she wished

<P>she had held her tongue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only

<P>threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying.&nbsp; I often

<P>think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if

<P>you ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among

<P>the ships bound for India."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved,

<P>evidently taking the whole as a joke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?&nbsp; Where's your

<P>respect for me, and your proper bringing up?&nbsp; Bless the boys

<P>and girls!&nbsp; What torments they are, yet we can't do without

<P>them," he said, pinching her cheeks good-humoredly.&nbsp; "Go and

<P>bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's all right, and

<P>advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather.&nbsp; I

<P>won't bear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He won't come, Sir.&nbsp; He feels badly because you didn't believe
him

<P>when he said he couldn't tell.&nbsp; I think the shaking hurt his feelings

<P>very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr.

<P>Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking

<P>me, I suppose.&nbsp; What the dickens does the fellow expect?" And

<P>the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir.&nbsp; He says he

<P>won't come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and

<P>goes on in an absurd way.&nbsp; A formal apology will make him see

<P>how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp;
He

<P>likes fun, and this was is better than talking.&nbsp; I'll carry it

<P>up, and teach him his duty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles,

<P>saying slowly, "You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being

<P>managed by you and Beth.&nbsp; Here, give me a bit of paper,

<P>and let us have done with this nonsense."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would

<P>use to another after offering some deep insult.&nbsp; Jo dropped a kiss

<P>on the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the

<P>apology under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to

<P>be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities.

<P>Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work,

<P>and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down

<P>the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his

<P>most virtuous expression of countenance, "What a good fellow you

<P>are, Jo! Did you get blown up?" he added, laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, he was pretty mild, on the whole."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"AH!&nbsp; I got it all round.&nbsp; Even you cast me off over there,

<P>and I felt just ready to go to the deuce," he began apologetically.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again,

<P>Teddy, my son."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I

<P>used to spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there

<P>never will be an end," he said dolefully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it.&nbsp; Men

<P>always croak when they are hungry," and Jo whisked out at the

<P>front door after that.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's a `label' on my `sect'," answered Laurie, quoting

<P>Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his

<P>grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly

<P>respectful in manner all the rest of the day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud

<P>blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot

<P>it, Meg remembered.&nbsp; She never alluded to a certain person, but

<P>she thought of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever,

<P>and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk for stamps, found a

<P>bit of paper scribbled over with the words, `Mrs. John Brooke',

<P>whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling

<P>that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.
