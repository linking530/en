<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was

<P>wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified by a

<P>sweet example.&nbsp; But when the helpful voice was silent, the

<P>daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained

<P>but lonliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very

<P>hard to keep.&nbsp; How could she `comfort Father and Mother' when

<P>her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister,

<P>how could she `make the house cheerful' when all its light and

<P>warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the

<P>old home for the new, and where in all the world could she `find

<P>some useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the

<P>loving service which had been its own reward?&nbsp; She tried in a

<P>blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against

<P>it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should

<P>be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and

<P>harder as she toiled along.&nbsp; Some people seemed to get all sunshine,

<P>and some all shadow.&nbsp; It was not fair, for she tried more

<P>than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment,

<P>trouble and hard work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like

<P>despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life

<P>in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures,

<P>and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier.&nbsp; "I can't do
it.

<P>I wasn't meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break away

<P>and do something desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me,"

<P>she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell

<P>into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when

<P>strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize

<P>her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used

<P>the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity.&nbsp; Often she started

<P>up at night, thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the

<P>little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive

<P>sorrow, "Oh, Beth, come back!&nbsp; Come back!" she did not stretch
out

<P>her yearning arms in vain.&nbsp; For, as quick to hear her sobbing as

<P>she had been to hear her sister's faintest whisper, her mother came

<P>to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness

<P>that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater

<P>grief than Jo's, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers,

<P>because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow.

<P>Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the silence of the

<P>night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and

<P>strengthned love.&nbsp; Feeling this, Jo's burden seemed easier to bear,

<P>duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the

<P>safe shelter of her mother's arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise

<P>found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning

<P>over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile,

<P>she said very humbly, "Father, talk to me as you did to Beth.&nbsp;
I

<P>need it more than she did, for I'm all wrong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this," he answered,

<P>with a falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too,

<P>needed help, and did not fear to ask for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told

<P>her troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless

<P>efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look

<P>so dark, and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair.&nbsp; She

<P>gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and

<P>both found consolation in the act.&nbsp; For the time had come when
they

<P>could talk together not only as father and daughter, but as man and

<P>woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well

<P>as mutual love.&nbsp; Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study
which

<P>Jo called `the church of one member', and from which she came with

<P>fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit.

<P>For the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear,

<P>were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency

<P>or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude

<P>and power.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that

<P>would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly

<P>learned to see and value.&nbsp; Brooms and dishcloths never could

<P>be as distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided

<P>over both, and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to

<P>linger around the little mop and the old brush, never thrown

<P>away.&nbsp; As she used them, Jo found herself humming the songs

<P>Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and giving the

<P>little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and

<P>cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though

<P>she didn't know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze

<P>of the hand...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss

<P>that dear lamb ef you can help it.&nbsp; We don't say much, but we

<P>see it, and the Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved

<P>her sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew

<P>about good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy

<P>she was in husband and children, and how much they were all doing

<P>for each other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all.&nbsp; I wonder if I

<P>should blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?" said

<P>Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half

<P>of your nature, Jo.&nbsp; You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside,

<P>but silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at

<P>it.&nbsp; Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough

<P>burr will fall off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma`am, and it takes a good shake

<P>to bring them down.&nbsp; Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged

<P>by them," returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that

<P>blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old

<P>spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every

<P>argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially

<P>as two of Meg's most effective arguments were the babies,

<P>whom Jo loved tenderly.&nbsp; Grief is the best opener of some hearts,

<P>and Jo's was nearly ready for the bag.&nbsp; A little more sunshine
to

<P>ripen the nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a man's hand

<P>reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the kernal

<P>sound and sweet.&nbsp; If she suspected this, she would have shut up

<P>tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn't

<P>thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she dropped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she

<P>ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly,

<P>renounced the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified

<P>bonnet, with tracts in her pocket.&nbsp; But, you see, Jo wasn't a

<P>heroine, she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of

<P>others, and she just acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless,

<P>or energetic, as the mood suggested.&nbsp; It's highly virtuous

<P>to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once, and it takes

<P>a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together before some

<P>of us even get our feet set in the right way.&nbsp; Jo had got so far,

<P>she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did

<P>not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!&nbsp; She

<P>had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how

<P>hard, and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful

<P>than to devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home

<P>as happy to them as they had to her?&nbsp; And if difficulties were

<P>necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be

<P>harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own

<P>hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Providence had taken her at her word.&nbsp; Here was the task, not

<P>what she had expected, but better because self had no part in it.

<P>Now, could she do it?&nbsp; She decided that she would try, and in her

<P>first attempt she found the helps I have suggested.&nbsp; Still another

<P>was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort,

<P>as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor

<P>where he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why don't you write?&nbsp; That always used to make you happy,"

<P>said her mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my

<P>things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We do.&nbsp; Write something for us, and never mind the rest of

<P>the world.&nbsp; Try it, dear.&nbsp; I'm sure it would do you good,
and

<P>please us very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't believe I can."&nbsp; But Jo got out her desk and began to

<P>overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was,

<P>scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression,

<P>which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased

<P>with the success of her suggestion.&nbsp; Jo never knew how it

<P>happened, but something got into that story that went straight to

<P>the hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed

<P>and cried over it, her father sent it, much against her will, to

<P>one of the popular magazines, and to her utter surprise, it was

<P>not only paid for, but others requested.&nbsp; Letters from several

<P>persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the

<P>little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends,

<P>admired it.&nbsp; For a small thing it was a great success, and Jo was

<P>more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned

<P>all at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't understand it.&nbsp; What can there be in a simple little

<P>story like that to make people praise it so?" she said, quite bewildered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret.&nbsp; Humor and pathos

<P>make it alive, and you have found your style at last.&nbsp; You wrote

<P>with not thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it,

<P>my daughter.&nbsp; You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet.&nbsp;
Do

<P>your best, and grow as happy as we are in your success."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't

<P>mine.&nbsp; I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth," said Jo, more

<P>touched by her father's words than by any amount of praise from

<P>the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories,

<P>and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding

<P>it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were

<P>kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother,

<P>like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March

<P>feared that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but

<P>her fears were soon set at rest, for thought Jo looked grave at

<P>first, she took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans

<P>for `the children' before she read the letter twice.&nbsp; It was a

<P>sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike

<P>fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of,

<P>for no one had any objection to make.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You like it, Mother?" said Jo, as they laid down the closely

<P>written sheets and looked at one another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she

<P>had refused Fred.&nbsp; I felt sure then that something better than

<P>what you call the `mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a

<P>hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love

<P>and Laurie would win the day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent!&nbsp; You never said

<P>a worked to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when

<P>they have girls to manage.&nbsp; I was half afraid to put the idea

<P>into your head, lest you should write and congratulate them before

<P>the thing was settled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not the scatterbrain I was.&nbsp; You may trust me.&nbsp; I'm

<P>sober and sensible enough for anyone's confidante now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine,

<P>only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved

<P>someone else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and

<P>selfish, after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not

<P>best?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought

<P>that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like

<P>giving another answer.&nbsp; Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that

<P>you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your

<P>eyes that goes to my heart.&nbsp; So I fancied that your boy might fill

<P>the empty place if he tried now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, Mother, it is better as it ia, and I'm glad Amy has learned

<P>to love him.&nbsp; But you are right in one thing.&nbsp; I am lonely,
and perhaps

<P>if Teddy had tried again, I might have said `Yes', not because

<P>I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved than when

<P>he went away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on.

<P>There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father

<P>and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the

<P>best lover of all comes to give you your reward."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind

<P>whispering to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds.&nbsp; It's very

<P>curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of

<P>natural affections, the more I seem to want.&nbsp; I'd no idea hearts

<P>could take in so many.&nbsp; Mine is so elastic, it never seems full

<P>now, and I used to be quite contented with my family.&nbsp; I don't

<P>understand it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do."&nbsp; And Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned

<P>back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me.&nbsp; He isn't

<P>sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in

<P>all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that

<P>I don't seem to be the same girl I was.&nbsp; I never knew how good
and

<P>generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart,

<P>and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and

<P>am so proud to know it's mine.&nbsp; He says he feels as if he `could

<P>make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of

<P>love for ballast'.&nbsp; I pray he may, and try to be all he believes

<P>me, for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and

<P>might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be together.

<P>Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be,

<P>when two people love and live for one another!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy!&nbsp; Truly, love

<P>does work miracles.&nbsp; How very, very happy they must be!"&nbsp;
And Jo

<P>laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one

<P>might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader

<P>fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the workaday

<P>world again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she

<P>could not walk.&nbsp; A restless spirit possessed her, and the old

<P>feeling came again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully

<P>patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked, the other

<P>nothing.&nbsp; It was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away,

<P>but the natural craving for affection was strong, and Amy's happiness

<P>woke the hungry longing for someone to `love with heart

<P>and soul, and cling to while God let them be together'.

<P>Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended stood

<P>four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners

<P>name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood

<P>ended now for all.&nbsp; Jo glanced into them, and when she came to

<P>her own, leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the

<P>chaotic collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught

<P>her eye.&nbsp; She drew them out, turned them over, and relived that

<P>pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's.&nbsp; She had smiled at first,

<P>then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a

<P>little message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began

<P>to tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking

<P>at the friendly words, as they took a new meaning, and touched

<P>a tender spot in her heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wait for me, my friend.&nbsp; I may be a little late, but I shall

<P>surely come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, if he only would!&nbsp; So kine, so good, so patient with me

<P>always, my dear old Fritz.&nbsp; I didn't value him half enough when
I

<P>had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems

<P>going away from me, and I'm all alone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise

<P>yet to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag

<P>bag, and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the

<P>roof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits?&nbsp; Or was it

<P>the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently

<P>as its inspirer?&nbsp; Who shall say?
