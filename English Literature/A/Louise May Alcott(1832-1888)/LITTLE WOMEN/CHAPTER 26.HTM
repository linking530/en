<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It takes people a long time to learn the difference between

<P>talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women.

<P>Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for

<P>mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of

<P>art with youthful audacity.&nbsp; For a long time there was a lull in

<P>the `mud-pie' business, and she devoted herself to the finest

<P>pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that

<P>her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable.&nbsp; But

<P>over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold

<P>attempt at poker sketching.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear

<P>of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the

<P>house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with

<P>alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah

<P>never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at

<P>her door in case of fire.&nbsp; Raphael's face was found boldly executed

<P>on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on the head of a

<P>beer barrel.&nbsp; A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar
bucket,

<P>and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindling for some
time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers,

<P>and Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor.&nbsp; An artist friend

<P>fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and

<P>she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were

<P>never seen on land or sea.&nbsp; Her monstrosities in the way of cattle

<P>would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous

<P>pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most

<P>nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of

<P>shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the

<P>first glance.&nbsp; Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at
you

<P>from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo.&nbsp; Oily brown shadows

<P>of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt.

<P>Buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, Rubens, and Turner appeared in

<P>tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple

<P>clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be

<P>the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's robe, as the

<P>spectator pleased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a

<P>row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin.

<P>Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses

<P>were good, and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's

<P>eyes were pronounced `wonderfully fine'.&nbsp; A return to clay and

<P>plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted

<P>corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people's

<P>heads.&nbsp; Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent

<P>accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy to be regarded in

<P>the light of a young ogress.&nbsp; Her efforts in this line, however,

<P>were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which

<P>quenched her ardor.&nbsp; Other models failing her for a time, she

<P>undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day

<P>alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue,

<P>found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her

<P>foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with

<P>unexpected rapidity.&nbsp; With much difficulty and some danger she
was

<P>dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated

<P>that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting

<P>memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature

<P>set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies,

<P>and sighing for ruins to copy.&nbsp; She caught endless colds sitting
on

<P>damp grass to book `delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, one

<P>mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or `a heavenly mass of clouds',

<P>that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done.&nbsp; She

<P>sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun
to

<P>study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after

<P>`points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is
called.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If `genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy

<P>had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite

<P>of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing

<P>that in time she should do something worthy to be called `high art'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile,

<P>for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman,

<P>even if she never became a great artist.&nbsp; Here she succeeded better,

<P>for she was one of those happily created beings who please without

<P>effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and

<P>easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such

<P>are born under a lucky star.&nbsp; Everybody liked her, for among her

<P>good gifts was tact.&nbsp; She had an instinctive sense of what was

<P>pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person,

<P>did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed

<P>that her sisters used to say, "If Amy went to court without any

<P>rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in `our best society',

<P>without being quite sure what the best really was.&nbsp; Money, position,

<P>fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable

<P>things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who

<P>possessed them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring
what

<P>was not admirable.&nbsp; Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman,

<P>she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when

<P>the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from

<P>which poverty now excluded her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be

<P>a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money

<P>cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer

<P>nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of

<P>external drawbacks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma," Amy said, coming in

<P>with an important air one day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose

<P>eyes the stately young lady still remained `the baby'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls

<P>separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.&nbsp;
They

<P>are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some

<P>of the things they admire in my book.&nbsp; They have been very kind
to

<P>me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know

<P>I am poor, yet they never made any difference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why should they?" And Mrs. March put the question with what

<P>the girls called her `Maria Theresa air'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know as well as I that it does make a difference with

<P>nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when

<P>your chickens get pecked by smarter birds.&nbsp; The ugly duckling turned

<P>out a swan, you know."&nbsp; And Amy smiled without bitterness, for
she

<P>possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as

<P>she asked, "Well, my swan, what is your plan?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take

<P>them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,

<P>perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That looks feasible.&nbsp; What do you want for lunch?&nbsp; Cake,

<P>sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear, no!&nbsp; We must have cold tongue and chicken, French

<P>chocolate and ice cream, besides.&nbsp; The girls are used to such things,

<P>and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for

<P>my living."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning

<P>to look sober.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry

<P>them about."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing?&nbsp; Not more than

<P>six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and

<P>borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of

<P>charabanc.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All of this will be expensive, Amy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not very.&nbsp; I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such

<P>things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler

<P>plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and

<P>much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and

<P>attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all.

<P>I know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls

<P>will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay

<P>for it," said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to

<P>change into obstinacy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and

<P>when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons

<P>which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to

<P>taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your

<P>way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper,

<P>I'll say no more.&nbsp; Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way

<P>you decide, I'll do my best to help you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind."&nbsp; And away went Amy to

<P>lay her plan before her sisters.

<P>Meg agreed at once, and promised to her aid, gladly offering

<P>anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very

<P>best saltspoons.&nbsp; But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would

<P>have nothing to do with it at first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family,

<P>and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care
a

<P>sixpence for you?&nbsp; I thought you had too much pride and sense to

<P>truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and

<P>rides in a coupe," said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax

<P>of her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!"

<P>returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such

<P>questions arose.&nbsp; "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and
there's a

<P>great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of

<P>what you call fashionable nonsense.&nbsp; You don't care to make people

<P>like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your manners and

<P>tastes.&nbsp; I do, and I mean to make the most of every chance that
comes.

<P>You can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the

<P>air, and call it independence, if you like.&nbsp; That's not my way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually

<P>got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her

<P>side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities

<P>to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself

<P>worsted in an argument.&nbsp; Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence

<P>was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion

<P>took a more amiable turn.&nbsp; Much against her will, Jo at length

<P>consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister

<P>through what she regarded as `a nonsensical business'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following

<P>Monday was set apart for the grand event.&nbsp; Hannah was out of humor

<P>because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that "ef the

<P>washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well

<P>anywheres".&nbsp; This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery

<P>had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was `Nil

<P>desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded

<P>to do it in spite of all obstacles.&nbsp; To begin with, Hannah's cooking

<P>didn't turn out well.&nbsp; The chicken was tough, the tongue too salt,

<P>and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.&nbsp; Then the cake and ice
cost

<P>more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses,

<P>which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly

<P>afterward.&nbsp; Beth got a cold and took to her bed.&nbsp; Meg had
an unusual

<P>number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided

<P>state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were

<P>uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on

<P>Tuesday, and arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last

<P>degree.&nbsp; On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state

<P>which is more exasperating than a steady pour.&nbsp; It drizzled a little,

<P>shone a little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it

<P>was too late for anyone else to make up theirs.&nbsp; Amy was up at
dawn,

<P>hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that

<P>the house might be got in order.&nbsp; The parlor struck her as looking

<P>uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had not,

<P>she skillfully made the best of what she had, arranging chairs over

<P>the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls with

<P>homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to the room, as did the

<P>lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely

<P>hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and

<P>silver would get safely home again.&nbsp; The carriages were promised,
Meg

<P>and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help

<P>Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable

<P>as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of

<P>everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy

<P>cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch

<P>safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon

<P>of artistic delights, for the `cherry bounce' and the broken bridge

<P>were her strong points.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from

<P>parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.&nbsp;
A

<P>smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the

<P>young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two

<P>the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the

<P>perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so

<P>we must fly round and be ready for them," said Amy, as the sun woke

<P>her next morning.&nbsp; She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she
wished

<P>she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was

<P>getting a little stale.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad

<P>today," said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an

<P>expression of placid despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,"

<P>advised his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at
it.

<P>I'm very sorry, amy," added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said Amy decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the

<P>magnanimity of a martyr.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper,

<P>just to try me.&nbsp; I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was

<P>beginning to fail.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket,

<P>she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit

<P>and fit her for the labors of the day.&nbsp; After some delay, the object
of

<P>her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent

<P>further loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased
with

<P>her own forethought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old

<P>lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by

<P>trying to find out where all her money had gone to.&nbsp; So busy was
she

<P>with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a

<P>newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine

<P>voice said, "Good morning, Miss March," and, looking up, she beheld

<P>one of Laurie's most elegant college friends.&nbsp; Fervently hoping
that

<P>he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her

<P>feet, and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling

<P>dress, returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and

<P>spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at

<P>rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was

<P>chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out.

<P>In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the

<P>lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the

<P>highborn eyes of a Tudor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious

<P>youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and

<P>preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please don't--it's--it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly

<P>as red as her fish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, really, I beg pardon.&nbsp; It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't
it?"

<P>said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest

<P>that did credit to his breeding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the

<P>seat, and said, laughing, "Don't you wish you were to have some of the

<P>salad he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are

<P>to eat it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine

<P>mind were touched.&nbsp; The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo
of

<P>pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about `the charming young ladies'

<P>diverted his mind from the comical mishap.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't

<P>see them, that's a comfort," thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered

<P>that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the

<P>rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through

<P>with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and

<P>at twelve o'clock all was ready again.&nbsp; feeling that the neighbors

<P>were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of

<P>yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the

<P>`cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests

<P>to the banquet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's the rumble, they're coming!&nbsp; I'll go onto the porch and

<P>meet them.&nbsp; It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have
a

<P>good time after all her trouble," said Mrs. March, suiting the action

<P>to the word.&nbsp; But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable

<P>expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and

<P>one young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table.

<P>It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single

<P>girl," cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to

<P>stop even for a laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one

<P>guest who had kept her promise.&nbsp; The rest of the family, being
of

<P>a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott

<P>found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control

<P>entirely the merriment which possessed them.&nbsp; The remodeled lunch

<P>being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art

<P>discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant

<P>cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood

<P>till sunset, when `the party went out'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as

<P>ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had

<P>disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's

<P>mouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear," said

<P>her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself,

<P>I thought," observed Beth, with unusual warmth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Could you spare me some of your cake?&nbsp; I really need some, I

<P>have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,"

<P>asked Meg soberly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take it all.&nbsp; I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and

<P>it will mold before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking with

<P>a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they sat

<P>down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and

<P>the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,

<P>"salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn..."

<P>Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the `history of salads',

<P>to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.&nbsp; Germans

<P>like messes.&nbsp; I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason
you

<P>should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool," cried Amy, wiping

<P>her eyes.

<P>"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling

<P>about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big

<P>nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng," sighed

<P>Jo, quite spent with laughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our

<P>best to satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly

<P>regret.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am satisfied.&nbsp; I've done what I undertook, and it's not my

<P>fault that it failed.&nbsp; I comfort myself with that," said Amy with
a

<P>little quiver in her voice.&nbsp; "I thank you all very much for helping

<P>me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a

<P>month, at least."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No one did for several months, but the word `fete' always produced

<P>a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny

<P>coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.
