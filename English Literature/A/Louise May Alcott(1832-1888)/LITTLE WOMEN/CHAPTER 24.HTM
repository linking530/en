<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding

<P>with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip

<P>about the Marches.&nbsp; And here let me premise that if any of the

<P>elders think there is too much `lovering' in the story, as I fear

<P>they may (I'm not afraid the young folks will make that objection),

<P>I can only say with Mrs. March, "What can you expect when I have

<P>four gay girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the

<P>way?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The three years that have passed have brought but few changes

<P>to the quiet family.&nbsp; The war is over, and Mr. March safely at

<P>home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him

<P>a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in

<P>the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls

<P>all mankind `brother', the piety that blossoms into character,

<P>making it august and lovely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity

<P>which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to

<P>him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees,

<P>and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of

<P>hard experience had distilled no bitter drop.&nbsp; Earnest young men

<P>found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they, thoughtful

<P>or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure

<P>of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.&nbsp; Sinners
told

<P>their sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and

<P>saved.&nbsp; Gifted men found a companion in him.&nbsp; Ambitious men
caught

<P>glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own, and even worldlings

<P>confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although `they

<P>wouldn't pay'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house,

<P>and so they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among

<P>his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,

<P>anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always

<P>turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those

<P>sacred words, husband and father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their

<P>souls into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored

<P>so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth

<P>and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses

<P>life and outlives death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than

<P>when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that

<P>the hospitals and homes still full of wounded `boys' and soldiers'

<P>widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was

<P>sent home, and not allowed to return.&nbsp; He received no stars or
bars,

<P>but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life

<P>and love are very precious when both are in full bloom.&nbsp; Perfectly

<P>resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well,

<P>preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg.&nbsp; With the good

<P>sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused

<P>Mr. Laurence's more generous offers, and accepted the place of

<P>bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned

<P>salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing

<P>womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than

<P>ever, for love is a great beautifier.&nbsp; She had her girlish ambitions

<P>and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which

<P>the new life must begin.&nbsp; Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner,

<P>and Meg couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage,

<P>many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing

<P>she could have the same.&nbsp; But somehow envy and discontent soon

<P>vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had

<P>put into the little home awaiting her, and when they sat together in

<P>the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew

<P>so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie's splendor and felt

<P>herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such

<P>a fancy to AMy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons

<P>from one of the best teachers going, and for the sake of this

<P>advantage, Amy would have served a far harder mistress.&nbsp; So she
gave her

<P>mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely.

<P>Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained

<P>delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past.&nbsp; Not an

<P>invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had

<P>been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, and busy with the quiet

<P>duties she loved, everyone's friend, and an angel in the house, long

<P>before those who loved her most had learned to know it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As long as THE SPREAD EAGLE paid her a dollar a column for her

<P>`rubbish', as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and

<P>spun her little romances diligently.&nbsp; But great plans fermented
in

<P>her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the

<P>garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which

<P>was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather,

<P>was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner

<P>to please himself.&nbsp; A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners,

<P>much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into

<P>scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in

<P>great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like

<P>many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman

<P>against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in

<P>his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were

<P>her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that

<P>four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all

<P>their hearts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Being only `a glorious human boy', of course he frolicked and

<P>flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as

<P>college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and

<P>more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion.&nbsp;
But

<P>as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks,

<P>he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable

<P>atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed

<P>in perfection.&nbsp; In fact, he rather prided himself on his narrow

<P>escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his

<P>triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified professors, and vanquished

<P>enemies.&nbsp; The `men of my class', were heroes in the eyes of the
girls,

<P>who never wearied of the exploits of `our fellows', and were frequently

<P>allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie

<P>brought them home with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle

<P>among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift

<P>of fascination with which she was endowed.&nbsp; Meg was too much absorbed

<P>in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of

<P>creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder

<P>how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own

<P>element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the

<P>gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural

<P>to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies.&nbsp; They all
liked

<P>Jo immensely, but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped

<P>without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine.

<P>And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the `Dovecote'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared

<P>for Meg's first home.&nbsp; Laurie had christened it, saying it was

<P>highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who `went on together like a

<P>pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'.&nbsp; It was
a

<P>tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a

<P>pocket handkerchief in the front.&nbsp; Here Meg meant to have a fountain,

<P>shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present

<P>the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a

<P>dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,

<P>undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was

<P>merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.

<P>But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no

<P>fault from garret to cellar.&nbsp; To be sure, the hall was so narrow
it

<P>was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been

<P>got in whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a

<P>tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express

<P>purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the

<P>coalbin.&nbsp; But once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing

<P>could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided

<P>over the furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory.&nbsp; There

<P>were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the

<P>little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture

<P>or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all

<P>about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the

<P>fairer for the loving messages they brought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its

<P>beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any

<P>upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more

<P>gracefully than Amy's artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever

<P>better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes

<P>than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg's few boxes,

<P>barrels, and bundles, and I am morally certain that the spandy new

<P>kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not

<P>arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire

<P>all ready for lighting the minute `Mis.&nbsp; Brooke came home'.&nbsp;
I also

<P>doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of

<P>dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till

<P>the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds

<P>of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>People who hire all these things done for them never know

<P>what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving

<P>hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything

<P>in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on

<P>her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What happy times they had planning together, what solemn

<P>shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what

<P>shouts of laughter arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains.&nbsp; In

<P>his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through

<P>college, was a much of a boy as ever.&nbsp; His last whim had been to

<P>bring with him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious

<P>article for the young housekeeper.&nbsp; Now a bag of remarkable

<P>clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at
the

<P>first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a

<P>sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt,

<P>labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands, infallible

<P>cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the

<P>deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for

<P>odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its

<P>own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In vain Meg begged him to stop.&nbsp; John laughed at him, and Jo called

<P>him `Mr. Toodles'.&nbsp; He was possessed with a mania for patronizing

<P>Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth.

<P>So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different

<P>colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's

<P>setting the table for the first meal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you satisfied?&nbsp; Does it seem like home, and do you feel

<P>as if you should be happy here?" asked Mrs. March, as she and her

<P>daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then

<P>they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so

<P>happy that I can't talk about it," with a look that was far better

<P>than words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right," said Amy,

<P>coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether

<P>the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my

<P>mind to try her way first.&nbsp; There will be so little to do that
with

<P>Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only

<P>have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick," answered

<P>Meg tranquilly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sallie Moffat has four," began Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and

<P>missis would have to camp in the garden," broke in Jo, who, enveloped

<P>in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping

<P>with her fine establishment.&nbsp; Meg and John begin humbly, but I
have

<P>a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little

<P>house as in the big one.&nbsp; It's a great mistake for young girls
like

<P>Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and

<P>gossip.&nbsp; When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes

<P>to wear out or get torn, so that i might have the pleasure of mending

<P>them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my

<P>pocket handkerchief."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie

<P>says she does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and

<P>the servants laugh at her," said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did after a while, not to `mess' but to learn of Hannah how

<P>things should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.&nbsp;
It

<P>was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that

<P>I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food

<P>for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford

<P>to hire help.&nbsp; You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons

<P>you learn now will be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer

<P>man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should know how

<P>work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that," said Meg, listening respectfully

<P>to the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth

<P>upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping.&nbsp; "Do you know
I

<P>like this room most of all in my baby house," added Meg, a minute

<P>after, as they went upstairs and she looked into her well-stored

<P>linen closet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves

<P>and exulting over the goodly array.&nbsp; All three laughed as Meg spoke,

<P>for that linen closet was a joke.&nbsp; You see, having said that if
Meg

<P>married `that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt

<P>March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and

<P>made her repent her vow.&nbsp; She never broke her word, and was much

<P>exercised in her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a

<P>plan whereby she could satisfy herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Carrol, Florence's

<P>mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply

<P>of house and table linen, and send it as her present, all of which

<P>was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly

<P>enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly

<P>unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the

<P>old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.&nbsp; I had a

<P>young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had

<P>finger bowls for company and that satisfied her," said Mrs. March,

<P>patting the damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation

<P>of their fineness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will

<P>last me all my days, Hannah says."&nbsp; And Meg looked quite contented,

<P>as well she might.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a

<P>felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the

<P>road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to

<P>open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and

<P>a hearty .&nbsp; ..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here I am, Mother!&nbsp; Yes, it's all right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave

<P>him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so

<P>frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly

<P>kiss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and

<P>compliments.&nbsp; Bless you, Beth!&nbsp; What a refreshing spectacle
you

<P>are, Jo.&nbsp; Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a

<P>single lady."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg,

<P>pilled Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's bib pinafore, and fell

<P>into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all

<P>round, and everyone began to talk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where is John?" asked Meg anxiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which side won the last match, Teddy?" inquired Jo, who persisted

<P>in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ours, of course.&nbsp; Wish you'd been there to see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is the lovely Miss Randal?" asked Amy with a significant smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"More cruel than ever.&nbsp; Don't you see how I'm pining away?"

<P>And Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a

<P>melodramatic sigh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's the last joke?&nbsp; Undo the bundle and see, Meg," said

<P>Beth, eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire

<P>or thieves," observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared,

<P>amid the laughter of the girls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs.

<P>Meg, just swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse

<P>the neighborhood in a jiffy.&nbsp; Nice thing, isn't it?" And Laurie

<P>gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's gratitude for you!&nbsp; And speaking of gratitude reminds

<P>me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake

<P>from destruction.&nbsp; I saw it going into your house as I came by,
and

<P>if she hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it

<P>looked like a remarkably plummy one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie," said Meg in a

<P>matronly tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid,

<P>as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,"

<P>responded the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the

<P>little chandelier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this

<P>spick-and-span bower, so as I'm tremendously hungry,

<P>I propose an adjournment," he added presently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother and I are going to wait for John.&nbsp; There are some last

<P>things to settle," said Meg, bustling away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers

<P>for tomorrow," added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque

<P>curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow.&nbsp; I'm in such a state of exhaustion

<P>I can't get home without help.&nbsp; Don't take off your apron,

<P>whatever you do, it's peculiarly becoming," said Laurie, as Jo

<P>bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered

<P>her arm to support his feeble steps.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,"

<P>began Jo, as they strolled away together.&nbsp; "You must promise to

<P>behave well, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a prank."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never do.&nbsp; You are the one for that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony.&nbsp; I

<P>shall certainly laugh if you do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog

<P>round you will obscure the prospect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never cry unless for some great affliction."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such as fellows going to college, hey?" cut in Laurie, with

<P>suggestive laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be a peacock.&nbsp; I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls

<P>company."

<P>"Exactly.&nbsp; I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?&nbsp; Pretty amiable?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very.&nbsp; Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how

<P>he'll take it?" asked Jo rather sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say

<P>`All right', if it wasn't?" And Laurie stopped short, with an injured

<P>air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I don't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then don't go and be suspicious.&nbsp; I only want some money," said

<P>Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You spend a great deal, Teddy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is

<P>gone before I know it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow,

<P>and can't say `No' to anyone.&nbsp; We heard about Henshaw and all you
did

<P>for him.&nbsp; If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame

<P>you," said Jo warmly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.&nbsp; You wouldn't have me

<P>let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little

<P>help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen

<P>waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home.

<P>I thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it

<P>breaks out in a new spot.&nbsp; Just now it's the fashion to be hideous,

<P>to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,

<P>orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.&nbsp; If it was cheap

<P>ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I

<P>don't get any satisfaction out of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this

<P>attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which

<P>insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the

<P>advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the

<P>maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul!&nbsp; I have enough

<P>all through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home.

<P>I'll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a

<P>satisfaction to my friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow.

<P>I'm not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person

<P>who looks like a young prize fighter," observed Jo severely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,"

<P>returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having

<P>voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for

<P>quarterinch-long stubble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting

<P>desperate about Amy.&nbsp; He talks of her constantly, writes poetry,
and

<P>moons about in a most suspicious manner.&nbsp; He'd better nip his little

<P>passion in the bud, hadn't he?" added Laurie, in a confidential,

<P>elder brotherly tone, after a minute's silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course he had.&nbsp; We don't want any more marrying in this

<P>family for years to come.&nbsp; Mercy on us, what are the children

<P>thinking of?" And Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little

<P>Parker were not yet in their teens.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am.

<P>You are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left

<P>lamenting," said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the

<P>times.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be alarmed.&nbsp; I'm not one of the agreeable sort.&nbsp; Nobody

<P>will want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old

<P>maid in a family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You won't give anyone a chance," said Laurie, with a sidelong

<P>glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face.

<P>"You won't show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow

<P>gets a peep at it by accident and can't help showing that he likes

<P>it, you treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold

<P>water over him, and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't like that sort of thing.&nbsp; I'm too busy to be worried

<P>with nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so.

<P>Now don't say any more about it.&nbsp; Meg's wedding has turned all
our

<P>heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.&nbsp;
I

<P>don't wish to get cross, so let's change the subject."&nbsp; And Jo

<P>looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for

<P>them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted

<P>at the gate, "Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next."
