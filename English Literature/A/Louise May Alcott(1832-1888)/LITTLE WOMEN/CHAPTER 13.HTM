<P>Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock

<P>one warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were

<P>about, but too lazy to go and find out.&nbsp; He was in one of his

<P>moods, for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory,

<P>and he was wishing he could live it over again.&nbsp; The hot weather

<P>made him indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr.

<P>Brooke's patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by

<P>practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half

<P>out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs

<P>was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about

<P>some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into

<P>his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general,

<P>till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself.

<P>Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above

<P>him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining

<P>himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world,

<P>when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash.

<P>Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches

<P>coming out, as if bound on some expedition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What in the world are those girls about now?" thought

<P>Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there

<P>was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his

<P>neighbors.&nbsp; Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch

<P>slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff.&nbsp; Meg had a

<P>cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio.&nbsp; All

<P>walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate,

<P>and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, that's cool," said Laurie to himself, "to have a picnic

<P>and never ask me!&nbsp; They can't be going in the boat, for they

<P>haven't got the key.&nbsp; Perhaps they forgot it.&nbsp; I'll take it
to them,

<P>and see what's going on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time

<P>to find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last

<P>discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight

<P>when leaped the fence and ran after them.&nbsp; Taking the shortest
way

<P>to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came,

<P>and he went up the hill to take an observation.&nbsp; A grove of pines

<P>covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came

<P>a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp

<P>of the crickets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's a landscape!" thought Laurie, peeping through the

<P>bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat

<P>together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over

<P>them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot

<P>cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs

<P>as if these were no strangers but old friends.&nbsp; Meg sat upon her

<P>cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh

<P>and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green.&nbsp; Beth was

<P>sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for

<P>she made pretty things with them.&nbsp; Amy was sketching a group of

<P>ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.&nbsp; A shadow passed

<P>over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to

<P>go away because uninvited, yet lingering because home seemed very

<P>lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his

<P>restless spirit.&nbsp; He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with
it's

<P>harvesting, ran dawn a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly

<P>and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied

<P>the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring

<P>smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May I come in, please?&nbsp; Or shall I be a bother?" he asked,

<P>advancing slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and

<P>said at once, "Of course you may.&nbsp; We should have asked you before,

<P>only we thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll

<P>go away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've no objection, if you do something.&nbsp; It's against the

<P>rules to be idle here," replied Meg gravely but graciously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Much obliged.&nbsp; I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit,

<P>for it's as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.&nbsp; Shall I sew,

<P>read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears.

<P>I'm ready."&nbsp; And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression

<P>delightful to behold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Finish this story while I set my heel," said Jo, handing him

<P>the book.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes'm." was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to

<P>prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the `Busy Bee

<P>Society'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he

<P>ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive

<P>and charming institution is a new one?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Would you tell him?" asked Meg of her sisters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He'll laugh," said Amy warningly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who cares?" said Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I guess he'll like it," added Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course I shall!&nbsp; I give you my word I won't laugh.&nbsp; Tell

<P>away, Jo, and don't be afraid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The idea of being afraid of you!&nbsp; Well, you see we used to

<P>play Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in

<P>earnest, all winter and summer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I know," said Laurie, nodding wisely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who told you?" demanded Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Spirits."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I did.&nbsp; I wanted to amuse him one night when you were

<P>all away, and he was rather dismal.&nbsp; He did like it, so don't

<P>scold, Jo," said Beth meekly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can't keep a secret.&nbsp; Never mind, it saves trouble now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go on, please," said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her

<P>work, looking a trifle displeased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours?&nbsp; Well,

<P>we have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task

<P>and worked at it with a will.&nbsp; The vacation is nearly over, the

<P>stints are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I should think so," and Laurie thought regretfully of

<P>his own idle days.

<P>"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so

<P>we bring our work here and have nice times.&nbsp; For the fun of it
we

<P>bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to

<P>climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.&nbsp;
We

<P>call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away

<P>and see the country where we hope to live some time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an

<P>opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river,

<P>the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the

<P>great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky.&nbsp; The

<P>sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an

<P>autumn sunset.&nbsp; Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops,

<P>and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks

<P>that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How beautiful that is!" said Laurie softly, for he was quick

<P>to see and feel beauty of any kind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the

<P>same, but always splendid," replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the

<P>real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking.

<P>It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real,

<P>and we could ever go to it," said Beth musingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,

<P>by-and-by, when we are good enough," answered Meg with her sweetest
voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.&nbsp; I want to fly away

<P>at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,"

<P>said Jo.&nbsp; "I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb

<P>and wait, and maybe never get in after all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"you'll have me for company, if that's any comfort.&nbsp; I shall

<P>have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your

<P>Celestial City.&nbsp; If I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me,

<P>won't you, Beth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but

<P>she said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds,

<P>"If people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I

<P>think they will get in, for I don't believe there are any locks

<P>on that door or any guards at the gate.&nbsp; I always imagine it is

<P>as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their

<P>hands to welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we

<P>make could come true, and we could live in them?" said Jo, after

<P>a little pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which

<P>I'd have," said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the

<P>squirrel who had betrayed him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd have to take your favorite one.&nbsp; What is it?" asked

<P>Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, if the girls will too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We will.&nbsp; Now, Laurie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like

<P>to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.&nbsp;
I'm

<P>to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear

<P>me.&nbsp; And I'm never to be bothered about money or business, but
just

<P>enjoy myself and live for what I like.&nbsp; That's my favorite castle.

<P>What's yours, Meg?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and

<P>waved a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats,

<P>while she said slowly, "I should like a lovely house, full of all

<P>sorts of luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome

<P>furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of money.&nbsp; I am to be

<P>mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants,

<P>so I never need work a bit.&nbsp; How I should enjoy it!&nbsp; For I
wouldn't

<P>be idle, but do good, and make everyone love me dearly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?" asked

<P>Laurie slyly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I said `pleasant people', you know," And Meg carefully tied

<P>up her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband

<P>and some angelic little children?&nbsp; You know your castle wouldn't

<P>be perfect without," said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet,

<P>and rather scorned romance, except in books.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in

<P>yours," answered Meg petulantly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wouldn't I though?&nbsp; I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds,

<P>rooms piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand,

<P>so that my works should be as famous as Laurie's music.&nbsp; I want
to

<P>do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic

<P>or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead.&nbsp; I don't know

<P>what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all

<P>some day.&nbsp; I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous,

<P>that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and

<P>help take care of the family," said Beth contentedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you wish for anything else?" asked Laurie.

<P>"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; I

<P>only wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an

<P>artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best

<P>artist in the whole world," was Amy's modest desire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We're an ambitious set, aren't we?&nbsp; Every one of us, but

<P>Beth, wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect.

<P>I do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes," said Laurie,

<P>chewing grass like a meditative calf.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can

<P>unlock the door remains to be seen," observed Jo mysteriously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it.

<P>Hang college!" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's mine!" and Amy waved her pencil.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't got any," said Meg forlornly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you have," said Laurie at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In your face."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nonsense, that's of no use."

<P>"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,"

<P>replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little

<P>secret which he fancied he knew.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and

<P>looked across the river with the same expectant expression which

<P>Mr. Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how

<P>many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than

<P>now," said Jo, always ready with a plan.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless me!&nbsp; How old I shall be, twenty-seven!" exclaimed Meg,

<P>who felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and

<P>Amy twenty-two.&nbsp; What a venerable party!" said Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that

<P>time, but I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is

<P>sure you'll work splendidly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is she?&nbsp; By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!" cried

<P>Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy.&nbsp; "I ought to be satisfied
to

<P>please Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain,

<P>you see, and comes hard.&nbsp; He wants me to be an India merchant,
as he

<P>was, and I'd rather be shot.&nbsp; I hate tea and sild and spices, and

<P>every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon

<P>they go to the bottom when I own them.&nbsp; Going to college ought
to

<P>satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought to let me off

<P>from the business.&nbsp; But he's set, and I've got to do just as he
did,

<P>unless I break away and please myself, as my father did.&nbsp; If there

<P>was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat

<P>into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up

<P>very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's

<P>hatred of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the

<P>world for himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never

<P>come home again till you have tried your own way," said Jo, whose

<P>imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and

<P>whose sympathy was excited by what she called `Teddy's Wrongs'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's not right, Jo.&nbsp; You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie

<P>mustn't take your bad advice.&nbsp; You should do just what your

<P>grandfather wishes, my dear boy," said Meg in her most maternal tone.

<P>"Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him,

<P>I'm sure he won't be hard on you or unjust to you.&nbsp; As you say,
there

<P>is no one else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive

<P>yourself if you left him without his permission.&nbsp; Don't be dismal
or

<P>fret, but do your duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke

<P>has, by being respected and loved."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you know about him?" asked Laurie, grateful for the

<P>good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the

<P>conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good

<P>care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as

<P>tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her.&nbsp; And how

<P>he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never

<P>tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he

<P>can be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So he is, dear old fellow!" said Laurie heartily, as Meg

<P>paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story.&nbsp; "It's like

<P>Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and

<P>to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him.

<P>Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him,

<P>asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly

<P>way.&nbsp; He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for

<P>days and days, and went on about you all in flaming style.&nbsp; If
ever

<P>I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for Booke."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,"

<P>said Meg sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you know I do, Miss?"

<P>"I can always tell by his face when he goes away.&nbsp; If you

<P>have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.&nbsp; If you

<P>have plagued him, he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted

<P>to go back and do his work better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I like that?&nbsp; So you keep an account of my good and

<P>bad marks in Brooke's face, do you?&nbsp; I see him bow and smile as

<P>he passes your window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We haven't.&nbsp; Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said

<P>anything!&nbsp; It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and

<P>what is said here is said in confidence, you know," cried Meg,

<P>much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her

<P>careless speech.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't tell tales," replied Laurie, with his `high and mighty'

<P>air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore.

<P>"Only if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have

<P>fair weather for him to report."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please don't be offended.&nbsp; I didn't meant to preach or tell

<P>tales or be silly.&nbsp; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a

<P>feeling which you'd be sorry for by-and-by.&nbsp; You are so kind to

<P>us, we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think.

<P>Forgive me, I meant it kindly."&nbsp; And Meg offered her hand with
a

<P>gesture both affectionate and timid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind

<P>little hand, and said frankly, "I'm the one to be forgiven.&nbsp; I'm

<P>cross and have been out of sorts all day.&nbsp; I like to have you

<P>tell me my faults and be sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy

<P>sometimes.&nbsp; I thank you all the same."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as

<P>agreeable as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to

<P>please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her

<P>ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the `Busy Bee

<P>Society'.&nbsp; In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic

<P>habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled

<P>up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that

<P>little David, whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit,

<P>and watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand,

<P>thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much.

<P>Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to

<P>himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, "I'll

<P>let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he

<P>needs me, for I am all he has."
