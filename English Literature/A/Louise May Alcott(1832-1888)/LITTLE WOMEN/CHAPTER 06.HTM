<P>The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took

<P>some time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass

<P>the lions.&nbsp; Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he

<P>had called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls,

<P>and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much

<P>afraid of him, except timid Beth.&nbsp; The other lion was the fact
that

<P>they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting

<P>favors which they could not return.&nbsp; But, after a while, they found

<P>that he considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to

<P>show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome, their

<P>cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of

<P>theirs.&nbsp; So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses

<P>without stopping to think which was the greater.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the

<P>new friendship flourished like grass in spring.&nbsp; Every one liked

<P>Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were

<P>regularly splendid girls."&nbsp; With the delightful enthusiasm of youth,

<P>they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him,

<P>and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship

<P>of these simple-hearted girls.&nbsp; Never having known mother or sisters,

<P>he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and

<P>their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led.

<P>He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr.

<P>Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie

<P>was always playing truant and running over to the Marches'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,"

<P>said the old gentleman.&nbsp; "The good lady next door says he is studying

<P>too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.&nbsp; I suspect

<P>she is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been

<P>his grandmother.&nbsp; Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy.

<P>He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and

<P>Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What good times they had, to be sure.&nbsp; Such plays and tableaux,

<P>such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in

<P>the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the

<P>great house.&nbsp; Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked

<P>and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously,

<P>and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied

<P>pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie

<P>played `lord of the manor' in the most delightful style.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not

<P>pluck up courage to go to the `Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called

<P>it.&nbsp; She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being

<P>aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his

<P>heavy eyebrows, and said "Hey!" so loud, that he frightened her

<P>so much her `feet chattered on the floor', she never told her

<P>mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there

<P>any more, not even for the dear piano.&nbsp; No persuasions or

<P>enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to

<P>Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending

<P>matters.&nbsp; During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully

<P>led the conversation to music, and talked away about great

<P>singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told

<P>such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay

<P>in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if

<P>fascinated.&nbsp; At the back of his chair she stopped and stood

<P>listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red

<P>with excitement of this unusual performance.&nbsp; Taking no more

<P>notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on

<P>about Laurie's lessons and teachers.&nbsp; And presently, as if the

<P>idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for

<P>he was getting too fond of it.&nbsp; But the piano suffers for want

<P>of use.&nbsp; Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over, and

<P>practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know,

<P>ma`am?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly

<P>together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible

<P>temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid

<P>instrument quite took her breath away.&nbsp; Before Mrs. March could

<P>reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time.

<P>For I'm shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie

<P>is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing

<P>room after nine o'clock."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak,

<P>for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired.&nbsp; "Please,
tell

<P>the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why,

<P>never mind."&nbsp; Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked

<P>up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest

<P>yet timid way...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh sir, they do care, very very much!"

<P>"Are you the musical girl?" he asked, without any startling

<P>"Hey!" as he looked down at her very kindly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm Beth.&nbsp; I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite

<P>sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed," she added, fearing to

<P>be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a soul, my dear.&nbsp; The house is empty half the day, so

<P>come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to

<P>you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How kind you are, sir!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she

<P>was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because

<P>she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.

<P>The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,

<P>stooping down, he kissed herr, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.&nbsp; God bless you,

<P>my dear!&nbsp; Good day.&nbsp; madam."&nbsp; And away he went, in a
great hurry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to

<P>impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls

<P>were not home.&nbsp; How blithely she sang that evening, and how they

<P>all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing

<P>the piano on her face in her sleep.&nbsp; Next day, having seen both

<P>the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or

<P>three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way

<P>as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol

<P>stood.&nbsp; Quite by accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay

<P>on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to

<P>listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument,

<P>and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but

<P>the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like

<P>the voice of a beloved friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she

<P>had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general

<P>state of beatitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge

<P>nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful

<P>spirit that came and went unseen.&nbsp; She never knew that Mr. Laurence

<P>opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.&nbsp;
She

<P>never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away.

<P>She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she

<P>found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when

<P>he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he

<P>was to tell things that helped her so much.&nbsp; So she enjoyed herself

<P>heartily, and found, what isn't always the case, that her granted

<P>wish was all she had hoped.&nbsp; Perhaps it was because she was so
grateful

<P>for this blessing that a greater was given her.&nbsp; At any rate she

<P>deserved both.

<P>"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.&nbsp; He

<P>is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way.

<P>Can I do it?" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, dear.&nbsp; It will please him very much, and be a nice way of

<P>thanking him.&nbsp; The girls will help you about them, and I will pay
for

<P>the making up," replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in

<P>granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for

<P>herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was

<P>chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun.&nbsp; A cluster
of

<P>grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced

<P>very appropriate and pretty, and beth worked away early and late, with

<P>occasional lifts over hard parts.&nbsp; She was a nimble little needlewoman,

<P>and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.&nbsp; Then she
wrote

<P>a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto

<P>the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would

<P>happen.&nbsp; All day passed a a part of the next before any

<P>acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended

<P>her crochety friend.&nbsp; On the afternoon of the second day, she went
out

<P>to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily

<P>exercise.&nbsp; As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three,

<P>yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the

<P>moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful

<P>voices screamed...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's a letter from the old gentleman!&nbsp; Come quick, and read
it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Beth, he's sent you..." began Amy, gesticulating with

<P>unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by

<P>slamming down the window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.&nbsp; At the door her

<P>sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession,

<P>all pointing and all saying at once, "Look there!&nbsp; Look there!"&nbsp;
Beth

<P>did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood

<P>a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed

<P>like a sign board to "Miss Elizabeth March."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For me?" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she

<P>should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, all for you, my precious!&nbsp; Isn't it splendid of him?&nbsp;
Don't

<P>you think he's the dearest old man in the world?&nbsp; Here's the key
in

<P>the letter.&nbsp; We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he
says,"

<P>cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You read it!&nbsp; I can't, I feel so queer!&nbsp; Oh, it is too lovely!"

<P>and Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first worked she

<P>saw were...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss March:

<P>"Dear Madam--"

<P>"How nice it sounds!&nbsp; I wish someone would write to me so!" said

<P>Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had

<P>any that suited me so well as yours, '" continues Jo.&nbsp; "`Heartsease
is

<P>my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle

<P>giver.&nbsp; I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow `the old

<P>gentleman' to send you something which once belonged to the little

<P>grand daughter he lost.&nbsp; With hearty thanks and best wishes, I
remain

<P>"`Your grateful friend and humble servant,

<P>"`JAMES LAURENCE'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie

<P>told me how fond Mr.Laurence used to be of the child who died, and

<P>how he kept all her little things carefully.&nbsp; Just think, he's
given

<P>you her piano.&nbsp; That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,"

<P>said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited

<P>than she had ever been before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green

<P>sild, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty

<P>rack and stool, all complete," added Meg, opening the instrument

<P>and displaying its beauties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Your humble servant, James Laurence'.&nbsp; Only think of his

<P>writing that to you.&nbsp; I'll tell the girls.&nbsp; They'll think
it's

<P>splendid," said Amy, much impressed by the note.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try it, honey.&nbsp; Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,"

<P>said Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable

<P>piano ever heard.&nbsp; It had evidently been newly tuned and put in
apple-

<P>pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the

<P>happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly

<P>touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll have to go and thank him," said Jo, by way of a joke,

<P>for the idea of the child's really going never entered her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I mean to.&nbsp; I guess I'll go no, before I get frightened

<P>thinking about it." And, to the utter amazement of the assembled

<P>family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the

<P>hedge, and in at the Laurences' door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever

<P>see!&nbsp; The pianny has turned her head!&nbsp; She'd never have gone
in

<P>her right mind," cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls

<P>were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what

<P>Beth did afterward.&nbsp; If you will believe me, she went and knocked

<P>at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when

<P>a gruff voice called out, "come in!" she did go in, right up to

<P>Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand,

<P>saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, "I came to thank you,

<P>sir, for..." But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that

<P>she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the

<P>little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed

<P>him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old

<P>gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished.&nbsp; But he liked it.

<P>Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly!&nbsp; And was so touched and

<P>pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness

<P>vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his

<P>wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his

<P>own little grand daughter back again.&nbsp; Beth ceased to fear him

<P>from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if

<P>she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and

<P>gratitude can conquer pride.&nbsp; When she went home, he walked with

<P>her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat

<P>as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like

<P>a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig,

<P>by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the

<P>window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands,

<P>"Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end.
