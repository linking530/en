<P>Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking

<P>at the fire, and thinking.&nbsp; It was her favorite way of spending

<P>the hour of dusk.&nbsp; No one disturbed her, and she used to lie

<P>there on Beth's little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming

<P>dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed

<P>far away.&nbsp; Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow

<P>was her birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years

<P>went by, how old she was getting, and how little she seemed to

<P>have accomplished.&nbsp; Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for

<P>it.&nbsp; Jo was mistaken in that.&nbsp; There was a good deal to show,

<P>and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"An old maid, that's what I'm to be.&nbsp; A literary spinster,

<P>with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and

<P>twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor

<P>Johnson, I'm old and can't enjoy it, solitary, and can't share

<P>it, independent, and don't need it.&nbsp; Well, I needn't be a sour

<P>saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very

<P>comfortable when they get used to it, but..."&nbsp; And there Jo

<P>sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things

<P>to five-and-twenty.&nbsp; But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can

<P>get on quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall

<P>back upon.&nbsp; At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old

<P>maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be.&nbsp; At thirty

<P>they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if

<P>sensible, console themselves by remembering that they have twenty

<P>more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow

<P>old gracefully.&nbsp; Don't laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for

<P>often very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts

<P>that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices

<P>of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces

<P>beautiful in God's sight.&nbsp; Even the sad, sour sisters should

<P>be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest

<P>part of life, if for no other reason.&nbsp; And looking at them

<P>with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember

<P>that they too may miss the blossom time.&nbsp; That rosy cheeks

<P>don't last forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie

<P>brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as

<P>sweet as love and admiration now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids,

<P>no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry

<P>worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to

<P>the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of

<P>rank, age, or color.&nbsp; Just recollect the good aunts who have not

<P>only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without

<P>thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips

<P>they have given you from their small store, the stitches the

<P>patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old

<P>feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little

<P>attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.&nbsp; The

<P>bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you

<P>all the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that

<P>can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure

<P>to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt

<P>Priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart

<P>for `the best nevvy in the world'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during

<P>this little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to

<P>stand before her, a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her

<P>with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and

<P>didn't like to show it.&nbsp; But, like Jenny in the ballad...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not think it he,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped

<P>and kissed her.&nbsp; Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully
.&nbsp; ..
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh my Teddy!&nbsp; Oh my Teddy!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Glad!&nbsp; My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness.

<P>Where's Amy?"

<P>"Your mother has got her down at Meg's.&nbsp; We stopped there by

<P>the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your what?" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words

<P>with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, the dickens!&nbsp; Now I've done it."&nbsp; And he looked so

<P>guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You've gone and got married!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, please, but I never will again."&nbsp; And he went down

<P>upon his knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face

<P>full of mischief, mirth, and triumph.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Actually married?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very much so, thank you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy on us.&nbsp; What dreadful thing will you do next?" And

<P>Jo fell into her seat with a gasp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,"

<P>returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming

<P>with satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping

<P>in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get

<P>up, you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and

<P>promise not to barricade."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day,

<P>and patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone,

<P>"The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now.&nbsp; So, come

<P>and fess, Teddy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How good it sounds to hear you say `Teddy'! No one ever calls

<P>me that but you."&nbsp; And Laurie sat down with an air of great content.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What does Amy call you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My lord."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's like her.&nbsp; Well, you look it."&nbsp; And Jo's eye plainly

<P>betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless,

<P>a natural one, raised by time absence, and change of heart.&nbsp; Both

<P>felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible

<P>barrier cast a little shadow over them.&nbsp; It was gone directly

<P>however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?"

<P>"Not a bit, and you never will.&nbsp; You've grown bigger and

<P>bonnier, but you are the same scapegrace as ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,"

<P>began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled,

<P>is so irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!" answered Jo,

<P>smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another

<P>laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant

<P>old fashion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for

<P>they are all coming up presently.&nbsp; I couldn't wait.&nbsp; I wanted
to

<P>be the one to tell you the grand surprise, and have `first skim'

<P>as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at

<P>the wrong end.&nbsp; Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened.

<P>I'm pining to know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I did it to please Amy," began Laurie, with a twinkle

<P>that made Jo exclaim...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fib number one.&nbsp; Amy did it to please you.&nbsp; Go on, and tell

<P>the truth, if you can, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now she's beginning to marm it.&nbsp; Isn't it jolly to hear her?"

<P>said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it

<P>quite agreed.&nbsp; "It's all the same, you know, she and I being one.

<P>We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but

<P>they suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another

<P>winter in Paris.&nbsp; But Grandpa wanted to come home.&nbsp; He went
to please

<P>me, and I couldn't let him go along, neither could I leave Amy, and

<P>Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense,

<P>and wouldn't let Amy come with us.&nbsp; So I just settled the difficulty

<P>by saying, `Let's be married, and then we can do as we like'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course you did.&nbsp; You always have things to suit you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not always."&nbsp; And something in Laurie's voice made Jo say

<P>hastily...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we

<P>had heaps of good reasons on our side.&nbsp; There wasn't time to write

<P>and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by,

<P>and it was only `taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aren't we proud of those two word, and don't we like to say

<P>them?" interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching

<P>with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes

<P>that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.

<P>"A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I

<P>can't help being proud of her.&nbsp; Well, then Uncle and Aunt were

<P>there to play propriety.&nbsp; We were so absorbed in one another we

<P>were of no mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would

<P>make everything easy all round, so we did it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When, where, how?" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest

<P>and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very

<P>quiet wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget

<P>dear little Beth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently

<P>smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why didn't you let us know afterward?" asked Jo, in a

<P>quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We wanted to surprise you.&nbsp; We thought we were coming

<P>directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as

<P>we were married, found he couldn't be ready under a month, at

<P>least, and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked.

<P>Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went

<P>there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives.

<P>My faith!&nbsp; Wasn't it love among the roses!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of

<P>it, for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so

<P>naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten.

<P>She tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought

<P>that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast,

<P>and said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by

<P>forever.&nbsp; As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had

<P>been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love

<P>is altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is.

<P>Amy and you changed places in my heart, that's all.&nbsp; I think it

<P>was meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had

<P>waited, as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and

<P>so I got a heartache.&nbsp; I was a boy then, headstrong and violent,

<P>and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake.&nbsp; For it was one,

<P>Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself.

<P>Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I

<P>didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you

<P>both alike.&nbsp; But I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland,

<P>everything seemed to clear up all at once.&nbsp; You both got into

<P>your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the

<P>old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly

<P>share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly.

<P>Will you believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we

<P>first knew one another?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can

<P>be boy and girl again.&nbsp; The happy old times can't come back, and
we

<P>mustn't expect it.&nbsp; We are man and woman now, with sober work to
do,

<P>for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.&nbsp; I'm sure
you

<P>feel this.&nbsp; I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me.&nbsp;
I

<P>shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire

<P>him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would.&nbsp; We can't

<P>be little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and sister,

<P>to love and help one another all our lives, won't we, Laurie?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and

<P>laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the

<P>grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong

<P>friendship to bless them both.&nbsp; Presently Jo said cheerfully, for

<P>she didn't the coming home to be a sad one, "I can't make it true

<P>that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping.

<P>Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore,

<P>and pulling your hair when you teased.&nbsp; Mercy me, how time does
fly!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't

<P>talk so like a grandma.&nbsp; I flatter myself I'm a `gentleman growed'

<P>as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her

<P>rather a precocious infant," said Laurie, looking amused at her

<P>maternal air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much

<P>older in feeling, Teddy.&nbsp; Women always are, and this last year
has

<P>been such a hard one that I feel forty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Jo!&nbsp; We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring.

<P>You are older.&nbsp; Here's a line, and there's another.&nbsp; Unless
you smile,

<P>your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now,

<P>I found a tear on it.&nbsp; You've had a great deal to bear,

<P>and had to bear it all alone.&nbsp; What a selfish beast I've been!"

<P>And Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered,

<P>in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, "No, I had Father

<P>and Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the

<P>thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles

<P>here easier to bear.&nbsp; I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's

<P>good for me, and..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You never shall be again," broke in Laurie, putting his arm

<P>about her, as if to fence out every human ill.&nbsp; "Amy and I can't

<P>get on without you, so you must come and teach `the children' to

<P>keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do,

<P>and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly

<P>together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.&nbsp; I

<P>begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles

<P>seemed to fly away when you came.&nbsp; You always were a comfort, Teddy."

<P>And Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago,

<P>when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time,

<P>but Jo was smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had

<P>all vanished at his coming.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute,

<P>and laughing the next.&nbsp; You look a little wicked now.&nbsp; What
is it,

<P>Grandma?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Like angels!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, of course, but which rules?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let

<P>her think so, it pleases her, you know.&nbsp; By-and-by we shall take

<P>turns, for marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles

<P>one's duties."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the

<P>days of your life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall

<P>mind much.&nbsp; She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.&nbsp;
In

<P>fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly

<P>and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was

<P>doing you a favor all the while."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and

<P>enjoying it!" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with

<P>masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his "high

<P>and mighty" air, "Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the

<P>sort of man to submit to it.&nbsp; My wife and I respect ourselves and

<P>one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo like that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but

<P>the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled

<P>with her pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sure of that.&nbsp; Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to.

<P>She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed

<P>the man best, you remember."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She can blow him up as well as shine on him," laughed Laurie.

<P>"such a lecture as I got at Nice!&nbsp; I give you my word it was a
deal

<P>worse than any or your scoldings, a regular rouser.&nbsp; I'll tell
you

<P>all about it sometime, she never will, because after telling me that

<P>she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable

<P>party and married the good-for-nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What baseness!&nbsp; Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll

<P>defend you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I look as if I needed it, don't I?" said Laurie, getting up

<P>and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing

<P>to the rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, "Where is she?

<P>Where's my dear old Jo?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed

<P>all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers

<P>were set down to be looked at and exulted over.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence,
hale

<P>and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his

<P>foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the

<P>old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier

<P>than ever.&nbsp; It was good to see him beam at `my children', as he

<P>called the young pair.&nbsp; It was better still to see Amy pay him

<P>the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart,

<P>and best of all, to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never

<P>tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that

<P>her own dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Mofffat would be

<P>entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that `her ladyship' was

<P>altogether a most elegant and graceful woman.&nbsp; Jo thought, as she

<P>watched the pair, "How well they look together!&nbsp; I was right, and

<P>Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become

<P>his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to

<P>him."&nbsp; Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other

<P>with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done well,

<P>not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence,

<P>and happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens

<P>a peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,

<P>prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning.

<P>No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness

<P>of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace,

<P>for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true

<P>gentlewoman she had hoped to become.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Love has done much for our little girl," said her mother softly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,"

<P>Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray

<P>head beside him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her `pitty aunty',

<P>but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full

<P>of delightful charms.&nbsp; Demi paused to consider the new relationship

<P>before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which

<P>took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne.&nbsp;
A flank

<P>movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew

<P>where to have him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance

<P>you hit me in the face.&nbsp; Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,"

<P>and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small
nephew

<P>in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted

<P>his boyish soul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot?&nbsp; Ain't it a relishin'

<P>sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, anch a happy

<P>procession as filed away into the little dining room!&nbsp; Mr. March

<P>proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.&nbsp; Mrs. March as proudly leaned on

<P>the arm of `my son'.&nbsp; The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered,

<P>"You must be my girl now," and a glance at the empty corner by the

<P>fire, that made Jo whisper back, "I'll try to fill her place, sir.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at

<P>hand, for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were

<P>left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they

<P>made the most of the opportunity.&nbsp; Didn't they steal sips of tea,

<P>stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a

<P>crowning trespass, didn't they each whisk a captivating little tart

<P>into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously,

<P>teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail?

<P>Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts,

<P>and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of

<P>cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little sinners

<P>attached themselves to `Dranpa', who hadn't his spectacles on.&nbsp;
Amy,

<P>who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on

<P>Father Laurence's arm.&nbsp; The others paired off as before, and this

<P>arrangement left Jo companionless.&nbsp; She did not mind it at the

<P>minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them

<P>lovely silver dishes that's stored away over yander?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold

<P>plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day.&nbsp; Teddy thinks

<P>nothing too good for her," returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No more there is!&nbsp; Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?"

<P>asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't care."&nbsp; And Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an

<P>uncongenial topic just then.&nbsp; She stood a minute looking at the

<P>party vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the

<P>last stair, a sudden sense of lonliness came over her so strongly

<P>that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to

<P>lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her.&nbsp; If she had known what

<P>birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would

<P>not have said to herself, "I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed.

<P>It won't do to be dismal now."&nbsp; Then she drew her hand over her
eyes,

<P>for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her

<P>handkerchief was, and had just managed to call up a smile when

<P>there came a knock at the porch door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another

<P>ghost had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded

<P>gentleman, beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!" cried Jo, with a

<P>clutch, as if she feared the night would swallow him up before

<P>she could get him in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party," and the

<P>Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing

<P>feet came down to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, we haven't, only the family.&nbsp; My sister and friends

<P>have just come home, and we are all very happy.&nbsp; Come in, and

<P>make one of us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone

<P>decorously away, and come again another day, but how could he,

<P>when Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat?

<P>Perhaps her face had something to do with it, for she forgot

<P>to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness

<P>that proved irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far

<P>exceeded his boldest hopes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see

<P>them all.&nbsp; You haf been ill, my friend?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat,

<P>the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.&nbsp; We have had trouble

<P>since I saw you last."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, yes, I know.&nbsp; My heart was sore for you when I heard

<P>that," And he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face

<P>that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind

<P>eyes, the grasp of the big, warm hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer," she

<P>said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and

<P>pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened

<P>the door with a flourish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they

<P>were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received.

<P>Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very

<P>soon they liked him for his own.&nbsp; They could not help it, for

<P>he carried the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple

<P>people warmed to him at once, feeling even the more friendly

<P>because he was poor.&nbsp; For poverty enriches those who live above

<P>it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits.&nbsp; Mr.

<P>Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who

<P>knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself at

<P>home.&nbsp; The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and

<P>establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him

<P>by rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his

<P>watch, with juvenile audacity.&nbsp; The women telegraphed their

<P>approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got

<P>a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his guest's

<P>benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but

<P>said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to

<P>sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior

<P>would have amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but

<P>something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof

<P>at first, and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection.

<P>But it did not last long.&nbsp; He got interested in spite of himself,

<P>and before he knew it, was drawn into the circle.&nbsp; For Mr. Bhaer

<P>talked well in this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice.

<P>He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a

<P>shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own lost

<P>youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.&nbsp; Then his eyes

<P>would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered

<P>the mute inquiry if she had seen it.&nbsp; But Jo had her own eyes to

<P>take care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she

<P>prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting, like a

<P>model maiden aunt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of

<P>fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed

<P>her several propitious omens.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the

<P>absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in

<P>the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought,

<P>forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange

<P>men, to their great detriment.&nbsp; Then he seemed quite inspired,

<P>though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation

<P>had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.

<P>Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in

<P>an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father's

<P>absorbed face, "How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor

<P>to talk with every day!"&nbsp; Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed

<P>in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a gentleman

<P>than ever.&nbsp; His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but

<P>didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled

<P>it up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly

<P>erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine

<P>forehead a Jove-like aspect.&nbsp; Poor Jo, how she did glorify that

<P>plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting

<P>nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually

<P>had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear old fellow!&nbsp; He couldn't have got himself up with

<P>more care if he'd been going a-wooing," said Jo to herself, and

<P>then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully

<P>that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however,

<P>for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral

<P>pyre, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking,

<P>and made a dive after the little blue ball.&nbsp; Of course they

<P>bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came

<P>up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats,

<P>wishing they had not left them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully

<P>abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy

<P>poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest.&nbsp; The others sat

<P>round the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse

<P>of time, till Meg, whose maternal was impressed with a firm conviction

<P>that Daisy had tumbled out of be, and Demi set his nightgown

<P>afire studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all

<P>together again once more," said Jo, feeling that a good shout

<P>would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of

<P>her soul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were not all there.&nbsp; But no one found the words thougtless

<P>or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,

<P>invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break

<P>the household league that love made disoluble.&nbsp; The little

<P>chair stood in its old place.&nbsp; The tidy basket, with the bit of

<P>work she left unfinished when the needle grew `so heavy', was

<P>still on its accustomed shelf.&nbsp; The beloved instrument, seldom

<P>touched now had not been moved, and above it Beth's face, serene

<P>and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming

<P>to say, "Be happy.&nbsp; I am here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Play something, Amy.&nbsp; Let them hear how much you have improved,"

<P>said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded

<P>stool, "Not tonight, dear.&nbsp; I can't show off tonight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill,

<P>for she sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which

<P>the best master could not have taught, and touched the listener's

<P>hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have

<P>given her.&nbsp; The room was very still, when the clear voice failed

<P>suddenly at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn.&nbsp; It was hard

<P>to say...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling

<P>that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings

<P>that," said Jo, before the pause grew painful.&nbsp; And Mr. Bhaer

<P>cleared his throat with a gratified "Hem!" as he stepped into the

<P>corner where Jo stood, saying...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will sing with me?&nbsp; We go excellently well together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of

<P>music than a grasshopper.&nbsp; But she would have consented if he had

<P>proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless

<P>of time and tune.&nbsp; It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer

<P>sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided

<P>into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that

<P>seemed to sing for her alone.

<P>Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>used to be the Professor's favorite line, for `das land' meant

<P>Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth

<P>and melody, upon the words...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There, oh there, might I with thee,

<P>O, my beloved, go
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she

<P>longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart

<P>thither whenever he liked

<P>The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired

<P>covered with laurels.&nbsp; But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his

<P>manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she

<P>had been introduced simply as `my sister', and on one had called

<P>her by her new name since her came.&nbsp; He forgot himself still further

<P>when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.&nbsp; Please remember

<P>that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so

<P>suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him

<P>the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will

<P>gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will

<P>keep me here some days."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother's

<P>voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for

<P>Mrs. March was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs.

<P>Moffat supposed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suspect that is a wise man," remarked Mr. March, with

<P>placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had

<P>gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know he is a good one," added Mrs. March, with decided

<P>approval, as she wound up the clock.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you'd like him," was all Jo said, as she slipped

<P>away to her bed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to

<P>the city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some

<P>great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the

<P>fact.&nbsp; If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he

<P>looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a

<P>good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity,

<P>it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when

<P>he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.
