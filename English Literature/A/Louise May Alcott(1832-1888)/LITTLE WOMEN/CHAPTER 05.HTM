<P>"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo." asked

<P>Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through

<P>the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom

<P>in one hand and a shovel in the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Going out for exercise," answered Jo with a mischievous

<P>twinkle in her eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should think two long walks this morning would have

<P>been enough!&nbsp; It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to

<P>stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do," said Meg with a

<P>shiver.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never take advice!&nbsp; Can't keep still all day, and not

<P>being a pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire.&nbsp; I like

<P>adventures, and I'm going to find some."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg went back to toast her feet and read IVANHOE, and Jo

<P>began to dig paths with great energy.&nbsp; The snow was light, and

<P>with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for

<P>Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls

<P>needed air.&nbsp; Now, the garden separated the Marches' house from

<P>that of Mr. Laurence.&nbsp; Both stood in a suburb of the city, which

<P>was still countrylike, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and

<P>quiet streets.&nbsp; A low hedge parted the two estates.&nbsp; On one
side

<P>was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed

<P>of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers,

<P>which then surrounded it.&nbsp; On the other side was a stately stone

<P>mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from

<P>the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and

<P>the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children

<P>frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows,

<P>and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his

<P>grandson.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted

<P>palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.&nbsp; She

<P>had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the

<P>Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only

<P>knew how to begin.&nbsp; Since the party, she had been more eager than
ever,

<P>and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not

<P>been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she

<P>one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down

<P>into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That boy is suffering for society and fun," she said to herself.

<P>"His grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up

<P>all alone.&nbsp; He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody

<P>young and lively.&nbsp; I've a great mind to go over and tell the old

<P>gentleman so!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The idea amused Jo.&nbsp; who liked to do daring things and was

<P>always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.&nbsp; The plan of

<P>`going over' was not forgotten.&nbsp; And when the snowy afternoon came,

<P>Jo resolved to try what could be done.&nbsp; She saw Mr. Lawrence drive
off,

<P>and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she

<P>paused and took a survey.&nbsp; All quiet, curtains down at the lower
windows,

<P>servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly

<P>black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There he is," thought Jo, "Poor boy!&nbsp; All alone and sick this

<P>dismal day.&nbsp; It's a shame!&nbsp; I'll toss up a snowball and make
him look

<P>out, and then say a kind word to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once,

<P>showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big

<P>eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile.&nbsp; Jo nodded and laughed,

<P>and flourished her broom as she called out...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you do?&nbsp; Are you sick?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Better, thank you.&nbsp; I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a

<P>week."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm sorry.&nbsp; What do you amuse yourself with?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing.&nbsp; It's dull as tombs up here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you read?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not much.&nbsp; They won't let me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can't somebody read to you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and

<P>I hate to ask Brooke all the time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have someone come and see you then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There isn't anyone I'd like to see.&nbsp; Boys make such a row, and

<P>my head is weak."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?&nbsp; Girls

<P>are quiet and like to play nurse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't know any."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know us," began Jo, then laughed and stopped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I do!&nbsp; Will you come, please?" cried Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me.

<P>I'll go ask her.&nbsp; Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till
I

<P>come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,

<P>wondering what they would all say to her.&nbsp; Laurie was in a flutter

<P>of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get

<P>ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was `a little gentleman'.&nbsp; and
did

<P>honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a

<P>fresh color, and trying tidy up the room, which in spite of half a

<P>dozen servants, was anything but neat.&nbsp; Presently there came a
loud

<P>ring, than a decided voice, asking for `Mr. laurie', and a surprised-

<P>looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo, "said Laurie, going to the

<P>door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and

<P>quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three

<P>kittens in the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here I am, bag and baggage," she said briskly.&nbsp; "Mother sent her

<P>love, and was glad if I could do anything for you.&nbsp; Meg wanted
me to

<P>bring some of her blancmange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought

<P>her cats would be comforting.&nbsp; I knew you'd laugh at them, but
I couldn't

<P>refuse, she was so anxious to do something."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for

<P>in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew

<P>sociable at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That looks too pretty to eat," he said, smiling with pleasure,

<P>as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blancmange, surrounded by a

<P>garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show

<P>it.&nbsp; Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.&nbsp; It's so simple
you can

<P>eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore

<P>throat.&nbsp; What a cozy room this is!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It might be it it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and

<P>I don't know how to make them mind.&nbsp; It worries me though."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the

<P>hearth brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece,

<P>so--and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa

<P>turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.&nbsp; Now then,

<P>you're fixed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked

<P>things into place and given quite a different air to the room.&nbsp;
Laurie

<P>watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his

<P>sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How kind you are!&nbsp; Yes, that's what it wanted.&nbsp; Now please
take

<P>the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I came to amuse you.&nbsp; Shall I read aloud?" and Jo looked

<P>affectionately toward some inviting books near by.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you!&nbsp; I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd

<P>rather talk," answered Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a bit.&nbsp; I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going.

<P>Beth says I never know when to stop."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes

<P>goes out with a little basket?" asked Laurie with interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, that's Beth.&nbsp; She's my girl, and a regular good one she is,
too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, "Why, you see I often

<P>hear you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't

<P>help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such

<P>good times.&nbsp; I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes
you

<P>forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are.

<P>And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to

<P>see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother.&nbsp; Her

<P>face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers,

<P>I can't help watching it.&nbsp; I haven't got any mother, you know."

<P>And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips

<P>that he could not control.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's

<P>warm heart.&nbsp; she had been so simply taught that there was no

<P>nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank

<P>as any child.&nbsp; Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich
she

<P>was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him.

<P>Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as

<P>she said...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave

<P>to look as much as you like.&nbsp; I just wish, though, instead of peeping,

<P>you'd come over and see us.&nbsp; Mother is so splendid, she'd do you
heaps

<P>of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would

<P>dance.&nbsp; Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage

<P>properties, and we'd have jolly times.&nbsp; Wouldn't your grandpa let
you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think he would, if your mother asked him.&nbsp; He's very kind,

<P>though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much,

<P>only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers," began Laurie,

<P>brightening more and more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think

<P>you'd be a bother.&nbsp; We want to know you, and I've been trying to
do

<P>it this ever so long.&nbsp; We haven't been here a great while, you
know,

<P>but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much

<P>what happens outside.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here,
you

<P>know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home

<P>and get on as I can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's bad.&nbsp; You ought to make an effort and go visiting

<P>everywhere you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and

<P>pleasant places to go to.&nbsp; Never mind being bashful.&nbsp; It won't
last

<P>long if you keep going."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused

<P>of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was

<P>impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were

<P>meant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you like your school?" asked the boy, changing the subject,

<P>after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo

<P>looked about her, well pleased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean.&nbsp; I go to

<P>wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"

<P>answered Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering

<P>just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into

<P>people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at

<P>Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety

<P>old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the

<P>library where she reveled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the

<P>prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the

<P>middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his

<P>great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran

<P>down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was

<P>the matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; That does me no end of good.&nbsp; Tell on, please," he

<P>said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining

<P>with merriment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Much elated with her success, Jo did `tell on', all about

<P>their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and

<P>the most interesting events of the little world in which the

<P>sisters lived.&nbsp; Then they got to talking about books, and to

<P>Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she

<P>did, and had read even more than herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you like them so much, come down and see ours.&nbsp; Grandfather

<P>is out, so you needn't be afraid," said Laurie, getting up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not afraid of anything," returned Jo, with a toss of

<P>the head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't believe you are!" exclaimed the boy, looking at her

<P>with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have

<P>good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she

<P>met hem in some of his moods.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie

<P>led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever

<P>struck her fancy.&nbsp; And so, at last they came to the library,

<P>where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when

<P>especially delighted.&nbsp; It was lined with books, and there were

<P>pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of

<P>coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables,

<P>and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint

<P>tiles all round it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What richness!" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour

<P>chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction.

<P>"Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,"

<P>she added impressively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A fellow can't live on books," said Laurie, shaking his head

<P>as he perched on a table opposite.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming

<P>with alarm, "Mercy me!&nbsp; It's your grandpa!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, what if it is?&nbsp; You are not afraid of anything, you

<P>know," returned the boy, looking wicked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know

<P>why I should be.&nbsp; Marmee said I might come, and I don't think

<P>you're any the worse for it," said Jo, composing herself, though

<P>she kept her eyes on the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged.

<P>I'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me.&nbsp; It was so

<P>pleasant, I couldn't bear to stop," said Laurie gratefully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The doctor to see you, sir," and the maid beckoned as she

<P>spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Would you mind if I left you for a minute?&nbsp; I suppose I

<P>must see him," said Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't mind me.&nbsp; I'm happy as a cricket here," answered Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way.

<P>She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when

<P>the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, "I'm

<P>sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes,

<P>though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will

<P>of his own.&nbsp; He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like
him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, ma'am," said a gruff voice behind her, and there,

<P>to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her

<P>heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had

<P>said.&nbsp; For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but

<P>that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved

<P>to stay and get out of the scrape as she could.&nbsp; A second look
showed

<P>her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even

<P>than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which

<P>lessened her fear a good deal.&nbsp; The gruff voice was gruffer than
ever,

<P>as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, "So

<P>you're not afraid of me, hey?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not much, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I only said I thought so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you like me in spite of it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I do, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That answer pleased the old gentleman.&nbsp; He gave a short laugh,

<P>shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned

<P>up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod,

<P>"You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face.&nbsp;
He

<P>was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an

<P>honest one, and I was proud to be his friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, sir," And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for

<P>it suited her exactly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?" was the

<P>next question, sharply put.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only trying to be neighborly, sir."&nbsp; And Jo to how her visit

<P>came about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do

<P>him good perhaps.&nbsp; We are only girls, but we should be glad to

<P>help if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present

<P>you sent us," said Jo eagerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tut, tut, tut!&nbsp; That was the boy's affair.&nbsp; How is the poor

<P>woman?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Doing nicely, sir."&nbsp; And off went Jo, talking very fast, as

<P>she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested

<P>richer friends than they were.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just her father's way of doing good.&nbsp; I shall come and see

<P>your mother some fine day.&nbsp; Tell her so.&nbsp; There's the tea
bell,

<P>we have it early on the boy's account.&nbsp; Come down and go on being

<P>neighborly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you'd like to have me, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't."&nbsp; And Mr. Laurence offered

<P>her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What would Meg say to this?" thought Jo, as she was marched

<P>away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling

<P>the story at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hey!&nbsp; Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?" said the

<P>old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with

<P>a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with

<P>his redoubtable grandfather.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't know you'd come, sir," he began, as Jo gave him a

<P>triumphant little glance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs.&nbsp; Come to

<P>your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman."&nbsp; And having pulled

<P>the boy's hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while

<P>Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their

<P>backs, which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four

<P>cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted

<P>away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not

<P>escape him.&nbsp; There was color, light, and life in the boy's face

<P>now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's right, the lad is lonely.&nbsp; I'll see what these little

<P>girls can do for him," thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and

<P>listened.&nbsp; He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and

<P>she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had

<P>been one herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If the Laurences had been what Jo called `prim and poky',

<P>she would not have got on at all, for such people always made

<P>her shy and awkward.&nbsp; But finding them free and easy, she was

<P>so herself, and made a good impression.&nbsp; When they rose she

<P>proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show

<P>her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been

<P>lighted for her benefit.&nbsp; It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as

<P>she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on

<P>either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful

<P>vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the

<P>finest flowers till his hands were full.&nbsp; Then he tied them up,

<P>saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, "Please give these

<P>to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very

<P>much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great

<P>drawing room, by Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand

<P>piano, which stood open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you play?" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful

<P>expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sometimes," he answered modestly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please do now.&nbsp; I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Won't you first?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't know how.&nbsp; Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously

<P>buried in heliotrope and tea roses.&nbsp; Her respect and regard for

<P>the `Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well

<P>and didn't put on any airs.&nbsp; She wished Beth could hear him, but

<P>she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and

<P>his grandfather came to his rescue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That will do, that will do, young lady.&nbsp; too many sugarplums

<P>are not good for him.&nbsp; His music isn't bad, but I hope he will
do

<P>as well in more important things.&nbsp; Going?&nbsp; well, I'm much
obliged

<P>to you, and I hope you'll come again.&nbsp; My respects to your mother.

<P>Good night, Doctor Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not

<P>please him.&nbsp; When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she

<P>had said something amiss.&nbsp; He shook his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it was me.&nbsp; He doesn't like to hear me play."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll tell you some day.&nbsp; John is going home with you, as I

<P>can't."

<P>"No need of that.&nbsp; I am not a young lady, and it's only a

<P>step.&nbsp; Take care of yourself, won't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you promise to come and see us after you are well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good night, Laurie!"

<P>"Good night, Jo, good night!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family

<P>felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something

<P>very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge.

<P>Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had

<P>not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth

<P>sighed for the grand piano.&nbsp; and Amy was eager to see the fine

<P>pictures and statues.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"

<P>asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's

<P>father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the

<P>old man, who is very proud.&nbsp; The lady was good and lovely and

<P>accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after

<P>he married.&nbsp; They both died when Laurie was a little child, and

<P>then his grandfather took him home.&nbsp; I fancy the boy, who was born

<P>in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing

<P>him, which makes him so careful.&nbsp; Laurie comes naturally by his

<P>love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his

<P>grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.&nbsp; At any rate,

<P>his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he

<P>`glowered' as Jo said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me, how romantic!" exclaimed Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How silly!" said Jo.&nbsp; "Let him be a musician if he wants to,

<P>and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates

<P>to go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners,

<P>I suppose.&nbsp; Italians are always nice," said Meg, who was a little

<P>sentimental.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you know about his eyes and his manners?&nbsp; You never

<P>spoke to him, hardly," cried Jo, who was not sentimental.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows

<P>how to behave.&nbsp; That was a nice little speech about the medicine

<P>Mother sent him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He meant the blanc mange, I suppose."

<P>"How stupid you are, child!&nbsp; He meant you, of course."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did he?" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred

<P>to her before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never saw such a girl!&nbsp; You don't know a compliment when

<P>you get it," said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all

<P>about the matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to

<P>be silly and spoil my fun.&nbsp; Laurie's a nice boy and I like him,

<P>and I won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such

<P>rubbish.&nbsp; We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother,

<P>and he may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg

<P>will remember that children should be children as long as they can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,"

<P>observed Amy.&nbsp; "What do you say, Beth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was thinking about our `PILGRIM'S PROGRESS'," answered Beth,

<P>who had not heard a word.&nbsp; "How we got out of the Slough and through

<P>the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by

<P>trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things,

<P>is going to be our Palace Beautiful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have got to get by the lions first," said Jo, as if she

<P>rather liked the prospect.
