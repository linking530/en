<P>"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that

<P>those children should have the measles just now," said Meg, one

<P>April day, as she stood packing the `go abroady' trunk in her room,

<P>surrounded by her sisters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.&nbsp; A

<P>whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo,

<P>looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that," added Beth,

<P>tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for

<P>the great occasion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these

<P>nice things," said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she

<P>artistically replenished her sister's cushion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep

<P>my adventures to tell you when I come back.&nbsp; I'm sure it's the

<P>least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things

<P>and helping me get ready," said Meg, glancing round the room

<P>at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their

<P>eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?" asked

<P>Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar

<P>chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as

<P>gifts for her girls when the proper time came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a

<P>lovely blue sash.&nbsp; I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't

<P>time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlatan."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will

<P>set it off beautifully.&nbsp; I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet,

<P>for you might have had it," said Jo, who loved to give and lend,

<P>but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much

<P>use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure

<P>chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament

<P>for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want,"

<P>replied Meg.&nbsp; "Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking suit,

<P>just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for

<P>Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn't

<P>it?&nbsp; The violet silk would be so nice.&nbsp; Oh, dear!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never mind, you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and

<P>you always look like an angel in white," said Amy, brooding

<P>over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it

<P>will have to do.&nbsp; My blue housedress looks so well, turned and

<P>freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one.&nbsp; My silk

<P>sacque isn't a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like

<P>Sallie's.&nbsp; I didn't like to say anything, but I was sadly

<P>disappointed in my umbrella.&nbsp; I told Mother black with a white

<P>handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish

<P>handle.&nbsp; It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain, but
I

<P>know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a

<P>gold top," sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great

<P>disfavor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Change it," advised Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she

<P>took so much pains to get my things.&nbsp; It's a nonsensical notion

<P>of mine, and I'm not going to give up to it.&nbsp; My silk stockings

<P>and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort.&nbsp; You are a dear to

<P>lend me yours, Jo.&nbsp; I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with

<P>two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common."&nbsp; And

<P>Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.

<P>"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps.

<P>Would you put some on mine?" she asked, as Beth brought up a

<P>pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah's hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain

<P>gowns without any trimming on them.&nbsp; Poor folks shouldn't rig,"

<P>said Jo decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace

<P>on my clothes and bows on my caps?" said Meg impatiently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if

<P>you could only go to Annie Moffat's," observed Beth in her quiet

<P>way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I did!&nbsp; Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does

<P>seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it?&nbsp; There

<P>now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress,

<P>which I shall leave for Mother to pack," said Meg, cheering up, as

<P>she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed

<P>and mended white tarlatan, which she called her `ball dress' with

<P>an important air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight

<P>of novelty and pleasure.&nbsp; Mrs. March had consented to the

<P>visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back

<P>more discontented than she went.&nbsp; But she begged so hard, and

<P>Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure

<P>seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother

<P>yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable
life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather

<P>daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance

<P>of its occupants.&nbsp; But they were kindly people, in spite of the

<P>frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease.

<P>Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not

<P>particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their

<P>gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which

<P>they were made.&nbsp; It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously,

<P>drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do

<P>nothing but enjoy herself.&nbsp; It suited her exactly, and soon she

<P>began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her,

<P>to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her

<P>hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as

<P>she could.&nbsp; The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the

<P>more she envied her and sighed to be rich.&nbsp; Home now looked bare

<P>and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and

<P>she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in

<P>spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had not much time for repining, however, for the three

<P>young girls were busily employed in `having a good time'.&nbsp; They

<P>shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and

<P>operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many

<P>friends and knew how to entertain them.&nbsp; Her older sisters were

<P>very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely

<P>interesting and romantic, Meg thought.&nbsp; Mr. Moffat was a fat,

<P>jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat,

<P>jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter

<P>had done.&nbsp; Everyone petted her, and `Daisey', as they called her,

<P>was in a fair way to have her head turned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the evening for the small party came, she found that

<P>the poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting

<P>on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed.&nbsp; So out

<P>came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever

<P>beside Sallie's crisp new one.&nbsp; Meg saw the girls glance at it

<P>and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with

<P>all her gentleness she was very proud.&nbsp; No one said a word about

<P>it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her

<P>sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms.&nbsp; But

<P>in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her

<P>heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others

<P>laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.&nbsp; The

<P>hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid

<P>brought in a box of flowers.&nbsp; Before she could speak, Annie had

<P>the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath,

<P>and fern within.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some,

<P>but these are altogether ravishing," cried Annie, with a great

<P>sniff.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are for Miss March, the man said.&nbsp; And here's a note,"

<P>put in the maid, holding it to Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What fun!&nbsp; Who are they from?&nbsp; Didn't know you had a lover,"

<P>cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity

<P>and surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie," said

<P>Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, indeed!" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped

<P>the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy,

<P>vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her

<P>good, and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses

<P>for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for

<P>the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so

<P>prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was `the

<P>sweetest little thing she ever saw', and they looked quite

<P>charmed with her small attention.&nbsp; Somehow the kind act finished

<P>her despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves

<P>to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror,

<P>as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened

<P>the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very shabby

<P>now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced

<P>to her heart's content.&nbsp; Everyone was very kind, and she had

<P>three compliments.&nbsp; Annie made her sing, and some one said she

<P>had a remarkably fine voice.&nbsp; Major Lincoln asked who `the fresh

<P>little girl with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted

<P>on dancing with her because she `didn't dawdle, but had some spring

<P>in her', as he gracefully expressed it.&nbsp; So altogether she had
a

<P>very nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which

<P>disturbed her extremely.&nbsp; She was sitting just inside the

<P>conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she

<P>heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How old is he?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say," replied another voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't

<P>it?&nbsp; Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite

<P>dotes on them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. M.&nbsp; has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her

<P>cards well, early as it is.&nbsp; The girl evidently doesn't think of
it

<P>yet," said Mrs. Moffat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and

<P>colored up when the flowers came quite prettily.&nbsp; Poor thing!

<P>She'd be so nice if she was only got up in style.&nbsp; Do you think

<P>she'd be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?"

<P>asked another voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy

<P>tarlatan is all she has got.&nbsp; She may tear it tonight, and that

<P>will be a good excuse for offering a decent one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed

<P>and rather agitated.&nbsp; She was proud, and her pride was useful

<P>just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and

<P>disgust at what she had just heard.&nbsp; For, innocent and unsuspicious

<P>as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her

<P>friends.&nbsp; She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating

<P>to herself, "Mrs. M.&nbsp; has made her plans," "that fib about her

<P>mamma," and 'dowdy tarlatan," till she was ready to cry and rush

<P>home to tell her troubles and ask for advice.&nbsp; As that was impossible,

<P>she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she

<P>succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making.

<P>She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed,

<P>where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and

<P>her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.&nbsp; Those foolish,

<P>yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much

<P>disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived

<P>as happily as a child.&nbsp; Her innocent friendship with Laurie was

<P>spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard.&nbsp; Her faith in
her

<P>mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her

<P>by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible

<P>resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited

<P>a poor man's daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of

<P>girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities

<P>under heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy,

<P>half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for

<P>not speaking out frankly and setting everything right.&nbsp; Everybody

<P>dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found

<P>energy enough even to take up their worsted work.&nbsp; Something in

<P>the manner of her friends struck Meg at once.&nbsp; They treated her

<P>with more respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in

<P>what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed

<P>curiosity.&nbsp; All this surprised and flattered her, though she did

<P>not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and

<P>said, with a sentimental air...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr.

<P>Laurence, for Thursday.&nbsp; We should like to know him, and it's only

<P>a proper compliment to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made

<P>her reply demurely, "You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't

<P>come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why not, Cherie?" asked Miss Belle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's too old."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My child, what do you mean?&nbsp; What is his age, I beg to

<P>know!" cried Miss Clara.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nearly seventy, I believe," answered Meg, counting stitches

<P>to hide the merriment in her eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You sly creature!&nbsp; Of course we meant the young man,"

<P>exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy."&nbsp; And Meg

<P>laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she

<P>thus described her supposed lover.

<P>"About you age," Nan said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nearer my sister Jo's, I am seventeen in August," returned

<P>Meg, tossing her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?" said

<P>Annie, looking wise about nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and

<P>we are so fond of them.&nbsp; My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends,

<P>you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together."

<P>And Meg hoped they would say no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet," said Miss Clara to Belle with a
nod.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round," returned

<P>Miss Belle with a shrug.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls.&nbsp; Can

<P>I do anything for you, young ladies?" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering

<P>in like an elephant in silk and lace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, thank you, ma'am," replied Sallie.&nbsp; "I've got my new

<P>pink silk for Thursday and don't want a thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nor I..." began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to

<P>her that she did want several things and could not have them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall you wear?" asked Sallie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it

<P>got sadly torn last night," said Meg, trying to speak quite easily,

<P>but feeling very uncomfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why don't you send home for another?" said Sallie, who was

<P>not an observing young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't got any other."&nbsp; It cost Meg an effort to say that,

<P>but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, "Only

<P>that?" How funny..."&nbsp; She did not finish her speech, for Belle

<P>shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all.&nbsp; Where is the use of having a lot of dresses

<P>when she isn't out yet?&nbsp; There's no need of sending home, Daisy,

<P>even if you had a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away,

<P>which I've outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won't

<P>you, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you

<P>don't, it does well enough for a little girl like me," said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style.

<P>I admire to do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a

<P>touch here and there.&nbsp; I shan't let anyone see you till you are

<P>done, and then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her

<P>godmother going to the ball," said Belle in her persuasive tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to

<P>see if she would be `a little beauty' after touching up caused

<P>her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings

<P>toward the Moffats.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid,

<P>and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.&nbsp; They crimped

<P>and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some

<P>fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make

<P>them redder, and Hortense would have added `a soupcon of rouge',

<P>if Meg had not rebelled.&nbsp; They laced her into a sky-blue dress,

<P>which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the

<P>neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror.&nbsp; A set

<P>of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and

<P>even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink

<P>silk which did not show.&nbsp; A cluster of tea-rose buds at the

<P>bosom and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty,

<P>white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied

<P>the last wish of her heart.&nbsp; A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan,

<P>and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss

<P>Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with

<P>a newly dressed doll.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mademoiselle is chatmante, tres jolie, is she not?" cried

<P>Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come and show yourself," said Miss Belle, leading the way

<P>to the room where the others were waiting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing,

<P>her earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating,

<P>she felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror

<P>had plainly told her that she was `a little beauty'.&nbsp; Her friends

<P>repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several

<P>minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her

<P>borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her

<P>skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.&nbsp; Take

<P>your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side

<P>of her head, Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work

<P>of my hands," said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased

<P>with her success.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice.

<P>I'm nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're

<P>quite French, I assure you.&nbsp; Let your flowers hang, don't be so

<P>careful of them, and be sure you don't trip," returned Sallie, trying

<P>not to care that Meg was prettier than herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely

<P>downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and

<P>a few early guests were assembled.&nbsp; She very soon discovered that

<P>there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class

<P>of people and secures their respect.&nbsp; Several young ladies, who

<P>had taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of

<P>a sudden.&nbsp; Several young gentlemen, who had only stared at her
at

<P>the other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced,

<P>and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her, and

<P>several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest

<P>of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest.&nbsp; She

<P>heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first

<P>families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of

<P>the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild

<P>about her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me!" said the old lady, putting up her glass for

<P>another observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not

<P>heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.

<P>The `queer feeling' did not pass away, but she imagined

<P>herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty

<P>well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept

<P>getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest her

<P>earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.&nbsp; She was flirting

<P>her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman

<P>who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and

<P>looked confused, for just opposite, she saw Laurie.&nbsp; He was

<P>staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also,

<P>she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet something in

<P>his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on.

<P>To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both

<P>glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked

<P>unusually boyish and shy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.&nbsp; I won't

<P>care for it, or let it change me a bit," thought Meg, and rustled

<P>across the room to shake hands with her friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't." she said,

<P>with her most grown-up air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I

<P>did," answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though

<P>he half smiled at her maternal tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall you tell her?" asked Meg, full of curiosity to

<P>know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the

<P>first time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and

<P>unlike yourself, I'm quite afraid of you," he said, fumbling at

<P>his glove button.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How absurd of you!&nbsp; The girls dressed me up for fun, and I

<P>rather like it.&nbsp; Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?" said Meg, bent

<P>on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.

<P>"Yes, I think she would," returned Laurie gravely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you like me so?' asked Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I don't," was the blunt reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why not?" in an anxious tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically

<P>trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than

<P>his answer, which had not particle of his usual politeness in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't like fuss and feathers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself,

<P>and Meg walked away, saying petulantly, "You are the rudest boy I

<P>ever saw."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window

<P>to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably

<P>brilliant color.&nbsp; As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by,
and

<P>a minute after she heard him saying to his mother...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are making a fool of that little girl.&nbsp; I wanted you

<P>to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely.&nbsp; She's nothing

<P>but a doll tonight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear!" sighed Meg.&nbsp; "I wish I'd been sensible and worn

<P>my own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or

<P>felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half

<P>hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz

<P>had begun, till some one touched her, and turning, she saw

<P>Laurie, looking penitent, as he said, with his very best bow

<P>and his hand out...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid it will be to disagreeable to you," said Meg,

<P>trying to look offended and failing entirely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it.&nbsp; Come, I'll be good.

<P>I don't like your gown, but I do think you are just splendid."

<P>And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his

<P>admiration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting

<P>to catch the time, "Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up.&nbsp; It's

<P>the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful," said

<P>Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently

<P>approved of.

<P>Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced

<P>at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were

<P>a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round,

<P>feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?' said Meg,

<P>as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did

<P>very soon though she would not own why.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Won't I!" said Laurie, with alacrity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight.

<P>They won't understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then why did you do it?" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly

<P>that Meg hastily added...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall tell them myself all about it, and `fess' to Mother

<P>how silly I've been.&nbsp; But I'd rather do it myself.&nbsp; So you'll
not

<P>tell, will you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when

<P>they ask me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the

<P>other?&nbsp; You don't look as if you were having a good time.&nbsp;
Are

<P>you?' And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her

<P>answer in a whisper...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, not just now.&nbsp; Don't think I'm horrid.&nbsp; I only wanted

<P>a little fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting

<P>tired of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here comes Ned Moffat.&nbsp; What does he want?" said Laurie,

<P>knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host

<P>in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's

<P>coming for them.&nbsp; What a bore!" said Meg, assuming a languid air

<P>which amused Laurie immensely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw

<P>her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were

<P>behaving `like a pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for

<P>he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and

<P>fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink

<P>much of that.&nbsp; I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you

<P>know," he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to

<P>refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not Meg tonight, I'm `a doll' who does all sorts of

<P>crazy things.&nbsp; Tomorrow I shall put away my `fuss and feathers'

<P>and be desperately good again," se answered with an affected

<P>little laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wish tomorrow was here, then," muttered Laurie, walking off,

<P>ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other

<P>girls did.&nbsp; After supper she undertook the German, and blundered

<P>through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and

<P>romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated

<P>a lecture.&nbsp; But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away

<P>from him till he came to say good night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Remember!" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting

<P>headache had already begun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Silence a` la mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatic

<P>flourish, as he went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg

<P>was too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had

<P>been to a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she

<P>expected.&nbsp; She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went
home,

<P>quite used up with her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had

<P>`sat in the lap of luxury' long enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company

<P>manners on all the time.&nbsp; Home is a nice place, though it isn't

<P>splendid," said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression,

<P>as she sat with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home

<P>would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters," replied

<P>her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day.&nbsp; For

<P>motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children's faces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what

<P>a charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh

<P>upon her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she

<P>sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking

<P>worried.&nbsp; As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg

<P>suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows

<P>on her mother's knee, saying bravely...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Marmee, I want to `fess'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought so.&nbsp; What is it, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I go away?" asked Jo discreetly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course not.&nbsp; Don't I always tell you everything?&nbsp; I was

<P>ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you

<P>to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are prepared," said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a

<P>little anxious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that

<P>they powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a

<P>fashion plate.&nbsp; Laurie thought I wasn't proper.&nbsp; I know he
did,

<P>though he didn't say so, and one man called me `a doll'.&nbsp; I knew

<P>it was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and

<P>quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is that all?" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at

<P>the downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it

<P>in her heart to blame her little follies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and

<P>was altogether abominable," said Meg self-reproachfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is something more, I think."&nbsp; And Mrs. March smoothed

<P>the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate

<P>to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the

<P>Moffats', and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly,

<P>as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent

<P>mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard," cried

<P>Jo indignantly.&nbsp; "Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the

<P>spot?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me.&nbsp; I couldn't help

<P>hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't

<P>remember that I ought to go away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to

<P>settle such ridiculous stuff.&nbsp; The idea of having `plans' and being

<P>kind to Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by!&nbsp; Won't

<P>he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor

<P>children?" And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing

<P>struck her as a good joke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you!&nbsp; She mustn't,

<P>must she, Mother?" said Meg, looking distressed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon

<P>as you can," said Mrs. March gravely.&nbsp; "I was very unwise to let

<P>you go among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say,

<P>but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young

<P>people.&nbsp; I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this

<P>visit may have done you, Meg."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me.&nbsp; I'll forget all the

<P>bad and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and

<P>thank you very much for letting me go.&nbsp; I'll not be sentimental
or

<P>dissatisfied, Mother.&nbsp; I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll

<P>stay with you till I'm fit to take care of myself.&nbsp; But it is nice

<P>to be praised and admired, and I can't help saying I like it," said

<P>Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking

<P>does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly

<P>things.&nbsp; Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having,

<P>and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest

<P>as well as pretty, Meg."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands

<P>behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it

<P>was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration,

<P>lovers, and things of that sort.&nbsp; And Jo felt as if during that

<P>fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away

<P>from her into a world where she could not follow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother, do you have `plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?" asked Meg

<P>bashfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine

<P>differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect.&nbsp; I will tell you

<P>some of them, for the time has come when a word may set this

<P>romantic little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious

<P>subject.&nbsp; You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me,

<P>and mothers' lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls

<P>like you.&nbsp; Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen
to

<P>my `plans' and help me carry them out, if they are good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she

<P>thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair.

<P>Holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully,

<P>Mrs. March said, in her serious yet cheery way...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good.

<P>To be admired, loved, and respected.&nbsp; To have a happy youth, to

<P>be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives,

<P>with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send.

<P>To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing

<P>which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may

<P>know this beautiful experience.&nbsp; It is natural to think of it,
Meg,

<P>right to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that

<P>when the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and

<P>worthy of the joy.&nbsp; My dear girls, I am ambitious for you, but
not

<P>to have you make a dash in the world, marry rich men merely because

<P>they are rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because

<P>love is wanting.&nbsp; Money is a needful and precious thing, and when

<P>well used, a noble thing, but I never want you to think it is the

<P>first or only prize to strive for.&nbsp; I'd rather see you poor men's

<P>wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones,

<P>without self-respect and peace."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they

<P>put themselves forward," sighed Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then we'll be old maids," said Jo stoutly.

<P>"right, Jo.&nbsp; Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or

<P>unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands," said Mrs. March

<P>decidedly.&nbsp; "Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere

<P>lover.&nbsp; Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor

<P>girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids.

<P>Leave these things to time.&nbsp; Make this home happy, so that you
may

<P>be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented

<P>here if they are not.&nbsp; One thing remember, my girls.&nbsp; Mother
is

<P>always ready to be your confidante, Father to be your friend, and

<P>both of hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single,

<P>will be the pride and comfort of out lives."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We will, Marmee, we will!" cried both, with all their hearts,

<P>as she bade them good night.
