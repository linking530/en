<P>"That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?" said Amy one day,

<P>as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip

<P>as he passed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes?&nbsp; And

<P>very handsome ones they are, too," cried Jo, who resented any

<P>slighting remarks about her friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't day anything about his eyes, and I don't see why

<P>you need fire up when I admire his riding."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, my goodness!&nbsp; That little goose means a centaur, and she

<P>called him a Cyclops," exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.

<P>"You needn't be so rude, it's only a `lapse of lingy', as Mr.

<P>Davis says," retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.&nbsp; "I just

<P>wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse," she

<P>added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why?" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh

<P>at Amy's second blunder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I need it so much.&nbsp; I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be

<P>my turn to have the rag money for a month."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In debt, Amy?&nbsp; What do you mean?" And Meg looked sober.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay

<P>them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having

<P>anything charged at the shop."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me all about it.&nbsp; Are limes the fashion now?&nbsp; It used

<P>to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls."&nbsp; And Meg tried to

<P>keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless

<P>you want to be thought mean, you must do it too.&nbsp; It's nothing

<P>but limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in

<P>schooltime, and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper

<P>dolls, or something else, at recess.&nbsp; If one girl likes another,

<P>she gives her a lime.&nbsp; If she's mad with her, she eats one before

<P>her face, and doesn't offer even a suck.&nbsp; They treat by turns,

<P>and I've had ever so many but haven't returned them, and I ought

<P>for they are debts of honor, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How much will pay them off and restore your credit?" asked

<P>Meg, taking out her purse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over

<P>for a treat for you.&nbsp; Don't you like limes?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not much.&nbsp; You may have my share.&nbsp; Here's the money.&nbsp;
Make it

<P>last as long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, thank you!&nbsp; It must be so nice to have pocket money!&nbsp;
I'll

<P>have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week.&nbsp; I felt

<P>delicate about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm

<P>actually suffering for one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the

<P>temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper

<P>parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.

<P>During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-

<P>four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to

<P>treat circulated through her `set', and the attentions of her friends

<P>became quite overwhelming.&nbsp; Katy Brown invited her to her next
party

<P>on the spot.&nbsp; Mary Kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till

<P>recess, and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted

<P>Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered

<P>to furnish answers to certain appalling sums.&nbsp; But Amy had not

<P>forgotten Miss Snow's cutting remarks about `some persons whose noses

<P>were not too flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people

<P>who were not too proud to ask for them', and she instantly crushed

<P>`that Snow girl's' hopes by the withering telegram, "You needn't be

<P>so polite all of a sudden, for you won't get any."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that

<P>morning, and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which

<P>honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss

<P>March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock.&nbsp; But, alas,

<P>alas!&nbsp; Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned
the

<P>tables with disastrous success.&nbsp; No sooner had the guest paid the

<P>usual stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under

<P>pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the

<P>teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and

<P>solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found

<P>breaking the law.&nbsp; This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing

<P>chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the

<P>confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post

<P>office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and

<P>caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred

<P>rebellious girls in order.&nbsp; Boys are trying enough to human patience,

<P>goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to

<P>nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for

<P>teaching than Dr. Blimber.&nbsp; Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek,

<P>Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine

<P>teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not

<P>considered of any particular importance.&nbsp; It was a most unfortunate

<P>moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it.&nbsp; Mr. Davis had

<P>evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was an

<P>east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had

<P>not done him the credit which he felt he deserved.&nbsp; Therefore,
to

<P>use the expressive, if not elegant, language of a schoolgirl, "He

<P>was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear".&nbsp; The word `limes'

<P>was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on

<P>his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with

<P>unusual rapidity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Young ladies, attention, if you please!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue,

<P>black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful

<P>countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss March, come to the desk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear

<P>oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk," was the

<P>unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't take all." whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great

<P>presence of mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before

<P>Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent

<P>when that delicious perfume met his nose.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mr. Davis

<P>particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust

<P>added to his wrath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is that all?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite," stammered Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bring the rest immediately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are sure there are no more?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never lie, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I see.&nbsp; Now take these disgusting things two by two, and

<P>throw them out of the window."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust,

<P>as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing

<P>lips.&nbsp; Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful

<P>times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell

<P>from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish

<P>of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over

<P>by the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.&nbsp; This--this

<P>was too much.&nbsp; All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the

<P>inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous

<P>"Hem!" and said, in his most impressive manner...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.&nbsp; I

<P>am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed,

<P>and I never break my word.&nbsp; Miss March, hold out your hand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an

<P>imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could

<P>not utter.&nbsp; She was rather a favorite with `old Davis', as, of
course,

<P>he was called, and it's my private belief that he would have broken

<P>his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not

<P>found vent in a hiss.&nbsp; That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the

<P>irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your hand, Miss March!" was the only answer her mute appeal

<P>received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw

<P>bach her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling

<P>blows on her little palm.&nbsp; They were neither many nor heavy, but
that

<P>made no difference to her.&nbsp; For the first time in her life she
had

<P>been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had

<P>knocked her down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will now stand on the platform till recess," said Mr. Davis,

<P>resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was dreadful.&nbsp; It would have been bad enough to go to her

<P>seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied

<P>ones of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that

<P>shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt

<P>as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart

<P>with crying.&nbsp; A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny
Snow

<P>helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed

<P>her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces,

<P>and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it

<P>hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive

<P>little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.&nbsp;
To

<P>others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was

<P>a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been

<P>governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her

<P>before.&nbsp; The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten

<P>in the sting of the thought, "I shall have to tell at home, and they

<P>will be so disappointed in me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at

<P>last, and the word `Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can go, Miss March," said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,

<P>uncomfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as

<P>she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom,

<P>snatched her things, and left the place "forever," as she passionately

<P>declared to herself.&nbsp; She was in a sad state when she got home,
and

<P>when the older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting

<P>was held at once.&nbsp; Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed,

<P>and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner.

<P>Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt

<P>that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like

<P>this, Jo wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay,

<P>and Hannah shook her fist at the `villain' and pounded potatoes for

<P>dinner as if she had him under her pestle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but

<P>the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite

<P>benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous.&nbsp; Just before

<P>school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she

<P>stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother,

<P>then collected Amy's property, and departed, carefully scraping

<P>the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook that dust

<P>of the place off her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to

<P>study a little every day with Beth," said Mrs. March that evening.

<P>"I don't approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.&nbsp;
I

<P>dislike Mr. Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls

<P>you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your

<P>father's advice before I send you anywhere else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's good!&nbsp; I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil

<P>his old school.&nbsp; It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely

<P>limes," sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and

<P>deserved some punishment for disobedience," was the severe reply,

<P>which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but

<P>sympathy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole

<P>school?" cried Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,"

<P>replied her mother, "but I'm not sure that it won't do you more

<P>good than a molder method.&nbsp; You are getting to be rather conceited,

<P>my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it.&nbsp; You

<P>have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of

<P>parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius.&nbsp; There is
not

<P>much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long,

<P>even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well

<P>should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So it is!" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner

<P>with Jo.&nbsp; "I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent

<P>for music, and she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little

<P>things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed

<P>it if anyone had told her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I'd known that nice girl.&nbsp; Maybe she would have helped

<P>me, I'm so stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, listening

<P>eagerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else

<P>could," answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous

<P>meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very

<P>red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such

<P>an unexpected discovery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth,

<P>who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment.

<P>So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly

<P>lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side

<P>of his character.&nbsp; When he was gone, amy, who had been pensive

<P>all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,

<P>"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent.

<P>He will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting," replied her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And he isn't conceited, is he?" asked Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not in the least.&nbsp; That is why he is so charming and we all

<P>like him so much."

<P>"I see.&nbsp; It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but

<P>not to show off or get perked up," said Amy thoughtfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner

<P>and conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to

<P>display them," said Mrs. March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns

<P>and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added Jo,

<P>and the lecture ended in a laugh.
