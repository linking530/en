<P>New York, November
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear Marmee and Beth,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps

<P>to tell, though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on the continent.

<P>When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a

<P>trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an

<P>Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,

<P>hadn't diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread

<P>nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I

<P>cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once,

<P>even in that big house full of strangers.&nbsp; She gave me a funny

<P>little sky parlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a

<P>nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever

<P>I like.&nbsp; A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for

<P>the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot.

<P>The nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next

<P>Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty

<P>children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after

<P>telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make

<P>a model governess.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to

<P>the great table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful,

<P>though no one will believe it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, my dear, make yourself at home," said Mrs. K.&nbsp; in her

<P>motherly way, "I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you

<P>may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will be off

<P>my mind if I know the children are safe with you.&nbsp; My rooms are

<P>always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I

<P>can make it.&nbsp; There are some pleasant people in the house if you

<P>feel sociable, and your evenings are always free.&nbsp; Come to me

<P>if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can.&nbsp; There's the

<P>tea bell, I must run and change my cap."&nbsp; And off she bustled,

<P>leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked.

<P>The flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood

<P>waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl

<P>to lumber up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the

<P>heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put

<P>it down at a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind

<P>nod and a foreign accent, "It goes better so.&nbsp; The little back

<P>is too young to haf such heaviness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wasn't it good of him?&nbsp; I like such things, for as Father

<P>says, trifles show character.&nbsp; When I mentioned it to Mrs. K.,

<P>that evening, she laughed, and said, "That must have been

<P>Professor Bhaer, he's always doing things of that sort."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. K.&nbsp; told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good,

<P>but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself

<P>and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according

<P>to the wishes of his sister, who married an American.&nbsp; Not

<P>a very romantic story, but it interested me, and I was glad to

<P>hear that Mrs. K.&nbsp; lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.

<P>There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to

<P>peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks.&nbsp; He's almost

<P>forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I

<P>attacked the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting

<P>with my new friend.&nbsp; I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it

<P>once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tuesday Eve
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the

<P>children acted like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I

<P>should shake them all round.&nbsp; Some good angel inspired me to

<P>try gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down

<P>and keep still.&nbsp; After luncheon, the girl took them out for a

<P>walk, and I went to my needlework like little Mabel `with a

<P>willing mind'.&nbsp; I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to

<P>make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut,

<P>and someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee.

<P>It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't

<P>resist the temptation, and lifting one end of the curtain

<P>before the glass door, I peeped in.&nbsp; Professor Bhaer was there,

<P>and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at him.&nbsp; A

<P>regular German--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled all over

<P>his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I ever

<P>saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after

<P>our sharp or slipshod American gabble.&nbsp; His clothes were rusty,

<P>his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome feature

<P>in his face, except his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for

<P>he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, and he looked

<P>like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat and

<P>there was a patch on one shoe.&nbsp; He looked sober in spite of

<P>his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth

<P>bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him

<P>like an old friend.&nbsp; Then he smiled, and when a tap came at

<P>the door, called out in a loud, brisk tone, "Herein!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of

<P>a child carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going

<P>on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me wants me Bhaer," said the mite, slamming down her book

<P>and running to meet him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer.&nbsp; Come, then, and take a goot

<P>hug from him, my Tina," said the Professor, catching her up

<P>with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she

<P>had to stoop her little face to kiss him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now me mus tuddy my lessin," went on the funny little

<P>thing.&nbsp; So he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary

<P>she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and

<P>she scribbled away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing

<P>her little fat finger down the page, as if finding a word,

<P>so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while

<P>Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look

<P>that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more

<P>French than German.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent

<P>me back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all

<P>the noise and gabbling that went on next door.&nbsp; One of the girls

<P>kept laughing affectedly, and saying, "Now Professor," in a

<P>coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an

<P>accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once

<P>I heard him say emphatically, "No, no, it is not so, you haf

<P>not attend to what I say," and once there was a loud rap, as

<P>if he struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing

<P>exclamation, "Prut!&nbsp; It all goes bad this day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took

<P>just one more peep to see if he survived it.&nbsp; He seemed to have

<P>thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with

<P>his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put

<P>his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and

<P>taking little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his

<P>arms, he carried her quietly away.&nbsp; I fancy he has a hard life

<P>of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five

<P>o'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought

<P>I would, just to see what sort of people are under the same

<P>roof with me.&nbsp; So I made myself respectable and tried to slip

<P>in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as she is short and I'm tall, my

<P>efforts at concealment were rather a failure.&nbsp; She gave me a

<P>seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage

<P>and looked about me.&nbsp; The long table was full, and every--

<P>one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially,

<P>who seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every

<P>sense of the word, vanishing as soon as they were done.&nbsp; There

<P>was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves,

<P>young couples absorbed in each other, married ladies in their

<P>babies, and old gentlemen in politics.&nbsp; I don't think I shall

<P>care to have much to do with any of them, except one sweetfaced

<P>maiden lady, who looks as if she had something in her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor,

<P>shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive,

<P>deaf old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with

<P>a Frenchman on the other.&nbsp; If Amy had been here, she'd have

<P>turned her back on him forever because, sad to relate, he had

<P>a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which

<P>would have horrified `her ladyship'.&nbsp; I didn't mind, for I like

<P>`to see folks eat with a relish', as Hannah says, and the poor

<P>man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men

<P>were settling their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard

<P>one say low to the other, "Who's the new party?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Governess, or something of that sort."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What the deuce is she at our table for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Friend of the old lady's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Handsome head, but no style."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a bit of it.&nbsp; Give us a light and come on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess

<P>is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't

<P>style, which is more than some people have, judging from the

<P>remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like

<P>bad chimneys.&nbsp; I hate ordinary people!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thursday
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and

<P>writing in my little room, which is very cozy, with a light and

<P>fire.&nbsp; I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the

<P>Professor.&nbsp; It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman

<P>who does the fine ironing in the laundry here.&nbsp; The little thing

<P>has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house

<P>like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is

<P>very fond of children, though a `bacheldore'.&nbsp; Kitty and Minnie

<P>Kirk likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of

<P>stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and

<P>the splendid tales he tells.&nbsp; The younger men quiz him, it seems,

<P>call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner

<P>of jokes on his name.&nbsp; But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke

<P>says, and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in

<P>spite of his foreign ways.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and

<P>kind.&nbsp; She spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table

<P>again, it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to come

<P>and see her at her room.&nbsp; She has fine books and pictures,

<P>knows interesting persons, and seems friendly, so I shall make

<P>myself agreeable, for I do want to get into good society, only

<P>it isn't the same sort that Amy likes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in

<P>with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke.&nbsp; She wasn't there, but

<P>Minnie, who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily.

<P>"This is Mamma's friend, Miss March."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and she's jolly and we like her lots," added Kitty,

<P>who is and `enfant terrible'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction

<P>and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees

<P>Marsch.&nbsp; If so again, call at me and I come," he said, with a

<P>threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I

<P>was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as I passed

<P>his door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with

<P>my umbrella.&nbsp; It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing

<P>gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle

<P>in the other.&nbsp; He didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when

<P>I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all,

<P>saying in his loud, cheerful way...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You haf a fine day to make your walk.&nbsp; Bon voyage, Mademoiselle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic,

<P>also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.

<P>The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is

<P>another thing and not so pretty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss

<P>Norton, who has a room full of pretty things, and who was very

<P>charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if

<P>I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as her

<P>escort, if I enjoyed them.&nbsp; She put it as a favor, but I'm sure

<P>Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness

<P>to me.&nbsp; I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from such

<P>people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.

<P>When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar

<P>in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down

<P>on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading

<P>him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with

<P>seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are playing nargerie," explained Kitty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dis is mine effalunt!" added Tina, holding on by the

<P>Professor's hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon,

<P>when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?"

<P>said Minnie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The `effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any

<P>of them, and said soberly to me, "I gif you my wort it is so,

<P>if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we

<P>go more softly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the

<P>fun as much as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never

<P>witnessed.&nbsp; They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang,

<P>and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about

<P>the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks

<P>on the chimney tops, and the little `koblods', who ride the

<P>snowflakes as they fall.&nbsp; I wish Americans were as simple and

<P>natural as Germans, don't you?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if

<P>motives of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin

<P>paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this

<P>long letter will need.&nbsp; Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can

<P>spare them.&nbsp; My small news will sound very flat after her

<P>splendors, but you will like them, I know.&nbsp; Is Teddy studying

<P>so hard that he can't find time to write to his friends?&nbsp; Take

<P>good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies,

<P>and give heaps of love to everyone.&nbsp; From your faithful Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>P.S.&nbsp; On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather

<P>Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and I really

<P>had nothing else to write about.&nbsp; Bless you!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>DECEMBER
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Precious Betsey,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to

<P>you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings

<P>on, for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh,

<P>be joyful!&nbsp; After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in

<P>the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin

<P>to shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish.&nbsp; They are

<P>not so interesting tome as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty

<P>by them, and they are fond of me.&nbsp; Franz and Emil are jolly

<P>little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture of

<P>German and American spirit in the produces a constant state of

<P>effervescence.&nbsp; Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether

<P>spent in the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to

<P>walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep

<P>order, and then such fun!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take

<P>lessons.&nbsp; I really couldn't help it, and it all came about in

<P>such a droll way that I must tell you.&nbsp; To begin at the beginning,

<P>Mrs. Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room

<P>where she was rummaging.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you ever see such a den, my dear?&nbsp; Just come and

<P>help me put these books to rights, for I've turned everything

<P>upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six

<P>new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it

<P>was `a den' to be sure.&nbsp; Books and papers everywhere, a broken

<P>meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done

<P>with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window

<P>seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other.&nbsp; Half-finished

<P>boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts.&nbsp; Dirty

<P>little boots stood drying before the fire, and traces of the

<P>dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of himself,

<P>were to be seen all over the room.&nbsp; After a grand rummage

<P>three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird

<P>cage, one covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having

<P>been used as a holder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such a man!" laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the

<P>relics in the rag bay.&nbsp; "I suppose the others are torn up to

<P>rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails.&nbsp; It's dreadful,

<P>but I can't scold him.&nbsp; He's so absent-minded and goodnatured,

<P>he lets those boys ride over him roughshod.&nbsp; I agreed to do

<P>his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things

<P>and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let me mend them," said I.&nbsp; "I don't mind it, and he needn't

<P>know.&nbsp; I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing my letters

<P>and lending books."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two

<P>pairs of the socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his

<P>queer darns.&nbsp; Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it

<P>out, but one day last week he caught me at it.&nbsp; Hearing the

<P>lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much

<P>that I took a fancy to lear, for Tina runs in and out, leaving

<P>the door open, and I can hear.&nbsp; I had been sitting near this

<P>door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what

<P>he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am.&nbsp; The girl

<P>had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was

<P>busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most

<P>absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was

<P>Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to

<P>Tina not to betray him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So!" he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, "you

<P>peep at me, I peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am

<P>not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, but you are too busy.&nbsp; I am too stupid to learn," I

<P>blundered out, as red as a peony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Prut!&nbsp; We will make the time, and we fail not to find the

<P>sense.&nbsp; At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness,

<P>for look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay."&nbsp; And

<P>he pointed to my work `Yes, ' they say to one another, these so

<P>kind ladies, `he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we

<P>do, he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes

<P>any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall,

<P>and believe that strings make theirselves.' "Ah!&nbsp; But I haf an

<P>eye, and I see much.&nbsp; I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.

<P>Come, a little lesson then and now, or no more good fairy works

<P>for me and mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it

<P>really is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we

<P>began.&nbsp; I took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical

<P>bog.&nbsp; The Professor was very patient with me, but it must

<P>have been torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me

<P>with such an expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up

<P>with me whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp; I tried both ways, and when

<P>it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just

<P>threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room.

<P>I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever, but didn't blame

<P>him a particle, and was scrambling my papers together, meaning

<P>to rush upstairs and shake myself hard, when in he came, as

<P>brisk and beaming as if I'd covered myself in glory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now we shall try a new way.&nbsp; You and I will read these

<P>pleasant little MARCHEN together, and dig no more in that dry

<P>book, that goes in the corner for making us trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersons's fairy

<P>tales so invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than

<P>ever, and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that

<P>seemed to amuse him immensely.&nbsp; I forgot my bashfulness, and

<P>pegged away (no other word will express it) with all my might,

<P>tumbling over long words, pronouncing according to inspiration

<P>of the minute, and doing my very best.&nbsp; When I finished reading

<P>my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and

<P>cried out in his hearty way, "Das ist gut!' Now we go well!&nbsp; My

<P>turn.&nbsp; I do him in German, gif me your ear."&nbsp; And away he
went,

<P>rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which

<P>was good to see as well as hear.&nbsp; Fortunately the story was the

<P>CONSTANT TIN SOLDIER, which is droll, you know, so I could laugh,

<P>and I did, though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't

<P>help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so

<P>comical.

<P>After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons

<P>pretty well, for this way of studying suits me, and I can see

<P>that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one

<P>gives pills in jelly.&nbsp; I like it very much, and he doesn't seem

<P>tired of it yet, which is very good of him, isn't it?&nbsp; I mean

<P>to give him something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money.

<P>Tell me something nice, Marmee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given

<P>up smoking and lets his hair grow.&nbsp; You see Beth manages him

<P>better than I did.&nbsp; I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only

<P>don't make a saint of him.&nbsp; I'm afraid I couldn't like him

<P>without a spice of human naughtiness.&nbsp; Read him bits of my

<P>letters.&nbsp; I haven't time to write much, and that will do just

<P>as well.&nbsp; Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>JANUARY
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of

<P>course includes Mr. L.&nbsp; and a young man by the name of Teddy.

<P>I can't tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle,

<P>for i didn't get it till night and had given up hoping.&nbsp; Your

<P>letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a

<P>parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was disappointed,

<P>for I'd had a `kind of feeling' that you wouldn't forget me.

<P>I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after

<P>tea, and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was

<P>brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced.&nbsp; It was so

<P>homey and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read

<P>and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual absurd

<P>way.&nbsp; The things were just what I wanted, and all the better

<P>for being made instead of bought.&nbsp; Beth's new `ink bib' was

<P>capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a

<P>treasure.&nbsp; I'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent,

<P>Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has marked.&nbsp; Thank

<P>you all, heaps and heaps!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that

<P>line, for on New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare.

<P>It is one he values much, and I've often admired it,

<P>set up in the place of honor with his German Bible, Plato,

<P>Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how I felt when he brought

<P>it down, without its cover, and showed me my own name in it,

<P>"from my friend Friedrich Bhaer".
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You say often you wish a library.&nbsp; Here I gif you one, for

<P>between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one.&nbsp; Read

<P>him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character

<P>in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it

<P>with your pen."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about `my

<P>library', as if I had a hundred books.&nbsp; I never knew how much

<P>there was in Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer

<P>to explain it to me.&nbsp; Now don't laugh at his horrid name.&nbsp;
It

<P>isn't pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people will say it,

<P>but something between the two, as only Germans can give it.

<P>I'm glad you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you

<P>will know him some day.&nbsp; Mother would admire his warm heart,

<P>Father his wise head.&nbsp; I admire both, and feel rich in my new

<P>`friend Friedrich Bhaer'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got

<P>several little things, and put them about the room, where he

<P>would find them unexpectedly.&nbsp; They were useful, pretty, or

<P>funny, a new standish on his table, a little vase for his

<P>flower, he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to

<P>keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his blower, so

<P>that he needn't burn up what Amy calls `mouchoirs'.&nbsp; I made

<P>it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body,

<P>and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes.

<P>It took his fancy immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece

<P>as an article of virtue, so it was rather a failure after all.

<P>Poor as he is, he didn't forget a servant or a child in the

<P>house, and not a soul here, from the French laundrywoman to

<P>Miss Norton forgot him.&nbsp; I was so glad of that.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's

<P>Eve.&nbsp; I didn't mean to go down, having no dress.&nbsp; But at the

<P>last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss

<P>Norton lent me lace and feathers.&nbsp; So I dressed up as Mrs.

<P>Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on.&nbsp; No one knew me, for I

<P>disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of the silent, haughty

<P>Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and cool, most of

<P>them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and dress,

<P>and burst out into a `nice derangement of epitaphs, like an

<P>allegory on the banks of the Nile'.&nbsp; I enjoyed it very much,

<P>and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me.&nbsp; I

<P>heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I'd been

<P>an actress, in fact, he thought he remembered seeing me at

<P>one of the minor theaters.&nbsp; Meg will relish that joke.&nbsp; Mr.

<P>Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a perfect little

<P>fairy in his arms.&nbsp; To see them dance was `quite a landscape',

<P>to use a Teddyism.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought

<P>it over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in

<P>spite of my many failures, for I'm cheerful all the time now,

<P>work with a will, and take more interest in other people than

<P>I used to, which is satisfactory.&nbsp; Bless you all!&nbsp; Ever your

<P>loving...&nbsp; Jo
