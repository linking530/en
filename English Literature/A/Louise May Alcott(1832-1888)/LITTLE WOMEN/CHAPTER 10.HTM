<P>As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the

<P>fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for

<P>work and play of all sorts.&nbsp; The garden had to be put in order,

<P>and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she

<P>liked with.&nbsp; Hannah used to say, "I'd know which each of them

<P>gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny," and so she might,

<P>for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.&nbsp; Meg's

<P>had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.

<P>Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying

<P>experiments.&nbsp; This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers,

<P>the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed

<P>Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks.&nbsp; Beth had old-fashioned

<P>fragrant flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette,

<P>larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for

<P>the birds and catnip for the pussies.&nbsp; Amy had a bower in hers,

<P>rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with

<P>honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and

<P>bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate

<P>ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent

<P>to blossom there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed

<P>the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions,

<P>some old, some new, all more or less original.&nbsp; One of these

<P>was the `P.C', for as secret societies were the fashion,

<P>it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls

<P>admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club.&nbsp; With

<P>a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met

<P>every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which occasions the

<P>ceremonies were as follows:&nbsp; Three chairs were arranged in a row

<P>before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with

<P>a big `P.C.' in different colors on each, and the weekly

<P>newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed

<P>something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor.

<P>At seven o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom,

<P>tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with

<P>great solemnity.&nbsp; Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo,

<P>being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass, Beth, because she

<P>was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who was always trying

<P>to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.&nbsp; Pickwick, the

<P>president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales,

<P>poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which

<P>they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and

<P>short comings.&nbsp; On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair

<P>of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed,

<P>and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back

<P>in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read:

<P>THE MASKED MARRIAGE

<P>(A Tale Of Venice)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble

<P>steps, and left its lovely load to swell the

<P>brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count

<P>Adelon.&nbsp; Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks

<P>and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.

<P>Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so

<P>with mirth and music the masquerade went on.

<P>"Has your Highness seen the Lady viola tonight?"

<P>asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who

<P>floated down the hall upon his arm.

<P>"Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad!&nbsp; Her

<P>dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds

<P>Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By my faith, I envy him.&nbsp; Yonder he comes,

<P>arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.

<P>When that is off we shall see how he regards the

<P>fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her

<P>stern father bestows her hand," returned the troubadour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tis whispered that she loves the young English

<P>artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the

<P>old Count," said the lady, as they joined the dance.

<P>The revel was at its height when a priest

<P>appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,

<P>hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel.

<P>Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a

<P>sound, but he dash of fountains or the rustle of

<P>orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the

<P>hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which

<P>I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of

<P>my daughter.&nbsp; Father, we wait your services."

<P>All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a

<P>murmur of amazement went through the throng, for

<P>neither bride nor groom removed their masks.&nbsp; Curiosity

<P>and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained

<P>all tongues till the holy rite was over.&nbsp; Then the

<P>eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding

<P>an explanation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only

<P>know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I

<P>yielded to it.&nbsp; Now, my children, let the play end.

<P>Unmask and receive my blessing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom

<P>replied in a tone that startled all listeners

<P>as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand

<P>Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the

<P>breast where now flashed the star of an English earl

<P>was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your

<P>daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a

<P>fortune as the Count antonio.&nbsp; I can do more, for even

<P>your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux

<P>and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless

<P>wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,

<P>now my wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The count stood like one changed to stone, and

<P>turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with

<P>a gay smile of triumph, "To you, my gallant friends, I

<P>can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has

<P>done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have

<P>by this masked marriage."

<P>THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed.

<P>in his garden, and after a while it sprouted and became

<P>a vine and bore many squashes.&nbsp; One day in October,

<P>when they were ripe, he picked one and took it

<P>to market.&nbsp; A gorcerman bought and put it in his shop.

<P>That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat

<P>and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went

<P>and bought it for her mother.&nbsp; She lugged it home, cut

<P>it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it

<P>salt and butter, for dinner.&nbsp; And to the rest she added

<P>a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,

<P>and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it

<P>till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten

<P>by a family named March.

<P>A SAD ACCIDENT

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock

<P>in our basement, followed by cries of distress.

<P>On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved

<P>President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and

<P>fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes.&nbsp; A perfect

<P>scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick

<P>had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,

<P>upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form,&nbsp; and torn

<P>his garments badly.&nbsp; On being removed from this perilous

<P>situation, it was discovered that he had suffered

<P>no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add,

<P>is now doing well.

<P>THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is our painful duty to record the sudden and

<P>mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs.

<P>Snowball Pat Paw.&nbsp; This lovely and beloved cat was the

<P>pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; for

<P>her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues

<P>endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt

<P>by the whole community.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching

<P>the butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain,

<P>tempted by her charms, basely stole her.&nbsp; Weeks have passed,

<P>but no trace of her has been discovered, and we relinquish

<P>all hope, tie a black ribbon to her basket, set aside her

<P>dish, and weep for her as one lost to us forever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A LAMENT

<P>(FOR S.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; PAT PAW)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We mourn the loss of our little pet,

<P>And sigh o'er her hapless fate,

<P>For never more by the fire she'll sit,

<P>Nor play by the old green gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little grave where her infant sleeps

<P>Is 'neath the chestnut tree.

<P>But o'er her grave we may not weep,

<P>We know not where it may be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her empty bed, her idle ball,

<P>Will never see her more;

<P>No gentle tap, no loving purr

<P>Is heard at the parlor door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another cat comes after her mice,

<P>A cat with a dirty face,

<P>But she does not hunt as our darling did,

<P>Nor play with her airy grace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her stealthy paws tread the very hall

<P>Where Snowball used to play,

<P>But she only spits at the dogs our pet

<P>So gallantly drove away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She is useful and mild, and does her best,

<P>But she is not fair to see,

<P>And we cannot give her your place dear,

<P>Nor worship her as we worship thee.

<P>As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg

<P>leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written

<P>by bona fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause

<P>followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. President and gentlemen," he began, assuming a

<P>parliamentary attitude and tone, "I wish to propose the admission

<P>of a new member--one who highly deserves the honor, would be

<P>deeply grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit

<P>of the club, the literary value of the paper, and be no end

<P>jolly and nice.&nbsp; I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary

<P>member of the P.&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Come now, do have him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all

<P>looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass

<P>took his seat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We'll put it to a vote," said the President.&nbsp; "All in

<P>favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, `Aye'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Contrary-minded say, `No'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to

<P>say with great elegance, "We don't wish any boys, they only

<P>joke and bounce about.&nbsp; This is a ladies' club, and we wish to

<P>be private and proper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us

<P>afterward," observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her

<P>forehead, as she always did when doubtful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.&nbsp; "Sir, I give you

<P>my word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort.&nbsp;
He

<P>likes to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and

<P>keep us from being sentimental, don't you see?&nbsp; We can do so little

<P>for him, and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do

<P>is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to

<P>his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, we ought to do it, even if we are afraid.&nbsp; I say he may

<P>come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo

<P>left her seat to shake hands approvingly.&nbsp; "Now then, vote again.

<P>Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, `Aye!'"

<P>cried Snodgrass excitedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye!&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; Aye!" replied three voices at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good!&nbsp; Bless you!&nbsp; Now, as there's nothing like `taking time

<P>by the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me

<P>to present the new member."&nbsp; And, to the dismay of the rest of
the

<P>club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie

<P>sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You rogue!&nbsp; You traitor!&nbsp; Jo, how could you?" cried the three

<P>girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing

<P>both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing," began Mr. Pickwick,

<P>trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing

<P>an amiable smile.&nbsp; But the new member was equal to the occasion,

<P>and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said

<P>in the most engaging manner, "Mr. President and ladies--I beg pardon,

<P>gentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very

<P>humble servant of the club."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good!&nbsp; Good!" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old

<P>warming pan on which she leaned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My faithful friend and noble patron," continued Laurie with

<P>a wave of the hand, "who has so flatteringly presented me, is not

<P>to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight.&nbsp; I planned it,
and

<P>she only gave in after lots of teasing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself.&nbsp; You know I proposed

<P>the cupboard," broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke

<P>amazingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never mind what she says.&nbsp; I'm the wretch that did it, sir,"

<P>said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; "But

<P>on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself

<P>to the interest of this immortal club."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hear!&nbsp; Hear!" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan

<P>like a cymbal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go on, go on!" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President

<P>bowed benignly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude

<P>for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations

<P>between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge

<P>in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with

<P>padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the

<P>females, if I may be allowed the expression.&nbsp; It's the old martin

<P>house, but I've stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it

<P>will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time.&nbsp; Letters,

<P>manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each

<P>nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.&nbsp; Allow me
to

<P>present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my

<P>seat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the

<P>table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and

<P>it was some time before order could be restored.&nbsp; A long discussion

<P>followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her

<P>best.&nbsp; So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn

<P>till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the

<P>new member.&nbsp; No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller,
for

<P>a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have.

<P>He certainly did add `spirit' to the meetings, and `a tone' to the

<P>paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions

<P>were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic,

<P>but never sentimental.&nbsp; Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton,

<P>or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she

<P>thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished

<P>wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as

<P>through the real post office.&nbsp; Tragedies and cravats, poetry and

<P>pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread,

<P>rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies.&nbsp; The old gentleman

<P>liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles,

<P>mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was

<P>smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's

<P>care.&nbsp; How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming

<P>how many love letters that little post office would hold in the

<P>years to come.
