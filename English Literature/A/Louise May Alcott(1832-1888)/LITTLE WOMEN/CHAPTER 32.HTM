<P>"Jo, I'm anxious about Beth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the

<P>babies came."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits.

<P>I'm sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover

<P>what it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What makes you think so, Mother?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father

<P>as much as she used.&nbsp; I found her crying over the babies the

<P>other day.&nbsp; When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and

<P>now and then I see a look in her face that I don't understand.

<P>This isn't like Beth, and it worries me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you asked her about it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my

<P>questions or looked so distressed that I stopped.&nbsp; I never

<P>force my children's confidence, and I seldom have to wait

<P>for long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face

<P>opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude

<P>but Beth's, and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo

<P>said, "I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams,

<P>and have hopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why or

<P>being able to explain them.&nbsp; Why, Mother, Beth's eighteen, but

<P>we don't realize it, and treat her like a child, forgetting

<P>she's a woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So she is.&nbsp; Dear heart, how fast you do grow up," returned

<P>her mother with a sigh and a smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to

<P>all sorts of worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest,

<P>one by one.&nbsp; I promise never to hop very far, if that is any

<P>comfort to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a great comfort, Jo.&nbsp; I always feel strong when you

<P>are at home, now Meg is gone.&nbsp; Beth is too feeble and Amy too

<P>young to depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always

<P>ready."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there

<P>must always be one scrub in a family.&nbsp; Amy is splendid in fine

<P>works and I'm not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets

<P>are to be taken up, or half the family fall sick at once.

<P>Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but if anything is amiss

<P>at home, I'm your man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her

<P>tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else.&nbsp; Be

<P>very kind, and don't let her think anyone watches or talks

<P>about; her.&nbsp; If she only would get quite strong and cheerful

<P>again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Happy woman!&nbsp; I've got heaps."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, what are they?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine.

<P>They are not very wearing, so they'll keep."&nbsp; And Jo stitched away,

<P>with a wise nod which set her mother's heart at rest about her for

<P>the present at least.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched

<P>Beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled

<P>upon one which seemed to explain the change in her.&nbsp; A slight

<P>incident gave Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and

<P>lively fancy, loving heart did the rest.&nbsp; She was affecting

<P>to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she and Beth were

<P>alone together.&nbsp; Yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on her

<P>sister, who seemed unusually quiet.&nbsp; Sitting at the window, Beth's

<P>work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her

<P>hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull,

<P>autumnal landscape.&nbsp; Suddenly some one passed below, whistling

<P>like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, "All serene!

<P>Coming in tonight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the

<P>passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if

<P>to herself, "How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hum!" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the

<P>bright color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and

<P>presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge.&nbsp; Beth whisked

<P>it off, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that

<P>made her own eyes fill.&nbsp; Fearing to betray herself, she slipped

<P>away, murmuring something about needing more paper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!" she said, sitting down in

<P>her own room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she

<P>believed she had just made.&nbsp; "I never dreamed of such a thing.

<P>What will Mother say?&nbsp; I wonder if her..."&nbsp; there Jo stopped

<P>and turned scarlet with a sudden thought.&nbsp; "If he shouldn't love

<P>back again, how dreadful it would be.&nbsp; He must.&nbsp; I'll make
him!"

<P>And she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous-

<P>looking boy laughing at her from the wall.&nbsp; "Oh dear, we are

<P>growing up with a vengeance.&nbsp; Here's Meg married and a mamma,

<P>Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.&nbsp; I'm the only

<P>one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief."&nbsp; Jo thought

<P>intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then

<P>she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided

<P>nod at the face opposite, "No thank you, sir, you're very

<P>charming, but you've no more stability than a weathercock.&nbsp; So

<P>you needn't write touching notes and smile in that insinuating

<P>way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't have it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she

<P>did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new

<P>observations, which only confirmed her suspicion.&nbsp; Though

<P>Laurie flirted with Amy and joked with Jo, his manner to Beth

<P>had always been peculiarly kind and gentle, but so was everybody's.

<P>Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he cared more

<P>for her than for the others.&nbsp; Indeed, a general impression

<P>had prevailed in the family of late that `our boy' was getting

<P>fonder than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon

<P>the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it.

<P>If they had known the various tender passages which had been

<P>nipped in the bud, they would have had the immense satisfaction

<P>of saying, "I told you so."&nbsp; But Jo hated `philandering', and

<P>wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile ready at the

<P>least sign of impending danger.

<P>When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about

<P>once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent,

<P>did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in

<P>the alternations of hop, despair, and resignation, which were

<P>confided to her in their weekly conferences.&nbsp; But there came a

<P>time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted

<P>darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally

<P>in Byronic fits of gloom.&nbsp; Then he avoided the tender subject

<P>altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,

<P>and gave out that he was going to `dig', intending to graduate

<P>in a blaze of glory.&nbsp; This suited the young lady better than

<P>twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and

<P>eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed

<P>earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to

<P>real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be

<P>shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter

<P>were less manageable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was

<P>made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done

<P>before.&nbsp; If she had not got the new idea into her head, she

<P>would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was

<P>very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.&nbsp; But having given the

<P>rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great

<P>pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course

<P>or romance writing, did not come to the rescue.&nbsp; As usual Beth

<P>lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing

<P>her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly

<P>`spin', and he never disappointed her.&nbsp; But that evening Jo

<P>fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face

<P>beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with

<P>intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match,

<P>though the phrases, `caught off a tice', `stumped off his ground'',

<P>and `the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her as

<P>Sanskrit.&nbsp; She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,

<P>that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner,

<P>that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual,

<P>was a little absent--minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's

<P>feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who knows?&nbsp; Stranger things have happened," thought Jo,

<P>as she fussed about the room.&nbsp; "She will make quite an angel

<P>of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant

<P>for the dear, if they only love each other.&nbsp; I don't see how he

<P>can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of

<P>the way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to

<P>feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed.&nbsp; But

<P>where should she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine

<P>of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long,

<P>broad, well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might

<P>be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies,

<P>fished over the back, rode on the arms, and had menageries

<P>under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams,

<P>and listened to tender talk on it as young women.&nbsp; They all loved

<P>it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always been

<P>Jo's favorite lounging place.&nbsp; Among the many pillows that adorned

<P>the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly

<P>horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.&nbsp; This

<P>repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon

<P>of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with

<P>deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former

<P>days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it

<P>from the seat he most coveted next ot Jo in the sofa corner.&nbsp; If

<P>`the sausage' as the called it, stood on end, it was a sign that

<P>he might approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa,

<P>woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it!&nbsp; That evening

<P>Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat

<P>five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with

<P>both arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out

<P>before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, this is filling at the price."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No slang," snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.&nbsp; But it was

<P>too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor,

<P>it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come, Jo, don't be thorny.&nbsp; After studying himself to a

<P>skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get

<P>it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Beth will pet you.&nbsp; I'm busy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort

<P>of thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it.&nbsp; Have
you?

<P>Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom

<P>heard, but Jo quenched `her boy' by turning on him with a stern

<P>query, "How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not one, upon my word.&nbsp; She's engaged.&nbsp; Now then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances,

<P>sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two

<P>pins," continued Jo reprovingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't

<P>let me send them `flowers and things', so what can I do?&nbsp; My feelings

<P>need a` vent'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do

<P>flirt desperately, Teddy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'd give anything if I could answer, `So do you'.&nbsp; As I can't,

<P>I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little

<P>game, if all parties understand that it's only play."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done.

<P>I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as

<P>everybody else id doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo,

<P>forgetting to play mentor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too

<P>far.&nbsp; I suppose it's natural to some people to please without

<P>trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the

<P>wrong place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad you can't flirt.&nbsp; It's really refreshing to see a

<P>sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without

<P>making a fool of herself.&nbsp; Between ourselves, Jo, some of the

<P>girls I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them.

<P>They don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we

<P>fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I

<P>fancy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest,

<P>you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they,

<P>every bit.&nbsp; If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing

<P>you like their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame

<P>them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Much you know about it, ma'am," said Laurie in a superior tone.

<P>"We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if

<P>we did sometimes.&nbsp; The pretty, modest girls are never

<P>talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman.

<P>Bless your innocent soul!&nbsp; If you could be in my place

<P>for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle.

<P>Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls,

<P>I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Out upon you, fie upon you,

<P>Bold-faced jig!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict

<P>between Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind,

<P>and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of

<P>which fashionable society showed him many samples.&nbsp; Jo knew

<P>that `young Laurence' was regarded as a most eligible parti

<P>by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters,

<P>and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb

<P>of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing

<P>he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed

<P>to find that he still believed in modest girls.&nbsp; Returning

<P>suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her

<P>voice, "If you must have a `went', Teddy, go and devote

<P>yourself to one of the `pretty, modest girls' whom you do

<P>respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You really advise it?" And Laurie looked at her with

<P>an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through

<P>college, on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place

<P>meantime.&nbsp; You're not half good enough for--well, whoever

<P>the modest girl may be."&nbsp; And Jo looked a little queer likewise,

<P>for a name had almost escaped her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That I'm not!" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of

<P>humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently

<P>wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy on us, this will never do," thought Jo, adding

<P>aloud, "Go and sing to me.&nbsp; I'm dying for some music, and

<P>always like yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'd rather stay here, thank you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, you can't, there isn't room.&nbsp; Go and make yourself

<P>useful, since you are too big to be ornamental.&nbsp; I thought you

<P>hated to be tied to a woman's apron string?" retorted Jo,

<P>quoting certain rebellious words of his own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!" and Laurie

<P>gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you going?" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He fled at once, and the minute it was well, "Up with the

<P>bonnets of bonnie Dundee," she slipped away to return no more

<P>till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off

<P>when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside,

<P>with the anxious inquiry, "What is it, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you were asleep," sobbed Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is it the old pain, my precious?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it's a new one, but I can bear it."&nbsp; And Beth tried

<P>to check her tears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did

<P>the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can't, there is no cure."&nbsp; There Beth's voice gave

<P>way, and clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly

<P>that Jo was frightened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where is it?&nbsp; Shall I call Mother?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, don't call her, don't tell her.&nbsp; I shall be

<P>better soon.&nbsp; Lie down here and `poor' my head.&nbsp; I'll be

<P>quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will."

<P>Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across

<P>Beth's hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full

<P>and she longed to speak.&nbsp; But young as she was, Jo had learned

<P>that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must

<P>open naturally, so though she believed she knew the cause of

<P>Beth's new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, "Does

<P>anything trouble you, deary?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Jo," after a long pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"not now, not yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and

<P>Jo are always glad to hear and help you, if they can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know it.&nbsp; I'll tell you by-and-by."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is the pain better now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go to sleep, dear.&nbsp; I'll stay with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow

<P>Beth seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads

<P>nor hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a

<P>project for some days, she confided it to her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You asked me the other day what my wishes were.&nbsp; I'll

<P>tell you one of them, Marmee," she began, as they sat along

<P>together.&nbsp; "I want to go away somewhere this winter for a

<P>change."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, Jo?" And her mother looked up quickly, as if the

<P>words suggested a double meaning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, "I want

<P>something new.&nbsp; I feel restless and anxious to be seeing,

<P>doing, and learning more than I am.&nbsp; I brood too much over

<P>my own small affairs, and need stirring up, so as I can be

<P>spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way and try my

<P>wings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where will you hop?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To New York.&nbsp; I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is

<P>it.&nbsp; You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable

<P>young person to teach her children and sew.&nbsp; It's rather hard

<P>to find just the thing, but I think I should suit if I tried."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!"

<P>And Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is

<P>your friend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make

<P>things pleasant for me, I know.&nbsp; Her family is separate from

<P>the rest, and no one knows me there.&nbsp; Don't care if they do.

<P>It's honest work, and I'm not ashamed of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nor I.&nbsp; But your writing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All the better for the change.&nbsp; I shall see and hear new

<P>things, get new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there,

<P>I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for

<P>this sudden fancy?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, Mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May I know the others?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with

<P>sudden color in her cheeks.&nbsp; "It may be vain and wrong to

<P>say it, but--I'm afraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he

<P>begins to care for you?' And Mrs. March looked anxious as she

<P>put the question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mercy, no!&nbsp; I love the dear boy, as I always have, and

<P>am immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out

<P>of the question."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of that, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, please?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another.&nbsp; As

<P>friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow

<P>over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life.

<P>You are too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention

<P>hot tempers and strong wills, to get on happily together, in a

<P>relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well

<P>as love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it.

<P>I'm glad you think he is only beginning to care for me.&nbsp; It would

<P>trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love

<P>with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are sure of his feeling for you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she answered, with

<P>the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young

<P>girls wear when speaking of first lovers, "I'm afraid it is

<P>so, Mother.&nbsp; He hasn't said anything, but he looks a great deal.

<P>I think I had better go away before it comes to anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, "How

<P>Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she

<P>knew, and how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"AH, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the

<P>hope is the same in all--the desire to see their children happy.

<P>Meg is so, and I am content with her success.&nbsp; You I leave to

<P>enjoy your liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you

<P>find that there is something sweeter.&nbsp; Amy is my chief care

<P>now, but her good sense will help ;her.&nbsp; For Beth, I indulge

<P>no hopes except that she may be well.&nbsp; By the way, she seems

<P>brighter this last day or two.&nbsp; Have you spoken to her?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell

<P>me by-and-by.&nbsp; I said no more, for I think I know it," And

<P>Jo told her little story.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic

<P>a view of the case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion

<P>that for Laurie's sake Jo should go away for a time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled,

<P>then I'll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic.

<P>Beth must think I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't

<P>talk about Laurie to her.&nbsp; But she can pet and comfort him after

<P>I'm gone, and so cure him of this romantic notion.&nbsp; He's been

<P>through so many little trials of the sort, he's used to it, and

<P>will soon get over his lovelornity."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding

<P>fear that this `little trial' would be harder than the others,

<P>and that Laurie would not get over his `lovelornity' as easily

<P>as heretofore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed

<P>upon, for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to

<P>make a pleasant home for her.&nbsp; The teaching would render

<P>her independent, and such leisure as she got might be made

<P>profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society would

<P>be both useful and agreeable.&nbsp; Jo liked the prospect and was

<P>eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow

<P>for her restless nature and adventurous spirit.&nbsp; When all was

<P>settled, with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her

<P>surprise he took it very quietly.&nbsp; He had been graver than

<P>usual of late, but very pleasant, and when jokingly accused

<P>of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, "So I am,

<P>and I mean this one shall stay turned."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits

<P>should come on just then, and made her preparations with a

<P>lightened heart, for Beth seemed more cheerful, and hoped

<P>she was doing the best for all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One thing I leave in your especial care," she said, the

<P>night before she left.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You mean your papers?" asked Beth.

<P>"No, my boy.&nbsp; Be very good to him, won't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he'll

<P>miss you sadly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It won't hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your

<P>charge, to plague, pet, and keep in order."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll do my best, for your sake," promised Beth, wondering

<P>why Jo looked at her so queerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, "It

<P>won't do a bit of good, Jo.&nbsp; My eye is on you, so mind what you

<P>do, or I'll come and bring you home."
