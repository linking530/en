<P>At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world

<P>at Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place,

<P>for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs,

<P>is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive,

<P>lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and

<P>the hills.&nbsp; Many nations are represented, many languages spoken,
many

<P>costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant

<P>as a carnival.&nbsp; Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans,

<P>handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans,

<P>all drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticzing

<P>the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor

<P>Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.&nbsp; The equipages are
as

<P>varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the

<P>low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair

<P>of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from

<P>overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch

<P>behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked

<P>slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression

<P>of countenance.&nbsp; He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an

<P>Englishman, and had the independent air of an American--a combination

<P>which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly

<P>after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits, with

<P>rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange flowers in their

<P>buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his inches.

<P>There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the young man took

<P>little notice of them, except to glance now and then at some blonde

<P>girl in blue.&nbsp; Presently he strolled out of the promenade and

<P>stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and

<P>listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the

<P>beach toward Castle Hill.&nbsp; The quick trot of ponies feet made him

<P>look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a single

<P>young lady, came rapidly down the street.&nbsp; The lady was young,

<P>blonde, and dressed in blue.&nbsp; He stared a minute, then his whole

<P>face woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward

<P>to meet her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Laurie, is it really you?&nbsp; I thought you'd never come!"

<P>cried Amy, dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the

<P>great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's

<P>steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners

<P>of these `mad English'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas

<P>with you, and here I am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is your grandfather?&nbsp; When did you come?&nbsp; Where are you

<P>staying?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain.&nbsp; I called at your

<P>hotel, but you were out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin!&nbsp; Get

<P>in and we can talk at our ease.&nbsp; I was going for a drive and

<P>longing for company.&nbsp; Flo's saving up for tonight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What happens then, a ball?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A Christmas party at out hotel.&nbsp; There are many Americans

<P>there, and they give it in honor of the day.&nbsp; You'll go with us,

<P>of course?&nbsp; Aunt will be charmed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; Where now?" asked Laurie, leaning back and

<P>folding his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred

<P>to drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white

<P>ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to

<P>Castle Hill.&nbsp; The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks.

<P>Have you ever been there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now tell me all about yourself.&nbsp; The last I heard of you,

<P>your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin."

<P>"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris,

<P>where he has settled for the winter.&nbsp; He has friends there and

<P>finds plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we got on capitally."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's a sociable arrangement," said Amy, missing something

<P>in Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still,

<P>so we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble.&nbsp; I am often

<P>with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that

<P>someone is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings.&nbsp;
Dirty

<P>old hole, isn't it?" he added, with a look of disgust as they drove

<P>along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind.&nbsp; The river and the

<P>hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets

<P>are my delight.&nbsp; Now we shall have to wait for that procession
to

<P>pass.&nbsp; It's going to the Church of St. John."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests

<P>under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers,

<P>and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched

<P>him, and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was

<P>changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in

<P>the moody-looking man beside her.&nbsp; He was handsomer than ever and

<P>greatly improved, she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure

<P>at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritless--not sick,

<P>nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of

<P>prosperous life should have made him.&nbsp; She couldn't understand
it

<P>and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and

<P>touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the

<P>arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Que pensez-vous?" she said, airing her French, which had

<P>improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the

<P>result is charming," replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on

<P>his heart and an admiring look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did

<P>not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at

<P>home, when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and

<P>tole her she was `altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an

<P>approving pat on the head.&nbsp; She didn't like the new tone, for

<P>though not blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he's stay

<P>a boy," she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and

<P>discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving

<P>the reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the

<P>shady road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly

<P>as in June.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Beth is very poorly, Mother says.&nbsp; I often think I ought to

<P>go home, but they all say `stay'.&nbsp; So I do, for I shall never have

<P>another chance like this," said Amy, looking sober over one page.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think you are right, there.&nbsp; You could do nothing at home,

<P>and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and

<P>happy, and enjoying so much, my dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as

<P>he said that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart

<P>was lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly `my dear',

<P>seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not

<P>be alone in a strange land.&nbsp; Presently she laughed and showed him

<P>a small sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly

<P>erect upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, `Genius

<P>burns!'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket `to keep it

<P>from blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter

<P>Amy read him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents

<P>in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at

<P>night," said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort,

<P>and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely

<P>waiting to be fed.&nbsp; While Amy stood laughing on the bank above
him

<P>as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her

<P>as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see what

<P>changes time and absence had wrought.&nbsp; He found nothing to perplex

<P>or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few

<P>little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and

<P>graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something

<P>in dress and bearing which we call elegance.&nbsp; Always mature for
her

<P>age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation,

<P>which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was, but

<P>her old petulance now and then showed itself, her strong will still

<P>held its own, and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign

<P>polish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,

<P>but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried

<P>away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the

<P>sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh

<P>color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a

<P>prominent figure in the pleasant scene.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill,

<P>Amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and

<P>said, pointing here and there, "Do you remember the Cathedral and

<P>the Corso, the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the

<P>lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best

<P>of all, that speck far out to sea which they say ils Corsica?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I remember.&nbsp; It's not much changed," he answered without

<P>enthusiasm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!" said

<P>Amy, feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to

<P>see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made

<P>interesting in his sight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell

<P>me what you have been doing with yourself all this while," said

<P>Amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered

<P>all her questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved

<P>about the Continent and been to Greece.&nbsp; So after idling away an

<P>hour, they drove home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs.

<P>Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that

<P>night.&nbsp; Time and absence had done its work on both the young people.

<P>She had seen her old friend in a new light, not as `our boy', but as

<P>a handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural

<P>desire to find favor in his sight.&nbsp; Amy knew her good points, and

<P>made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to

<P>a poor and pretty woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself

<P>in them on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion

<P>of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes

<P>with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices,

<P>which were both inexpensive and effective.&nbsp; It must be confessed

<P>that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged

<P>in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies.

<P>But, dear heart, we all have out little weaknesses, and find it

<P>easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their

<P>comeliness, and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,"

<P>said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress,

<P>and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her

<P>white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect.

<P>Her hair she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the

<P>thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to

<P>make a fright of myself," she used to say, when advised to frizzle,

<P>puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion,

<P>Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and

<P>framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines.&nbsp; Remembering

<P>the painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with

<P>girlish satisfaction, and chassed down the room, admiring her

<P>aristocratic feet all by herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm,

<P>and the real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress.

<P>If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,"

<P>she said, surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in

<P>each hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and

<P>graceful as she glided away.&nbsp; She seldom ran--it did not suit her

<P>style, she thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was

<P>more appropriate than the sportive or piquante.&nbsp; She walked up
and

<P>down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged

<P>herself under the chandelier, which had a good effect upon her

<P>hair, then she thought better of it, and went away to the other

<P>end of the room, as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the

<P>first view a propitious one.&nbsp; It so happened that she could not

<P>have done a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she

<P>did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with

<P>her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the

<P>slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective

<P>as a well-placed statue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good evening, Diana!" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction

<P>she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good evening, Apollo!" she answered, smiling back at him,

<P>for he too looked unusually debonair, and the thought of

<P>entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man

<P>caused Amy to pity the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom

<P>of her heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here are your flowers.&nbsp; I arranged them myself, remembering

<P>that you didn't like what Hannah calls a `sot-bookay', said

<P>Laurie, handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she

<P>had long coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia's window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How kind you are!" she exclaimed gratefully.&nbsp; "If I'd

<P>known you were coming I'd have had something ready for you today,

<P>though not as pretty as this, I'm afraid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; It isn't what it should be, but you have improved
it,"

<P>he added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please don't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you liked that sort of thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your

<P>old bluntness better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of it," he answered, with a look of relief, then

<P>buttoned her gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight,

<P>just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The company assembled in the long salle a manger that

<P>evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.&nbsp; The

<P>hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had

<P>in Nice, and having no prejudice against titles, secured a few

<P>to add luster to their Christmas ball.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an

<P>hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother

<P>in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin.&nbsp; A Polish

<P>count, aged eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced

<P>him, `a fascinating dear', and a German Serene Something,

<P>having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what

<P>he might devour.&nbsp; Baron Rothschild's private secretary, a largenosed

<P>Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if

<P>his master's name crowned him with a golden halo.&nbsp; A stout

<P>Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for

<P>dancing, and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene

<P>with her little family of eight.&nbsp; Of course, there were many

<P>light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking

<P>English ditto, and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles,

<P>likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen

<P>who disported themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations

<P>lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced

<P>with their daughters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she

<P>`took the stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm.&nbsp; She

<P>knew she looked well, she loved to dance, she felt that her

<P>foot was on her native heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the

<P>delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first

<P>discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by

<P>virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.&nbsp; She did pity the

<P>Davis girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort,

<P>except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she

<P>bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed, which

<P>was good of her, as it permitted them to see her dress, and

<P>burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking

<P>friend might be.&nbsp; With the first burst of the band, Amy's

<P>color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the

<P>floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to

<P>know it.&nbsp; Therefore the shock she received can better be

<P>imagined than described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil

<P>tone, "Do you care to dance?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One usually does at a ball."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair

<P>his error as fast as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I meant the first dance.&nbsp; May I have the honor?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can give you one if I put off the Count.&nbsp; He dances

<P>devinely, but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend," said

<P>Amy, hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show

<P>Laurie that she was not to be trifled with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support .&nbsp; ..

<P>A daughter of the gods,

<P>Devinely tall, and most devinely fair,"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>was all the satisfaction she got, however.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The set in which they found themselves was composed of

<P>English, and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a

<P>cotillion, feeling all the while as if she could dance the

<P>tarantella with relish.&nbsp; Laurie resigned her to the `nice little

<P>boy', and went to do his duty to Flo, without securing Amy for

<P>the joys to come, which reprehensible want of forethought was

<P>properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself till

<P>supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence.

<P>She showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he

<P>strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a

<P>glorious polka redowa.&nbsp; But his polite regrets didn't impose

<P>upon her, and when she galloped away with the Count, she saw

<P>Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him

<P>for a long while, except a word now and then when she came to

<P>her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a

<P>moment's rest.&nbsp; Her anger had a good effect, however, for she

<P>hid it under a smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and

<P>brilliant.&nbsp; Laurie's eyes followed her with pleasure, for she

<P>neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit and

<P>grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.&nbsp; He

<P>very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of

<P>view, and before the evening was half over, had decided that

<P>`little Amy was going to make a very charming woman'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social

<P>season took possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made

<P>all faces shine, hearts happy, and heels light.&nbsp; The musicians

<P>fiddled, tooted, and banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody

<P>danced who could, and those who couldn't admired their

<P>neighbors with uncommon warmth.&nbsp; The air was dark with Davises,

<P>and many Jones gamboled like a flock of young giraffes.&nbsp; The

<P>golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with

<P>a dashing frenchwoman who carped the floor with her pink satin

<P>train.&nbsp; The serene Teuton found the supper table and was happy,

<P>eating steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the

<P>garcons by the ravages he committed.&nbsp; But the Emperor's friend

<P>covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether

<P>he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the

<P>figures bewildered him.&nbsp; The boyish abandon of that stout man

<P>was charming to behold, for though he `carried weight', he

<P>danced like an India-rubber ball.&nbsp; He ran, he flew, he pranced,

<P>his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails waved wildly,

<P>his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the music

<P>stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his

<P>fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm

<P>but more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself

<P>involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the

<P>white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged.

<P>When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, with assurances

<P>that he was `desolated to leave so early', she was ready to

<P>rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted

<P>affections find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves

<P>will thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise,

<P>when subjected to the enchantment of beauty, light, music, and

<P>motion.&nbsp; Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his

<P>seat, and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she

<P>said to herself, with a satisfied smile, "Ah, I thought that

<P>would do him good!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You look like Balzac's `FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLE-NENE',"

<P>he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee

<P>cup in the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My rouge won't come off." And Amy rubbed her brilliant

<P>cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity

<P>that made him laugh outright.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you call this stuff?" he asked, touching a fold

<P>of her dress that had blown over his knee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Illusion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good name for it.&nbsp; It's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's as old as the hills.&nbsp; You have seen it on dozens of

<P>girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?

<P>Stupide!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake,

<P>you see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"None of that, it is forbidden.&nbsp; I'd rather take coffee

<P>than compliments just now.&nbsp; No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate

<P>feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having `little Amy' order

<P>him about, for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an

<P>irrestible desire to trample on him, as girls have a delightful

<P>way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?" he asked with

<P>a quizzical look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As `this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would

<P>you kindly explain?" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he

<P>meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession, the--

<P>the--illusion--you know", laughed Laurie, breaking down and helping

<P>himself out of his quandary with the new word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely

<P>answered, "Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self.&nbsp; I

<P>study as well as play, and as for this"--with a little gesture

<P>toward her dress--"why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for

<P>nothing, and I am used to making the most of my poor little things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in

<P>good taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself

<P>both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most

<P>of opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with

<P>flowers.&nbsp; Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, now

<P>why he filled up her book with his own name, and devoted himself

<P>to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner,

<P>but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result

<P>of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously

<P>giving and receiving.
