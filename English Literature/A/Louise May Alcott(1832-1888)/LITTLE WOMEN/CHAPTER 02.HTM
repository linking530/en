<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning.

<P>No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she

<P>felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little

<P>sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies.&nbsp; Then

<P>she remembered her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under

<P>her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book.&nbsp; She knew

<P>it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best

<P>life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for

<P>any pilgrim going on a long journey.&nbsp; She woke Meg with a "Merry

<P>Christmas," and bade her see what was under her pillow.&nbsp; A green-

<P>covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few

<P>words written by their mother, which made their one present very

<P>precious in their eyes.&nbsp; Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage

<P>and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other

<P>blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the

<P>east grew rosy with the coming day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and

<P>pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters,

<P>especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her

<P>because her advice was so gently given.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Girls," said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head

<P>beside her to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond,

<P>"Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we

<P>must begin at once.&nbsp; We used to be faithful about it, but since

<P>Father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have

<P>neglected many things.&nbsp; You can do as you please, but I shall keep

<P>my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon

<P>as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then she opened her new book and began to read.&nbsp; Jo put her

<P>arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the

<P>quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How good Meg is!&nbsp; Come, Amy, let's do as they do.&nbsp; I'll

<P>help you with the hard words, and they'' explain things if we

<P>don't understand," whispered Beth, very much impressed by the

<P>pretty books and her sisters, example.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad mine is blue," said Amy.&nbsp; and then the rooms were

<P>very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter

<P>sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces

<P>with a Christmas greeting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where is Mother?" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to

<P>thank her for their gifts, half an hour later.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Goodness only knows.&nbsp; some poor creeter came a-beggin', and

<P>your ma went straight off to see what was needed.&nbsp; There never
was

<P>such a woman for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',"

<P>replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born,

<P>and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have

<P>everything ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were

<P>collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced

<P>at the proper time.&nbsp; "why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?"

<P>she added, as the little flask did not appear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a

<P>ribbon on it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the

<P>room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?&nbsp; Hannah washed

<P>and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself," said Beth,

<P>looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her

<P>such labor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless the child!&nbsp; She's gone and put `Mother' on them instead

<P>of `M.&nbsp; March'.&nbsp; How funny!" cried Jo, taking one up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Isn't that right?&nbsp; I thought it was better to do it so,

<P>because Meg's initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use

<P>these but Marmee," said Beth;, looking troubled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible

<P>too, for no one can ever mistake now.&nbsp; It will please her very
much,

<P>I know," said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's Mother.&nbsp; Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door

<P>slammed and steps sounded in the hall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw

<P>her sisters all waiting for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?"

<P>asked Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy

<P>had been out so early.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't laugh at me, Jo!&nbsp; I didn't mean anyone should know till

<P>the time came.&nbsp; I only meant to change the little bottle for a
big

<P>one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not

<P>to be selfish any more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced

<P>the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little

<P>effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo

<P>pronounced her `a trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked

<P>her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking

<P>about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed

<P>it the minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest

<P>now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa,

<P>and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Merry Christmas, Marmee!&nbsp; Many of them!&nbsp; Thank you for our

<P>books.&nbsp; We read some, and mean to every day," they all cried in

<P>chorus.

<P>"Merry Christmas, little daughters!&nbsp; I'm glad you began at

<P>once, and hope you will keep on.&nbsp; But I want to say one word

<P>before we sit down.&nbsp; Not far away from here lies a poor woman

<P>with a little newborn baby.&nbsp; Six children are huddled into one
bed

<P>to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.&nbsp; There is nothing
to

<P>eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were

<P>suffering hunger and cold.&nbsp; My girls, will you give them your

<P>breakfast as a Christmas present?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour,

<P>and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed

<P>impetuously, "I'm so glad you came before we began!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?"

<P>asked Beth eagerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall take the cream and the muffings," added Amy, heroically

<P>giving up the article she most liked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread

<P>into one big plate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you'd do it," said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied.

<P>"You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread

<P>and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were soon ready, and the procession set out.&nbsp; Fortunately

<P>it was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw

<P>them, and no one laughed at the queer party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no

<P>fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group

<P>of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to

<P>keep warm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls

<P>went in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ach, mein Gott!&nbsp; It is good angels come to us!" said the poor

<P>woman, crying for joy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Funny angels in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them to

<P>laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been

<P>at work there.&nbsp; Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and

<P>stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.&nbsp; Mrs.

<P>March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises

<P>of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had

<P>been her own.&nbsp; The girls meantime spread the table, set the children

<P>round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing,

<P>talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Das ist gut!"&nbsp; "Die Engel-kinder!" cried the poor things as

<P>they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.

<P>The girls had never been called angel children before, and

<P>thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered

<P>a `Sancho' ever since she was born.&nbsp; That was a very happy breakfast,

<P>though they didn't get any of it.&nbsp; And when they went away,

<P>leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city

<P>four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away

<P>their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk

<P>on Christmas morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I

<P>like it," said Meg, as they set out their presents while their

<P>mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of

<P>love done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of

<P>red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which

<P>stood in the middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's coming!&nbsp; Strike up, Beth!&nbsp; Open the door, Amy!&nbsp;
Three

<P>cheers for Marmee!" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to

<P>conduct Mother to the seat of honor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth played her gayest march, amy threw open the door, and

<P>Meg enacted escort with great dignity.&nbsp; Mrs. March was both

<P>surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she

<P>examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied

<P>them.&nbsp; The slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped

<P>into her pocket, well scented with Amy's cologne, the rose was

<P>fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect

<P>fit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining,

<P>in the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so

<P>pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and

<P>then all fell to work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that

<P>the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening

<P>festivities.&nbsp; Being still too young to go often to the theater,

<P>and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private

<P>performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being

<P>the mother of invention, made whatever they needed.&nbsp; Very clever

<P>were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps

<P>made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper,

<P>gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from

<P>a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond

<P>shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of preserve pots were

<P>cut out.&nbsp; The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her

<P>heart's content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet

<P>leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an

<P>actor.&nbsp; These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used

<P>by an artist for some picture, were Jo's chief treasures and

<P>appeared on all occasions.&nbsp; The smallness of the company made it

<P>necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts

<P>apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work

<P>they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in

<P>and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.&nbsp; It

<P>was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and

<P>employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely,

<P>or spent in less profitable society.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which

<P>was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz

<P>curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy.&nbsp; There was a

<P>good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle

<P>of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to

<P>get hysterical in the excitement of the moment.&nbsp; Presently a bell

<P>sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the OPERATIC TRAGEDY began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A gloomy wood," according to the one playbill, was represented

<P>by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a

<P>cave in the distance.&nbsp; This cave was made with a clothes horse

<P>for a roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in

<P>full blast, with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over

<P>it.&nbsp; The stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine

<P>effect, especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the

<P>witch took off the cover.&nbsp; A moment was allowed for the first

<P>thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a

<P>clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black beard,

<P>mysterious cloak, and the boots.&nbsp; After pacing to and fro in much

<P>agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild

<P>strain, singing of his hatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara,

<P>and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other.

<P>The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an occasional shout when

<P>his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the audience

<P>applauded the moment he paused for breath.&nbsp; bowing with the air

<P>of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and

<P>ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, "What ho, minion!

<P>I need thee!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face,

<P>a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her

<P>cloak.&nbsp; Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one

<P>destroy Roderigo.&nbsp; Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised

<P>both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the

<P>love philter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hither, hither, from thy home,

<P>Airy sprite, I bid thee come!

<P>Born of roses, fed on dew,

<P>Charms and potions canst thou brew?

<P>Bring me here, with elfin speed,

<P>The fragrant philter which I need.

<P>Make it sweet and swift and strong,

<P>Spirit, answer now my song!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the

<P>cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering

<P>wings, golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head.&nbsp; Waving

<P>a wand, it sang...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hither I come,

<P>From my airy home,

<P>Afar in the silver moon.

<P>Take the magic spell,

<P>And use it well,

<P>Or its power will vanish soon!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the

<P>spirit vanished.&nbsp; Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,

<P>not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and,

<P>having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared

<P>with a mocking laugh.&nbsp; Having warbled his thanks and put the potions

<P>in his boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that

<P>as he had killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed

<P>him, and intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.&nbsp;
Then

<P>the curtain fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while

<P>discussing the merits of the play.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again,

<P>but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery

<P>had been got up, no one murmured at the delay.&nbsp; It was truly superb.

<P>A tower rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a

<P>lamp burning in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in

<P>a lovely blue and silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.&nbsp; He came
in

<P>gorgeous array, with plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a

<P>guitar, and the boots, of course.&nbsp; Kneeling at the foot of the
tower,

<P>he sang a serenade in melting tones.&nbsp; Zara replied and, after a

<P>musical dialogue, consented to fly.&nbsp; Then came the grand effect
of

<P>the play.&nbsp; Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to
it,

<P>threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend.&nbsp; Timidly she crept

<P>from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was

<P>about to leap gracfully down when "Alas!&nbsp; Alas for Zara!" she

<P>forgot her train.&nbsp; It caught in the window, the tower tottered,

<P>leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers

<P>in the ruins.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly

<P>from the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, "I told you

<P>so!&nbsp; I told you so!"&nbsp; With wonderful presence of mind, Don
Pedro,

<P>the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty

<P>aside...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't laugh!&nbsp; Act as if it was all right!" and, ordering

<P>Roderigo up, banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn.

<P>Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him,

<P>Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir.&nbsp; This

<P>dauntless example fired Zara.&nbsp; She also defied her sire, and he

<P>ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle.&nbsp; A stout

<P>little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very

<P>much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to

<P>have made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having

<P>come to free the lovers and finish Hugo.&nbsp; She hears him coming
and

<P>hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the

<P>the timid little servant, "Bear them to the captives in their cells,

<P>and tell them I shall come anon."&nbsp; The servant takes Hugo aside
to

<P>tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which

<P>are harmless.&nbsp; Ferdinando, the `minion', carries them away, and

<P>Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo.

<P>Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits,

<P>and after a good deal of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies,

<P>while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite

<P>power and melody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might

<P>have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red

<P>hair rather marred the effect of the villain's death.&nbsp; He was called

<P>before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar,

<P>whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the

<P>performance put together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of

<P>stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him.

<P>Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his

<P>window, informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can

<P>save her if he will.&nbsp; A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door,

<P>and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away

<P>to find and rescue his lady love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro.

<P>He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and

<P>after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in

<P>and demands her hand.&nbsp; Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich.

<P>They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and

<P>Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid

<P>servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously

<P>disappeared.&nbsp; The latter informs the party that she bequeths

<P>untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if

<P>he doesn't make them happy.&nbsp; The bag is opened, and several quarts
of

<P>tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with

<P>the glitter.&nbsp; This entirely softens the stern sire.&nbsp; He consents

<P>without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus, and the curtain falls

<P>upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing in attitudes

<P>of the most romantic grace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check,

<P>for the cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut

<P>up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience.&nbsp; Roderigo and Don

<P>Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many

<P>were speechless with laughter.&nbsp; the excitement had hardly subsided

<P>when Hannah appeared, with "Mrs. March's compliments, and would the

<P>ladies walk down to supper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the

<P>table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.&nbsp; It was

<P>like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine

<P>as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty.&nbsp; There
was

<P>ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and

<P>fruit and distracting french bonbons and, in the middle of the

<P>table, four great bouquets of hot house flowers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the

<P>table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it

<P>immensely.

<P>"Is it fairies?" asked Amy.

<P>"Santa Claus," said Beth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother did it." And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her

<P>gray beard and white eyebrows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper," cried Jo, with

<P>a sudden inspiration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All wrong.&nbsp; Old Mr. Laurence sent it," replied Mrs. March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a

<P>thing into his head?&nbsp; We don't know him!' exclaimed Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party.

<P>He is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.&nbsp; He knew my father

<P>years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he

<P>hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my

<P>children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day.&nbsp; I

<P>could not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make

<P>up for the bread-and-milk breakfast."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That boy; put it into his head, I know he did!&nbsp; He's a capital

<P>fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted.&nbsp; He looks as if he'd

<P>like to know us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let

<P>me speak to him when we pass," said Jo, as the plates went round,

<P>and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't

<P>you?" asked one of the girls.&nbsp; "My mother knows old Mr. Laurence,

<P>but says he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors.

<P>He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with

<P>his tutor, and makes him study very hard.&nbsp; We invited him to our

<P>party, but he didn't come.&nbsp; Mother says he's very nice, though
he

<P>never speaks to us girls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we

<P>talked over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about

<P>cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.&nbsp; I

<P>mean to know him some day, for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,"

<P>said Jo decidedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so

<P>I've no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes.

<P>He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if

<P>I had been sure what was going on upstairs.&nbsp; He looked so wistful

<P>as he went away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of

<P>his own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a mercy you didn't , Mother!" laughed Jo, looking at

<P>her boots.&nbsp; "But we'll have another play sometime that he can

<P>see.&nbsp; Perhaps he'll help act.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be jolly?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never had such a fine bouquet before!&nbsp; How pretty it is!"

<P>And Meg examined her flowers with great interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are lovely.&nbsp; But Beth's roses are sweeter to me," said

<P>Mrs. March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, "I wish I

<P>could send my bunch to Father.&nbsp; I'm afraid he isn't having such

<P>a merry Christmas as we are."
