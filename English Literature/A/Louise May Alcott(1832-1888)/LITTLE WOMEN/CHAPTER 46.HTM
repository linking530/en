<P>While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet

<P>carpets, as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful

<P>future, Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different

<P>sort, along muddy roads and sodden fields.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know

<P>why I should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor

<P>on his way out," said Jo to herself, after two or three

<P>encounters, for though there were two paths to Meg's whichever

<P>one she took she was sure to meet him., either going or returning.

<P>He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her

<P>until quite close, when he would look as if his short-sighted

<P>eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that

<P>moment.&nbsp; Then, if she was going to Meg's he always had something

<P>for the babies.&nbsp; If her face was turned homeward, he had merely

<P>strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless

<P>they were tired of his frequent calls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him

<P>civilly, and invite him in?&nbsp; If she was tired of his visits, she

<P>concealed her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that

<P>there should be coffee for supper, "as Friedrich--I mean Mr.

<P>Bhaer--doesn't like tea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was

<P>going on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind

<P>to the changes in Jo's face.&nbsp; They never asked why she sang about

<P>her work, did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming

<P>with her evening exercise.&nbsp; And no one seemed to have the slightest

<P>suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with

<P>the father, was giving the daughter lessons in love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but

<P>sternly tried to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led

<P>a somewhat agitated life.&nbsp; She was mortally afraid of being laughed

<P>at for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of

<P>independence.&nbsp; Laurie was her especial dread, but thanks to the

<P>new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called

<P>Mr. Bhaer `a capital old fellow' in public, never alluded, in the

<P>remotest manner, to Jo's improved appearance, or expressed the

<P>least surprise at seeing the Professor's hat on the Marches' table

<P>nearly every evening.&nbsp; But he exulted in private and longed for

<P>the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate, with a

<P>bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like

<P>regularity.&nbsp; Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made

<P>no sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and

<P>Jo to become pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance--very

<P>cross.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came.

<P>It's nothing tome, of course, but I should think he would have

<P>come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman," she said to herself,

<P>with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for

<P>the customary walk one dull afternoon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear.&nbsp; It looks like

<P>rain," said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet,

<P>but not alluding to the fact.

<P>"Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town?&nbsp; I've got to

<P>run in and get some paper," returned Jo, pulling out the bow

<P>under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at

<P>her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine

<P>needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon.&nbsp; Have you got

<P>your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe so," answered Jo absently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea.

<P>I quite long to see the dear man," added Mrs. March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother,

<P>and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite

<P>of her heartache, "How good she is to me! What do girls do who

<P>haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses,

<P>banks, and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate,

<P>but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a

<P>single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining

<P>engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in

<P>another, with most unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels,

<P>being half-smothered by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously

<P>by busy men who looked as if they wondered `how the deuce

<P>she got there'.&nbsp; A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts

<P>from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons.&nbsp; For the drops continued
to

<P>fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though

<P>it was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet.&nbsp; Now she

<P>remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten to take

<P>in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing, and nothing

<P>could be done but borrow one or submit to to a drenching.&nbsp; She

<P>looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already

<P>flecked with black, forward along the muddy street, then one

<P>long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with

<P>`Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co.' over the door, and said to herself,

<P>with a sternly reproachful air...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my

<P>best things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the

<P>Professor?&nbsp; Jo, I'm ashamed of you!&nbsp; No, you shall not go
there

<P>to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends.

<P>You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and if

<P>you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it's no more than

<P>you deserve.&nbsp; Now then!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she

<P>narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated

<P>herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said,

<P>"I beg pardon, ma'am," and looked mortally offended.&nbsp; Somewhat

<P>daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over

<P>the devoted ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on,

<P>with increasing dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of

<P>umbrellas overhead.&nbsp; The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue

<P>one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted

<P>her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely

<P>under many horse noses, and so fast through much mus.&nbsp; What do

<P>you down here, my friend?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm shopping."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on

<P>one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other,

<P>but her only said politely, "You haf no umbrella.&nbsp; May I go also,

<P>and take for you the bundles?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, thank you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what

<P>he thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found

<P>herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if

<P>the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that

<P>the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman

<P>was paddling through the wet that day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We thought you had gone," said Jo hastily, for she knew he

<P>was looking at her.&nbsp; Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face,

<P>and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those

<P>who haf been so heavenly kind tome?" he asked so reproachfully

<P>that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and

<P>answered heartily...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I didn't.&nbsp; I knew you were busy about your own affairs,

<P>but we rather missed you, Father and Mother especially."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm always glad to see you, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather

<P>cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill

<P>the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thank you, and come one more time before I go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are going, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haf no longer any business here, it is done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Successfully, I hope?" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment

<P>was in that short reply of his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which

<P>I can make my bread and gif my Junglings much help."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me, please!&nbsp; I like to know all about the--the boys,"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>said Jo eagerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is so kind, I gladly tell you.&nbsp; My friends find for me

<P>a place in a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough

<P>to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil.&nbsp; For this I should be

<P>grateful, should I not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed you should.&nbsp; How splendid it will be to have you

<P>doing what you like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!"

<P>cried Jo, clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction

<P>she could not help betraying.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at

<P>the West."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So far away!"&nbsp; And Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if

<P>it didn't matter now what became of her clothes or herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not

<P>learned to read women yet.&nbsp; He flattered himself that he knew

<P>Jo pretty well, and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions

<P>of voice, face, and manner, which she showed him in rapid

<P>succession that day, for she was in half a dozen different

<P>moods in the course of half an hour.&nbsp; When she met him she looked

<P>surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she

<P>had come for that express purpose.&nbsp; When he offered her his arm,

<P>she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but when

<P>he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply

<P>that despair fell upon him.&nbsp; On learning his good fortune she

<P>almost clapped her hands.&nbsp; Was the joy all for the boys?&nbsp;
Then

<P>on hearing his destination, she said, "So far away!" in a tone

<P>of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the

<P>next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like one

<P>entirely absorbed in the matter...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's the place for my errands.&nbsp; Will you come in? It

<P>won't take long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities,

<P>and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness

<P>and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business.

<P>But owing to the flutter she was in, everything went amiss.

<P>She upset the tray of needles, forgot the silesia was to be

<P>`twilled' till it was cut off, gave the wrong change, and

<P>covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon

<P>at the calico counter.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush

<P>and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to

<P>subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions,

<P>women, like dreams, go by contraries.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with

<P>a more cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if

<P>he rather enjoyed it on the whole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the

<P>babies, and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last

<P>call at your so pleasant home?" he asked, stopping before a

<P>window full of fruit and flowers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What will we buy?" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of

<P>his speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation

<P>of delight as they went in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May they haf oranges and figs?" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a

<P>paternal air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They eat them when they can get them."

<P>"Do you care for nuts?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Like a squirrel."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hamburg grapes.&nbsp; Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in

<P>those?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why

<P>he didn't buy a frail of dated, a cask of raisins, and a bag of

<P>almonds, and be done with it?&nbsp; Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her

<P>purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying

<P>several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty

<P>jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn.&nbsp; Then

<P>distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the

<P>flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled

<P>on again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you," began the

<P>Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir." And Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was

<P>afraid he would hear it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short

<P>a time remains to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir."&nbsp; And Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with

<P>the sudden squeeze she gave it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid

<P>to go alone.&nbsp; Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir." And JO felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if

<P>she had stepped into a refrigerator.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick,

<P>and the husband is such a care.&nbsp; Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl

<P>would be a friendly thing to take the little mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.&nbsp; I'm going very fast,

<P>and he's getting dearer every minute," added Jo to herself, then

<P>with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy

<P>that was pleasant to behold.

<P>Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for

<P>Tina, and then ordered out the shawls.&nbsp; The clerk, being a married

<P>man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared

<P>to be shopping for their family.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your lady may prefer this.&nbsp; It's a superior article, a most

<P>desirable color, quite chaste and genteel," he said, shaking out

<P>a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?" she asked, turning her

<P>back to him, and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding

<P>her face.

<P>"Excellently well, we will haf it," answered the Professor,

<P>smiling to himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to

<P>rummage the counters like a confirmed bargain-hunter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now shall we go home?" he asked, as if the words were

<P>very pleasant to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it's late, and I'm so tired." Jo's voice was more

<P>pathetic than she knew.&nbsp; For now the sun seemed to have gone

<P>in as suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy and

<P>miserable again, and for the first time she discovered that her

<P>feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder

<P>than the former, fuller of pain than the latter.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer

<P>was going away, he only cared for her as a friend, it was all

<P>a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.&nbsp; With this

<P>idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such

<P>a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were

<P>badly damaged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is not our omniboos," said the Professor, waving the

<P>loaded vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little

<P>flowers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I didn't see the name distinctly.&nbsp; Never

<P>mind, I can walk.&nbsp; I'm used to plodding in the mud," returned Jo,

<P>winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly

<P>wipe her eyes.

<P>Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her

<P>head away.&nbsp; The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly

<P>stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, "Heart's

<P>dearest, why do you cry?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would

<P>have said she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told

<P>any other feminine fib proper to the occasion.&nbsp; Instead of which,

<P>that undignified creature answered, with an irrepressible sob,

<P>"Because you are going away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing

<P>to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles,

<P>"Jo, I haf nothing but much love to gif you.&nbsp; I came to see if

<P>you could care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something

<P>more than a friend.&nbsp; Am I?&nbsp; Can you make a little place in
your

<P>heart for old Fritz?" he added, all in one breath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes!" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she

<P>folded both hands over his are, and looked up at him with an

<P>expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk

<P>through life beside him, even though she had no better shelter

<P>than the old umbrella, if he carried it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if

<P>he had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his

<P>knees, on account of the mud.&nbsp; Neither could he offer Jo his

<P>hand, except figuratively, for both were full.&nbsp; Much less could

<P>he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street, though

<P>he was near it.&nbsp; So the only way in which he could express his

<P>rapture was to look at her, with an expression which glorified

<P>his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be

<P>little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard.&nbsp; If

<P>he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done

<P>it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a

<P>deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and

<P>her bonnet a ruin.&nbsp; Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the

<P>most beautiful woman living, and she found him more `Jove-like"

<P>than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little

<P>rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the

<P>umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed

<P>mending.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics,

<P>for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled

<P>leisurely along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog.&nbsp; Little

<P>they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the

<P>happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the magical

<P>moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain,

<P>wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven.

<P>The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the

<P>world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.&nbsp; While

<P>Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been

<P>there, and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other

<P>lot.&nbsp; Of course, she was the first to speak--intelligibly, I

<P>mean, for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous

<P>"Oh, yes!" were not of a coherent or reportable character.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Friedrich, why didn't you..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since

<P>Minna died!" cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard

<P>her with grateful delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won't unless

<P>you like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Like it?&nbsp; It is more sweet to me than I can tell.&nbsp; Say `thou',

<P>also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Isn't `thou' a little sentimental?" asked Jo, privately thinking

<P>it a lovely monosyllable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sentimental? Yes.&nbsp; Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment,

<P>and keep ourselves young mit it.&nbsp; Your English `you' is so cold,
say

<P>`thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me," pleaded Mr. Bhaer,

<P>more like a romantic student than a grave professor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?" asked

<P>Jo bashfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly

<P>will, because thou must take care of it hereafter.&nbsp; See, then,
my

<P>Jo--ah, the dear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something

<P>the day I said goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome

<P>friend was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not.&nbsp; Wouldst thou

<P>have said `Yes', then, if I had spoken?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't know.&nbsp; I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just
then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Prut!&nbsp; That I do not believe.&nbsp; It was asleep till the fairy
prince

<P>came through the wood, and waked it up.&nbsp; Ah, well, `Die erste Liebe

<P>ist die beste', but that I should not expect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I

<P>never had another.&nbsp; Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his

<P>little fancy," said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good!&nbsp; Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest

<P>me all.&nbsp; I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt

<P>find , Professorin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like that," cried Jo, delighted with her new name.&nbsp; "Now

<P>tell me what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This." And Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his

<P>waistcoat pocket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of

<P>her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which

<P>accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How could that bring you?" she asked, wondering what he

<P>meant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I found it by chance.&nbsp; I knew it by the names and the

<P>initials, and in it there was one little verse that seemed to

<P>call me.&nbsp; Read and find him.&nbsp; I will see that you go not in

<P>the wet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>IN THE GARRET

<P>Four little chests all in a row,

<P>Dim with dust, and worn by time,

<P>All fashioned and filled, long ago,

<P>By children now in their prime.

<P>Four little keys hung side by side,

<P>With faded ribbons, brave and gay

<P>When fastened there, with childish pride,

<P>Long ago, on a rainy day.

<P>Four little names, one on each lid,

<P>Carved out by a boyish hand,

<P>And underneath there lieth hid

<P>Histories of the happpy band

<P>Once playing here, and pausing oft

<P>To hear the sweet refrain,

<P>That came and went on the roof aloft,

<P>In the falling summer rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Meg" on the first lid, smooth and fair.

<P>I look in with loving eyes,

<P>For folded here, with well-known care,

<P>A goodly gathering lies,

<P>The record of a peaceful life--

<P>Gifts to gentle child and girl,

<P>A bridal gown, lines to a wife,

<P>A tiny shoe, a baby curl.

<P>No toys in this first chest remain,

<P>For all are carried away,

<P>In their old age, to join again

<P>In another small Meg's play.

<P>Ah, happy mother!&nbsp; Well I know

<P>You hear, like a sweet refrain,

<P>Lullabies ever soft and low

<P>In the falling summer rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo" on the next lid, scratched and worn,

<P>And within a motley store

<P>Of headless, dolls, of schoolbooks torn,

<P>Birds and beasts that speak no more,

<P>Spoils brought home from the fairy ground

<P>Only trod by youthful feet,

<P>Dreams of a future never found,

<P>Memories of a past still sweet,

<P>Half-writ poems, stories wild,

<P>April letters, warm and cold,

<P>Diaries of a wilful child,

<P>Hints of a woman early old,

<P>A woman in a lonely home,

<P>Hearing, like a sad refrain--

<P>"Be worthy, love, and love will come,"

<P>In the falling summer rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Beth!&nbsp; the dust is always swept

<P>From the lid that bears your name,

<P>As if by loving eyes that wept,

<P>By careful hands that often came.

<P>Death cannonized for us one saint,

<P>Ever less human than divine,

<P>And still we lay, with tender plaint,

<P>Relics in this household shrine--

<P>The silver bell, so seldom rung,

<P>The little cap which last she wore,

<P>The fair, dead Catherine that hung

<P>By angels borne above her door.

<P>The songs she sang, without lament,

<P>In her prison-house of pain,

<P>Forever are they sweetly blent

<P>With the falling summer rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon the last lid's polished field--

<P>Legend now both fair and true

<P>A gallant knight bears on his shield,

<P>"Amy" in letters gold and blue.

<P>Within lie snoods that bound her hair,

<P>Slippers that have danced their last,

<P>Faded flowers laid by with care,

<P>Fans whose airy toils are past,

<P>Gay valentines, all ardent flames,

<P>Trifles that have borne their part

<P>In girlish hopes and fears and shames,

<P>The record of a maiden heart

<P>Now learning fairer, truer spells,

<P>Hearing, like a blithe refrain,

<P>The silver sound of bridal bells

<P>In the falling summer rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Four little chests all in a row,

<P>Dim with dust, and worn by time,

<P>Four women, taught by weal and woe

<P>To love and labor in their prime.

<P>Four sisters, parted for an hour,

<P>None lost, one only gone before,

<P>Made by love's immortal power,

<P>Nearest and dearest evermore.

<P>Oh, when these hidden stores of ours

<P>Lie open to the Father's sight,

<P>May they be rich in golden hours,

<P>Deeds that show fairer for the light,

<P>Lives whose brave music long shall ring,

<P>Like a spirit-stirring strain,

<P>Souls that shall gladly soar and sing

<P>In the long sunshine after rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day

<P>when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag.&nbsp; I never

<P>thought it would go where it could tell tales," said Jo, tearing

<P>up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let it go, it has done it's duty, and I will haf a fresh one

<P>when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little

<P>secrets," said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments

<P>fly away on the wind.&nbsp; "Yes," he added earnestly, "I read that,

<P>and I think to myself, She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would

<P>find comfort in true love.&nbsp; I haf a heart full, full for her.&nbsp;
Shall

<P>I not go and say, "If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what

<P>I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's name?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one

<P>precious thing I needed," whispered Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was

<P>your welcome to me.&nbsp; But soon I began to hope, and then I said,

<P>`I will haf her if I die for it,' and so I will!" cried Mr. Bhaer,

<P>with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were

<P>barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,

<P>though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What made you stay away so long?" she asked presently, finding

<P>it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful

<P>answers that she could not keep silent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you

<P>from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to

<P>gif you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work.&nbsp; How could I
ask

<P>you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune

<P>but a little learning?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad you are poor.&nbsp; I couldn't bear a rich husband,"

<P>said Jo decidedly, adding in a softer tone, "Don't fear poverty.

<P>I've known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working

<P>for those I love, and don't call yourself old--forty is the prime

<P>of life.&nbsp; I couldn't help loving you if you were seventy!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Professor found that so touching that he would have been

<P>glad of his handkerchief, if he could have got at it.&nbsp; As her

<P>couldn't, Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she

<P>took away a bundle or two...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my

<P>sphere now, for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying

<P>tears and bearing burdens.&nbsp; I'm to carry my share, Friedrich,

<P>and help to earn the home.&nbsp; Make up your mind to that, or I'll

<P>never go," she added resolutely, as he tried to reclaim his load.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We shall see.&nbsp; Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo?

<P>I must go away and do my work alone.&nbsp; I must help my boys first,

<P>because, even for you, I may not break my word to Minna.&nbsp; Can

<P>you forgif that, and be happy while we hope and wait?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes

<P>all the rest easy to bear.&nbsp; I have my duty, also, and my work.

<P>I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so

<P>there's no need of hurry or impatience.&nbsp; You can do your part

<P>out West, I can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the

<P>best, and leaving the future to be as God wills."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing

<P>to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands," cried the

<P>Professor, quite overcome.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said

<P>that as they stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into

<P>his, whispering tenderly, "Not empty now," and stooping down,

<P>kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella.&nbsp; It was dreadful, but

<P>she would have done it if the flock of draggle-tailed sparrows

<P>on the hedge had been human beings, for she was very far gone

<P>indeed, and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness.

<P>Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the crowning

<P>moment of both their lives, when, turning from the night and

<P>storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace

<P>waiting to receive them, with a glad "Welcome home!"&nbsp; Jo led her

<P>lover in, and shut the door.
