<P>Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could

<P>attend to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of

<P>unlocking the little door and distributing the mail.&nbsp; One July

<P>day she came in with her hands full, and went about the house

<P>leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's your posy, Mother!&nbsp; Laurie never forgets that," she

<P>said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in `Marmee's

<P>corner', and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove," continued Beth,

<P>delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother,

<P>stitching wristbands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one," said

<P>Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove.&nbsp; "Didn't you drop the

<P>other in the garden?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hate to have odd gloves!&nbsp; Never mind, the other may be

<P>found.&nbsp; My letter is only a translation of the German song I

<P>wanted.&nbsp; I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's

<P>writing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in

<P>her gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her

<P>forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable,

<P>full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her

<P>mother's mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew

<P>and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent

<P>and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and

<P>was satisfied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat,

<P>which covered the whole post office and stuck outside," said

<P>Beth, laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a sly fellow Laurie is!&nbsp; I said I wished bigger hats

<P>were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day.&nbsp; He said,

<P>`Why mind the fashion?&nbsp; Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I

<P>said I would if I had one, and he has sent me this to try me.&nbsp;
I'll

<P>wear it for fun, and show him I don't care for the fashion."&nbsp; And

<P>hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her

<P>letters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill,

<P>for it said to her...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Dear:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction

<P>I watch your efforts to control your temper.&nbsp; You say nothing

<P>about your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps,

<P>that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask,

<P>if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook.&nbsp; I, too,

<P>have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of

<P>your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit.&nbsp; Go on, dear,

<P>patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes

<P>more tenderly with you than your loving...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mother
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That does me good!&nbsp; That's worth millions of money and

<P>pecks of praise.&nbsp; Oh, Marmee, I do try!&nbsp; I will keep on trying,

<P>and not get tired, since I have you to help me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with

<P>a few happy tears.&nbsp; for she had thought that no one saw and

<P>appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly

<P>precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the

<P>person whose commendation she most valued.&nbsp; Feeling stronger than

<P>ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her

<P>frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and

<P>proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or

<P>bad news.&nbsp; In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear Jo,

<P>What ho!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow

<P>and I want to have a jolly time.&nbsp; If it's fine, I'm going to pitch

<P>my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and

<P>croquet--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts

<P>of larks.&nbsp; They are nice people, and like such things.&nbsp; Brooke
will

<P>go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for

<P>the girls.&nbsp; I want you all to come, can't let Beth off at any price,

<P>and nobody shall worry her.&nbsp; Don't bother about rations, I'll see

<P>to that and everything else, only do come, there's a good fellow!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a tearing hurry,

<P>Yours ever, Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here's richness!" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course we can go, Mother?&nbsp; It will be such a help to

<P>Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children

<P>be useful in some way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.&nbsp; Do you

<P>know anything about them, Jo?" asked Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only that there are four of them.&nbsp; Kate is older than you,

<P>Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who

<P>is nine or ten.&nbsp; Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.&nbsp;
I

<P>fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her,

<P>that he didn't admire Kate much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing

<P>and so becoming!" observed Meg complacently.&nbsp; "Have you anything

<P>decent, Jo?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me.&nbsp; I shall

<P>row and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of.&nbsp; You'll

<P>come, Betty?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you won't let any boys talk to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a boy!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke,

<P>he is so kind.&nbsp; But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything.

<P>I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me,

<P>Jo, so I'll go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's my good girl.&nbsp; You do try to fight off your shyness,

<P>and I love you for it.&nbsp; Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know,
and

<P>a cheery word kind of gives a lift.&nbsp; Thank you, Mother," And Jo

<P>gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March

<P>than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to

<P>copy," said Amy, showing her mail.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over

<P>and play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall

<P>go," added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered

<P>finely.

<P>"Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can

<P>play tomorrow with free minds," said Jo, preparing to replace her

<P>pen with a broom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning

<P>to promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight.&nbsp; Each had

<P>made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper.

<P>Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo

<P>had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth

<P>had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching

<P>separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a colthespin

<P>on her nose to uplift the offending feature.&nbsp; It was one of the

<P>kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards,

<P>therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now

<P>being put.&nbsp; This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for

<P>he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her

<P>sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party,

<P>and soon a lively bustle began in both houses.&nbsp; Beth, who was

<P>ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened

<P>her sisters' toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There goes the man with the tent!&nbsp; I see Mrs. Barker doing

<P>up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket.&nbsp; Now Mr. Laurence
is

<P>looking up at the sky and the weathercock.&nbsp; I wish he would go

<P>too.&nbsp; There's Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy!&nbsp; Oh,
mercy

<P>me!&nbsp; Here's a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl,

<P>and two dreadful boys.&nbsp; One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch.

<P>Laurie didn't tell us that.&nbsp; Be quick, girls!&nbsp; It's getting
late.

<P>Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.&nbsp; Meg, isn't that the man

<P>who bowed to you one day when we were shopping?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So it is.&nbsp; How queer that he should come.&nbsp; I thought he was

<P>at the mountains.&nbsp; There is Sallie.&nbsp; I'm glad she got back
in time.

<P>Am I all right, Jo?" cried Meg in a flutter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A regular daisy.&nbsp; Hold up your dress and put your hat on

<P>straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off

<P>at the first puff.&nbsp; Now then, come on!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat?&nbsp; It's too

<P>absurd!&nbsp; You shall not make a guy of yourself," remonstrated Meg,

<P>as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned

<P>leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big.

<P>It will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable."

<P>With that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed,

<P>a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best in summer

<P>suits, with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the

<P>most cordial manner.&nbsp; The lawn was the reception room, and for

<P>several minutes a lively scene was enacted there.&nbsp; Meg was

<P>grateful to see that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with

<P>a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate, and

<P>who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances that he came

<P>especially to see her.&nbsp; Jo understood why Laurie `primmed up

<P>his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a

<P>standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the

<P>free and easy demeanor of the other girls.&nbsp; Beth took an observation

<P>of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not `dreadful',

<P>but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that

<P>account.&nbsp; Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person,

<P>and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they

<P>suddenly became very good friends.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on

<P>beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats

<P>pushed off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the

<P>shore.&nbsp; Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the

<P>other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to

<P>upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water

<P>bug.&nbsp; Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of

<P>general utility.&nbsp; It broke the ice in the beginning by producing

<P>a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and

<P>fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the

<P>whole party, if a shower came up, she said.&nbsp; Miss Kate decided

<P>that she was `odd', but rather clever, and smiled upon her from

<P>afar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to

<P>face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered

<P>their oars with uncommon `skill and dexterity'.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke was

<P>a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant

<P>voice.&nbsp; Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking

<P>encyclopedia of useful knowledge.&nbsp; He never talked to her much,
but

<P>he looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not

<P>regard her with aversion.&nbsp; Ned, being in college, of course put

<P>on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to

<P>assume.&nbsp; He was not very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether

<P>an excellent person to carry on a picnic.&nbsp; Sallie Gardiner was

<P>absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with

<P>the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and

<P>the wickets down by the time they arrived.&nbsp; A pleasant green field,

<P>with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of

<P>turf for croquet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Welcome to Camp Laurence!" said the young host, as they

<P>landed with exclamations of delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the

<P>other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company.

<P>The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing

<P>room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen.&nbsp;
Now,

<P>let's have a game before it gets hot, and then we'll see about

<P>dinner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game

<P>played by the other eight.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred.

<P>Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned.&nbsp; The English played well, but

<P>the Americans played better, and contested every inch of the

<P>ground as strongly as if the spirit of `76 inspired them.&nbsp; Jo and

<P>Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words.

<P>Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke, which

<P>failure ruffled her a good deal.&nbsp; Fred was close behind her and

<P>his turn came before hers.&nbsp; He gave a stroke, his ball hit the

<P>wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.&nbsp; No one was very

<P>near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his

<P>toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm through!&nbsp; Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in

<P>first," cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another

<P>blow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You pushed it.&nbsp; I saw you.&nbsp; It's my turn now," said Jo

<P>sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, I didn't move it.&nbsp; It rolled a bit, perhaps,

<P>but that is allowed.&nbsp; So, stand off please, and let me have a go

<P>at the stake."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose," said

<P>Jo angrily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows.&nbsp; There

<P>you go!" returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself

<P>in time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering

<P>down a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and

<P>declared himself out with much exultation.&nbsp; She went off to get
her

<P>ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came

<P>back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently.&nbsp; It

<P>took several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she

<P>got there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the

<P>last but one and lay near the stake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By George, it's all up with us!&nbsp; Goodbye, Kate.&nbsp; Miss Jo

<P>owes me one, so you are finished," cried Fred excitedly, as they

<P>all drew near to see the finish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,"

<P>said Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, "especially when

<P>they beat them," she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she

<P>won the game by a clever stroke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do

<P>to exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle

<P>of the cheer to whisper to his friend, "Good for you, Jo!&nbsp; He did

<P>cheat, I saw him.&nbsp; We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again,

<P>take my word for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose

<P>braid, and said approvingly, "It was dreadfully provoking, but you

<P>kept your temper, and I'm so glad, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute.

<P>I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the

<P>nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue..

<P>It's simmering now, so I hope he'll keep out of my way," returned

<P>Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Time for lunch," said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.

<P>"Commissary general, will you make the fire and get water, while

<P>Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table?&nbsp; Who can make
good

<P>coffee?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo can," said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.&nbsp; So Jo,

<P>feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went

<P>to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry

<P>sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near

<P>by.&nbsp; Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making

<P>little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the

<P>tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables,

<P>prettily decorated with green leaves.&nbsp; Jo announced that the coffee

<P>was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth

<P>is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites.

<P>A very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and

<P>frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near

<P>by.&nbsp; There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced

<P>many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little

<P>black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and

<P>fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going

<P>on.&nbsp; Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an

<P>objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river

<P>with all his might and main.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's salt here," said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer

<P>of berries.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, I prefer spiders," she replied, fishing up two

<P>unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death.&nbsp; "How dare

<P>you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when your's is so

<P>nice in every way?' added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out

<P>of one plate, the china having run short.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got

<P>over it yet.&nbsp; This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do

<P>anything.&nbsp; It's you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and

<P>I'm no end obliged to you.&nbsp; what shall we do when we can't eat

<P>anymore?" asked Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been

<P>played when lunch was over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have games till it's cooler.&nbsp; I brought Authors, and I dare

<P>say Miss Kate knows something new and nice.&nbsp; Go and ask her.&nbsp;
She's

<P>company, and you ought to stay with her more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aren't you company too?&nbsp; I thought she'd suit Brooke, but

<P>he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that

<P>ridiculous glass of hers'.&nbsp; I'm going, so you needn't try to preach

<P>propriety, for you can't do it, Jo."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would

<P>not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to

<P>the drawing room to play Rig-marole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells

<P>as long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some

<P>exciting point, when the next takes it up and does the same.&nbsp; It's

<P>very funny when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical

<P>comical stuff to laugh over.&nbsp; Please start it, Mr. Brooke," said

<P>Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the

<P>tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr.

<P>Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes

<P>steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek

<P>his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield.

<P>He traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and

<P>had a hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old

<P>king, who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train

<P>a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond.&nbsp; The knight

<P>agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a

<P>gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though

<P>he was freakish and wild.&nbsp; Every day, when he gave his lessons
to

<P>this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city, and

<P>as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face,

<P>which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.&nbsp; One

<P>day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window

<P>of a ruinous castle the lovely face.&nbsp; He was delighted, inquired

<P>who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive

<P>princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay

<P>up money to buy their liberty.&nbsp; The knight wished intensely that

<P>he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each

<P>day, watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in

<P>the sunshine.&nbsp; At last he resolved to get into the castle and

<P>ask how he could help them.&nbsp; He went and knocked.&nbsp; The great

<P>door flew open, and he beheld .&nbsp; .."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of

<P>rapture, `At last!&nbsp; At last!'" continued Kate, who had read

<P>French novels, and admired the style.&nbsp; "`Tis she!' cried Count

<P>Gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy.&nbsp; `Oh, rise!'

<P>she said, extending a hand of marble fairness.&nbsp; `Never! Till you

<P>tell me how I may rescue you, ' swore the knight, still kneeling.

<P>`Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant

<P>is destroyed.' `Where is the villain?' `In the mauve salon.&nbsp; Go,

<P>brave heart, and save me from despair.' `I obey, and return

<P>victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away,

<P>and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter,

<P>when he received..."

<P>"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old

<P>fellow in a black gown fired at him," said Ned.&nbsp; "Instantly, Sir

<P>What's-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the

<P>window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump

<P>on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a

<P>rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went

<P>headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below.&nbsp; Could swim like a

<P>duck, paddled round the castle till he came to a little door

<P>guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till

<P>they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion

<P>of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a

<P>pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big

<P>as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics,

<P>MIss March.&nbsp; At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight

<P>that took his breath away and chilled his blood..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a

<P>lamp in its wasted hand," went on Meg.&nbsp; "It beckoned, gliding

<P>noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any

<P>tomb.&nbsp; Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead

<P>silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever

<P>and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful

<P>eyes through its white veil.&nbsp; They reached a curtained door, behind

<P>which sounded lovely music.&nbsp; He sprang forward to enter, but the

<P>specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Snuffbox," said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the

<P>audience.&nbsp; "`Thankee, ' said the knight politely, as he took a
pinch

<P>and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.&nbsp; `Ha!

<P>Ha!' laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the

<P>princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up

<P>her victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven

<P>other knights packed together without their heads, like sardines,

<P>who all rose and began to..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dance a hornpipe," cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, "and,

<P>as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in

<P>full sail.&nbsp; `Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard

<P>alee, and man the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate

<P>hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast.

<P>`Go in and win, my hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous

<P>fight began.&nbsp; Of course the British beat, they always do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, they don't!" cried Jo, aside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over

<P>the schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose

<P>lee scuppers ran blood, for the order had been `Cutlasses, and

<P>die hard!' `Bosun's mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet,

<P>and start this villain if he doesn't confess his sins double

<P>quick, ' said the British captain.&nbsp; The Portuguese held his tongue

<P>like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered

<P>like mad.&nbsp; But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war,

<P>scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, `To the

<P>bottom of the sea, sea, sea' where..."

<P>"Oh, gracious!&nbsp; What shall I say?" cried Sallie, as Fred

<P>ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell

<P>nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books.

<P>"Well, they went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them,

<P>but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and

<P>kindly pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery

<P>about them, for being a woman, she was curious.&nbsp; By-and-by a diver

<P>came down, and the mermaid said, `I'll give you a box of pearls

<P>if you can take it up, ' for she wanted to restore the poor things

<P>to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.&nbsp; So the diver

<P>hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find

<P>no pearls.&nbsp; He left it in a great lonely field, where it was

<P>found by a..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,"

<P>said Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out.&nbsp; "The little girl was

<P>sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help

<P>them.&nbsp; `Your geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the

<P>old woman.&nbsp; So she asked what she should use for new heads, since

<P>the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred

<P>mouths and screamed..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Cabbages!'" continued Laurie promptly.&nbsp; "`Just the thing, '

<P>said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden.

<P>She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and

<P>went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for

<P>there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one

<P>thought anything of it.&nbsp; The knight in whom I'm interest went back

<P>to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun

<P>themselves free and all gone and married, but one.&nbsp; He was in a

<P>great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood by

<P>him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was

<P>left.&nbsp; Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections

<P>picking flowers in her garden.&nbsp; `Will you give me a rose?' said

<P>he.&nbsp; `You must come and get it.&nbsp; I can't come to you, it isn't

<P>proper, ' said she, as sweet as honey.&nbsp; He tried to climb over

<P>the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.&nbsp; Then he

<P>tried to push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he

<P>was in despair.&nbsp; So he patiently broke twig after twig till he

<P>had made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly,

<P>`Let me in!&nbsp; Let me in!' But the pretty princess did not seem

<P>to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, and left him

<P>to fight his way in.&nbsp; Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't.&nbsp; I'm not playing, I never do," said Frank, dismayed

<P>at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the

<P>absurd couple.&nbsp; Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was

<P>asleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is

<P>he?" asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing

<P>with the wild rose in his buttonhole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate

<P>after a while," said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw

<P>acorns at his tutor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a piece of nonsense we have made!&nbsp; With practice we

<P>might do something quite clever.&nbsp; Do you know Truth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope so," said Meg soberly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The game, I mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"what is it?" said Fred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out

<P>in turn, and the person who draws at the number has to answer

<P>truly any question put by the rest.&nbsp; It's great fun."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let's try it," said Jo, who liked new experiments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Kate and Mr. Booke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred,

<P>Sallie, Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who are your heroes?" asked Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Grandfather and Napoleon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which lady here do you think prettiest?" said Sallie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Margaret."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which do you like best?" from Fred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo, of course."

<P>"What silly questions you ask!"&nbsp; And Jo gave a disdainful

<P>shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie's matter-of-fact tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try again.&nbsp; Truth isn't a bad game," said Fred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a very good one for you," retorted Jo in a low voice.

<P>Her turn came next.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is your greatest fault?' asked Fred, by way of testing

<P>in her the virtue he lacked himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A quick temper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you most wish for?" said Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A pair of boot lacings," returned Jo, guessing and defeating his purpose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a true answer.&nbsp; You must say what you really do want most."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Genius.&nbsp; Don't you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?"

<P>And she slyly smiled in his disappointed face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What virtues do you most admire in a man?" asked Sallie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Courage and honesty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now my turn," said Fred, as his hand came last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let's give it to him," whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded

<P>and asked at once...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't you cheat at croquet?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, yes, a little bit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good!&nbsp; Didn't you take your story out of THE SEA LION?"

<P>said Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Rather."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?"

<P>asked Sallie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should be ashamed of myself if I didn't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's a true John Bull.&nbsp; Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have

<P>a chance without waiting to draw.&nbsp; I'll harrrow up your feelings

<P>first by asking if you don't think you are something of a flirt,"

<P>said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You impertinent boy!&nbsp; Of course I'm not," exclaimed Sallie,

<P>with an air that proved the contrary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you hate most?" asked Fred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Spiders and rice pudding."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you like best?" asked Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dancing and French gloves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I think Truth is a very silly play.&nbsp; Let's have a

<P>sensible game of Authors to refresh our minds," proposed Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ned, frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it

<P>went on, the three elders sat apart, talking.&nbsp; Miss Kate took out

<P>her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay

<P>on the grass with a book, which he did not read.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How beautifully you do it!&nbsp; I wish I could draw," said Meg,

<P>with mingled admiration and regret in her voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why don't you learn?&nbsp; I should think you had taste and talent

<P>for it," replied Miss Kate graciously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.&nbsp; So did

<P>mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons

<P>privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on.&nbsp; Can't

<P>you do the same with your governess?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have none."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with

<P>us.&nbsp; Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says.&nbsp; You go to
a

<P>private one, I suppose?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't go at all.&nbsp; I am a governess myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh.&nbsp; indeed!" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said,

<P>"Dear me, how dreadful!" for her tone implied it, and something in

<P>her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, Young ladies in America

<P>love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired

<P>and respected for supporting themselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do

<P>so.&nbsp; We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do

<P>the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the

<P>daughters of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished,

<P>you know," said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's

<P>pride, and made her work seem not only more distasteful, but

<P>degrading.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did the German song suit, Miss March?" inquired Mr. Brooke,

<P>breaking an awkward pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes!&nbsp; It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever

<P>translated it for me." And Meg's downcast face brightened as she spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you read German?" asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not very well.&nbsp; My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't

<P>get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try a little now.&nbsp; Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor
who

<P>loves to teach."&nbsp; And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with

<P>an inviting smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's so hard I'm afraid to try," said Meg, grateful, but bashful

<P>in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll read a bit to encourage you." And Miss Kate read one

<P>of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but

<P>perfectly expressionless manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg,

<P>who said innocently, "I thought it was poetry."

<P>"Some of it is.&nbsp; Try this passage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he

<P>opened at poor Mary's lament.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new

<P>tutor used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously

<P>making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her

<P>musical voice.&nbsp; Down the page went the green guide, and presently,

<P>forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read

<P>as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the

<P>unhappy queen.&nbsp; If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would

<P>have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was

<P>not spoiled for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well indeed!" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring

<P>her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of

<P>the little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with

<P>condescension, "You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever

<P>reader.&nbsp; I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable

<P>accomplishment to teachers.&nbsp; I must look after Grace, she is romping."

<P>And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, "I

<P>didn't come to chaperone a governess, though she is young and

<P>pretty.&nbsp; What odd people these Yankees are.&nbsp; I'm afraid Laurie

<P>will be quite spoiled among them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at

<P>governesses and don't treat them as we do," said Meg, looking

<P>after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know

<P>to my sorrow.&nbsp; There's no place like America for us workers, Miss

<P>Margaret."&nbsp; And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that

<P>Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad I live in it then.&nbsp; I don't like my work, but I get

<P>a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain.

<P>I only wished I liked teaching as you do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil.&nbsp; I shall

<P>be very sorry to lose him next year," said Mr. Brooke, busily

<P>punching holes in the turf.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Going to college, I suppose?" Meg's lips asked the question,

<P>but her eyes added, "And what becomes of you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as

<P>he is off, I shall turn soldier.&nbsp; I am needed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad of that!" exclaimed Meg.&nbsp; "I should think every

<P>young man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers

<P>and sisters who stay at home," she added sorrowfully.

<P>"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live

<P>or die," said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the

<P>dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a

<P>little grave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we

<P>should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you," said

<P>Meg heartily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, that sounds pleasant," began Mr. Brooke, looking

<P>cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted

<P>on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill

<P>before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you love to ride?" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood

<P>resting after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dote upon it.&nbsp; My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was

<P>rich, but we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree," added

<P>Amy, laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me about Ellen Tree.&nbsp; Is it a donkey?" asked Grace

<P>curiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but

<P>we've only got an old sidesaddle and no horse.&nbsp; Out in our

<P>garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put

<P>the saddle on it, fixed some reins on the part that turns up,

<P>and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How funny!" laughed Grace.&nbsp; "I have a pony at home, and

<P>ride nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate.&nbsp; It's very

<P>nice, for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and

<P>gentlemen."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear, how charming!&nbsp; I hope I shall go abroad some day,

<P>but I'd rather go to Rome than the row," said Amy, who had

<P>not the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn't have asked

<P>for the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they

<P>were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient

<P>gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of

<P>comical gymnastics.&nbsp; Beth, who was collecting the scattered

<P>Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way,

<P>"I'm afraid you are tired.&nbsp; Can I do anything for you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Talk to me, please.&nbsp; It's dull, sitting by myself," answered

<P>Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.

<P>If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not

<P>have seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there

<P>was no place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor

<P>boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you like to talk about?" she asked, fumbling over

<P>the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,"

<P>said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to

<P>his strength.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My heart!&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; I don't know anything about them,

<P>thought Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry,

<P>she said, hoping to make him talk, "I never saw any hunting, but

<P>I suppose you know all about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping

<P>a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and

<P>hounds for me," said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself

<P>for her innocent blunder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes," she

<P>said, turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she

<P>had read one of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness

<P>to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious

<P>of her sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle

<P>of Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she

<P>had begged protection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless her heart!&nbsp; She pities him, so she is good to him,"

<P>aid Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I always said she was a little saint," added Meg, as if

<P>there could be no further doubt of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long," said

<P>Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets

<P>out of the acorn cups.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,"

<P>said Amy, well pleased at Beth's success.&nbsp; She meant `facinating',

<P>but as Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word,

<P>fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of

<P>croquet finished the afternoon.&nbsp; At sunset the tent was struck,

<P>hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole

<P>party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices.

<P>Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive

<P>refrain...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>and at the lines...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We each are young, we each have a heart,

<P>Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she

<P>laughed outright and spoiled his song.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How can you be so cruel to me?" he whispered, under cover

<P>of a lively chorus.&nbsp; "You've kept close to that starched-up

<P>Englishwoman all day, and now you snub me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't

<P>help it," replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach,

<P>for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the

<P>Moffat party and the talk after it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying

<P>to her rather pettishly, "There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl,

<P>is there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a particle, but she's a dear," returned Sallie, defending

<P>her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's not a stricken deer anyway," said Ned, trying to be

<P>witty, and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated

<P>with cordial good nights and good-bys, for the Vaughns were going

<P>to Canada.&nbsp; As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss

<P>Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in

<P>her voice, "In spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls

<P>are very nice when one knows them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I quite agree with you," said Mr. Brooke.
