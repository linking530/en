<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which

<P>followed.&nbsp; The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began

<P>to talk or returning early in the new year.&nbsp; Beth was soon able

<P>to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the

<P>well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll's sewing, which had

<P>fallen sadly behindhand.&nbsp; Her once active limbs were so stiff

<P>and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house

<P>in her strong arms.&nbsp; Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her

<P>white hands cooking delicate messes for `the dear', while Amy,

<P>a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as

<P>many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt

<P>the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing

<P>utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor

<P>of this unusually merry Christmas.&nbsp; Laurie was equally impracticable,

<P>and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches,

<P>if he had had his own way.&nbsp; After many skirmishes and snubbings,

<P>the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched

<P>and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied

<P>by explosions of laughter when the two got together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a

<P>splendid Christmas Day.&nbsp; Hannah `felt in her bones' that it was

<P>going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a

<P>true prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to

<P>produce a grand success.&nbsp; To begin with, Mr. March wrote that

<P>he should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well

<P>that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's gift, a soft

<P>crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the window

<P>to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.&nbsp; The Unquenchables had

<P>done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they

<P>had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.&nbsp; Out in

<P>the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly,

<P>bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll

<P>of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her

<P>chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips

<P>on a pink paper streamer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>God bless you, dear Queen Bess!

<P>May nothing you dismay,

<P>But health and peace and happiness

<P>Be yours, this Christmas day.

<P>Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,

<P>And flowers for her nose.

<P>Here's music for her pianee,

<P>An afghan for her toes,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A portrait of Joanna, see,

<P>By Raphael No.&nbsp; 2,

<P>Who laboured with great industry

<P>To make it fair and true.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Accept a ribbon red, I beg,

<P>For Madam Purrer's tail,

<P>And ice cream made by lovely Peg,

<P>A Mont Blanc in a pail.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their dearest love my makers laid

<P>Within my breast of snow.

<P>Accept it, and the Alpine maid,

<P>From Laurie and from Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and

<P>down to bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo

<P>made as she presented them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I

<P>couldn't hold one drop more," said Beth, quite sighing with

<P>contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the

<P>excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious

<P>grapes the `Jungfrau' had sent her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So am I," added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed

<P>the long-desired UNDINE AND SINTRAM.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm sure I am," echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy

<P>of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a

<P>pretty frame.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course I am!" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of

<P>her first sild dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.

<P>"How can I be otherwise?" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her

<P>eyes went from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and

<P>her hand carressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut

<P>and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her

<P>breast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in

<P>the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.&nbsp; Half

<P>an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could

<P>only hold one drop more, the drop came.&nbsp; Laurie opened the parlor

<P>door and popped his head in very quietly.&nbsp; He might just as well

<P>have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his

<P>face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so

<P>treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said,

<P>in a queer, breathless voice, "Here's another Christmas present

<P>for the March family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked

<P>away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to

<P>the eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say

<P>something and couldn't.&nbsp; Of course there was a general stampede,

<P>and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for

<P>the strangest things were done, and no one said a word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of

<P>loving arms.&nbsp; Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and

<P>had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke

<P>kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently

<P>explained.&nbsp; And Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never

<P>stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in

<P>the most touching manner.&nbsp; Mrs. March was the first to recover

<P>herself, and held up her hand with a warning, "Hush!&nbsp; Remember
Beth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But it was too late.&nbsp; The study door flew open, the little

<P>red wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the

<P>feeble limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father's arms.&nbsp; Never

<P>mind what happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed,

<P>washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the

<P>sweetness of the present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody

<P>straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing

<P>over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she

<P>rushed up from the kitchen.&nbsp; As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March
began

<P>to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which

<P>Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and

<P>seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired.&nbsp; Then the two invalids

<P>were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one

<P>big chair and talking hard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how,

<P>when the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor, to

<P>take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was

<P>altogether a most estimable and upright young man.&nbsp; Why Mr. March

<P>paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was

<P>violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring

<P>lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine.&nbsp; Also why Mrs.

<P>March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he

<P>wouldn't like to have something to eat.&nbsp; Jo saw and understood

<P>the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea,

<P>muttering to herself as she slammed the door, "I hate estimable

<P>young men with brown eyes!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day.

<P>The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up,

<P>stuffed, browned, and decorated.&nbsp; So was the plum pudding, which

<P>melted in one's mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled

<P>like a fly in a honeypot.&nbsp; Everything turned out well, which was

<P>a mercy, Hannah said, "For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that

<P>it's a merrycle I didn't roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey

<P>with raisins, let alone bilin' of it in a cloth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr.

<P>Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement.

<P>Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in

<P>which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a

<P>little fruit.&nbsp; They drank healths, told stories, sang songs,

<P>`reminisced', as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time.

<P>A sleigh ride had been planned, but the girls would not leave their

<P>father, so the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the

<P>happy family sat together round the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we

<P>expected to have.&nbsp; Do you remember?" asked Jo, breaking a short

<P>pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!" said Meg, smiling at

<P>the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke

<P>with dignity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think it's been a pretty hard one," observed Amy, watching

<P>the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"i'm glad it's over, because we've got you back," whispered

<P>Beth, who sat on her father's knee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims,

<P>especially the latter part of it.&nbsp; But you have got on bravely,

<P>and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,"

<P>said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four

<P>young faces gathered round him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you know?&nbsp; Did Mother tell you?' asked Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not much.&nbsp; Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've

<P>made several discoveries today."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, tell us what they are!" cried Meg, who sat beside him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here is one." And taking up the hand which lay on the arm

<P>of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on

<P>the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm.&nbsp; "I

<P>remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your

<P>first care was to keep it so.&nbsp; It was very pretty then, but to

<P>me it is much prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read

<P>a little history.&nbsp; A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this

<P>hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and I'm

<P>sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long

<P>time, so much good will went into the stitches.&nbsp; Meg, my dear,

<P>I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white

<P>hands or fashionable accomplishments.&nbsp; I'm proud to shake this

<P>good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be

<P>asked to give it away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she

<P>received it in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the

<P>approving smile he gave her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What about Jo?&nbsp; Please say something nice, for she has tried

<P>so hard and been so very, very good to me," said Beth in her father's

<P>ear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite,

<P>with and unusually mild expression in her face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the `son Jo' whom I

<P>left a year ago," said Mr. March.&nbsp; "I see a young lady who pins

<P>her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles,

<P>talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do.&nbsp; Her face is

<P>rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I

<P>like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is

<P>lower.&nbsp; She doesn't bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of

<P>a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me.&nbsp; I

<P>rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful,

<P>tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied.

<P>I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do

<P>know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough

<P>to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin

<P>face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise,

<P>feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear

<P>she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used

<P>to be," began their father cheerfully.&nbsp; But recollecting how nearly

<P>he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek

<P>against his own, "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so,

<P>please God."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on

<P>the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining

<P>hair...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands

<P>for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and

<P>has waited on every on with patience and good humor.&nbsp; I also

<P>observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has

<P>not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I

<P>conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of

<P>herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as

<P>carefully as she molds her little clay figures.&nbsp; I am glad of

<P>this, for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made

<P>by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with

<P>a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you thinking of, Beth?" asked Jo, when Amy had

<P>thanked her father and told about her ring.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I read in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS today how, after many troubles,

<P>christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies

<P>bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do

<P>now, before they went on to their journey's end," answered Beth,

<P>adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the

<P>instrument, "It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old

<P>place.&nbsp; I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the

<P>Pilgrims heard.&nbsp; I made the music for Father, because he likes

<P>the verses."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the

<P>keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again,

<P>sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a

<P>singularly fitting song for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He that is down need fear no fall,

<P>He that is low no pride.

<P>He that is humble ever shall

<P>Have God to be his guide.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I am content with what I have,

<P>Little be it, or much.

<P>And, Lord!&nbsp; Contentment still I crave,

<P>Because Thou savest such.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fulness to them a burden is,

<P>That go on pilgrimage.

<P>Here little, and hereafter bliss,

<P>Is best from age to age!
