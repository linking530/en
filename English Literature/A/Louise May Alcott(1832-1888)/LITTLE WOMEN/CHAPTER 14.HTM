<P>Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began

<P>to grow chilly, and the afternoons were short.&nbsp; For two or three

<P>hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated

<P>on the old sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out

<P>upon a trunk before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat,

<P>promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied by his oldest son,

<P>a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers.

<P>Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the last page

<P>was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and threw

<P>down her pen, exclaiming...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, I've done my best!&nbsp; If this won't suit I shall have

<P>to wait till I can do better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully

<P>through, making dashes here and there, and putting in many

<P>exclamation points, which looked like little balloons.&nbsp; Then she

<P>tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at

<P>it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how

<P>ernest her work had been.&nbsp; Jo's desk up here was an old tin

<P>kitchen which hung against the wall.&nbsp; It it she kept her papers,

<P>and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being

<P>likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating

<P>library of such books as were left in his way by eating the

<P>leaves.&nbsp; From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript,

<P>and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving

<P>her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and

<P>going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low

<P>porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout

<P>way to the road.&nbsp; Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing

<P>omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her

<P>movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a

<P>great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy

<P>street.&nbsp; Having found the place with some difficulty, she went

<P>into the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing

<P>stock still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked

<P>away as rapidly as she came.&nbsp; This maneuver she repeated several

<P>times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman

<P>lounging in the window of a building opposite.&nbsp; On returning for

<P>the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her

<P>eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if she were going to

<P>have all her teeth out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the

<P>entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial

<P>jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine

<P>set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat,

<P>and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying

<P>with a smile and a shiver, "It's like her to come alone, but if

<P>she has a bad time she'll need someone to help her home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red

<P>face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed

<P>through a trying ordeal of some sort.&nbsp; When she saw the young

<P>gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a

<P>nod.&nbsp; But he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, "Did you

<P>have a bad time?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not very."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You got through quickly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, thank goodness!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why did you go alone?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't want anyone to know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw.&nbsp; How many did you

<P>have out?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then

<P>began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait

<P>a week."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you laughing at?&nbsp; You are up to some mischief, Jo,"

<P>said Laurie, looking mystified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So are you.&nbsp; What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard

<P>saloon?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but

<P>a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"why?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can teach me, and then when we play HAMLET, you can be

<P>Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made

<P>several passers-by smile in spite of themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll teach you whether we play HAMLET or not.&nbsp; It's grand

<P>fun and will straighten you up capitally.&nbsp; But I don't believe

<P>that was your only reason for saying `I'm glad' in that decided

<P>way, was it now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I

<P>hope you never go to such places.&nbsp; Do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not often."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you wouldn't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's no harm, Jo.&nbsp; I have billiards at home, but it's no fun

<P>unless you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes

<P>and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and

<P>better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful

<P>boys.&nbsp; I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction
to

<P>your friends," said Jo, shaking her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then

<P>without losing his respectability?" asked Laurie, looking nettled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That depends upon how and where he takes it.&nbsp; I don't like

<P>Ned and his set, and wish you'd keep out of it.&nbsp; Mother won't let

<P>us have him at our house, though he wants to come.&nbsp; And if you

<P>grow like him she won't be willing to have us frolic together as

<P>we do now."

<P>"Won't she?" asked Laurie anxiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us

<P>all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet.&nbsp; I'm not a

<P>fashionable party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless

<P>larks now and then, don't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild,

<P>will you?&nbsp; Or there will be an end of all our good times."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll be a double distilled saint."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't bear saints.&nbsp; Just be a simple, honest, respectable

<P>boy, and we'll never desert you.&nbsp; I don't know what I should do

<P>if you acted like Mr. King's son.&nbsp; He had plenty of money, but

<P>didn't know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran

<P>away, and forged his father's name, I believe, and was altogether

<P>horrid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think I'm likely to do the same?&nbsp; Much obliged."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I don't--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about

<P>money being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor.

<P>I shouldn't worry then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you worry about me, Jo?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,

<P>for you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong,

<P>I'm afraid it would be hard to stop you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him,

<P>wishing she had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though

<P>his lips smiled as if at her warnings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?" he

<P>asked presently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course not.&nbsp; Why?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because if you are, I'll take a bus.&nbsp; If you're not, I'd like

<P>to walk with you and tell you something very interesting."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news

<P>immensely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, then, come on.&nbsp; It's a secret, and if I tell you,

<P>you must tell me yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I haven't got any," began Jo, but stopped suddenly,

<P>remembering that she had.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know you have--you can't hide anything, so up and fess,

<P>or I won't tell," cried Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is your secret a nice one?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, isn't it!&nbsp; All about people you know, and such fun!&nbsp;
You

<P>ought to hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time.

<P>Come, you begin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a word."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you won't tease me in private?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never tease."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you do.&nbsp; You get everything you want out of people.&nbsp;
I

<P>don't know how you do it, but you are a born wheedler."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; Fire away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's to

<P>give his answer next week," whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!"

<P>cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the

<P>great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a

<P>dozen Irish children, for they were out of the city now.

<P>"Hush!&nbsp; It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't

<P>rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't

<P>want anyone else to be disappointed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It won't fail.&nbsp; Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare

<P>compared to half the rubbish that is published every day.

<P>Won't it be fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of

<P>our authoress?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed

<P>in, and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper

<P>puffs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where's your secret?&nbsp; Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe

<P>you again," she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that

<P>blazed up at a word of encouragement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise

<P>not to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told

<P>you any plummy bit of news I get.&nbsp; I know where Meg's glove is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is that all? said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded

<P>and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I

<P>tell you where it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell, then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which

<P>produced a comical change.&nbsp; She stood and stared at him for a

<P>minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on,

<P>saying sharply, "How do you know?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Saw it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pocket."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All this time?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, isn't that romantic?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it's horrid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't you like it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course I don't.&nbsp; It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed.&nbsp;
My

<P>patience!&nbsp; What would Meg say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not to tell anyone.&nbsp; Mind that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't promise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That was understood, and I trusted you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and

<P>wish you hadn't told me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you'd be pleased."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you

<P>away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'd like to see anyone try it," cried Jo fiercely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So should I!"&nbsp; And Laurie chuckled at the idea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in

<P>my mind since you told me that," said Jo rather ungratefully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,"

<P>suggested Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before

<P>her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon

<P>leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran.

<P>Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the

<P>success of his treatment, for his Atalanta came panting up

<P>with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of

<P>dissatisfaction in her face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this

<P>splendid air, and not lose my breath.&nbsp; It was capital, but see

<P>what a guy it's made me.&nbsp; Go, pick up my things, like a cherub,

<P>as you are," said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which

<P>was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and

<P>Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she

<P>was tidy again.&nbsp; But someone did pass, and who should it be but

<P>Meg, looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival

<P>suit, for she had been making calls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What in the world are you doing here?" she asked, regarding

<P>her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Getting leaves," meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful

<P>she had just swept up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And hairpins," added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's

<P>lap.&nbsp; "They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw

<P>hats."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have been running, Jo.&nbsp; How could you?&nbsp; When will you
stop

<P>such romping ways?" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs

<P>and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch.&nbsp; Don't

<P>try to make me grow up before my time, Meg.&nbsp; It's hard enough to

<P>have you change all of a sudden.&nbsp; Let me be a little girl as long

<P>as I can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling

<P>of her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting

<P>to be a woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation

<P>which must surely come some time and now seemed very near.&nbsp; He
saw

<P>the trouble in her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking

<P>quickly, "Where have you been calling, all so fine?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about

<P>Belle Moffat's wedding.&nbsp; It was very splendid, and they have gone

<P>to spend the winter in Paris.&nbsp; Just think how delightful that

<P>must be!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you envy her, Meg?" said Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm afraid I do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of it!" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why?" asked Meg, looking surprised.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and

<P>marry a poor man," said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely

<P>warning her to mind what she said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall never `go and marry' anyone," observed Meg, walking

<P>on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing,

<P>whispering, skipping stones, and `behaving like children',

<P>as Meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted

<P>to join them if she had not had her best dress on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters

<P>were quite bewildered.&nbsp; She rushed to the door when the postman

<P>rang, was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking

<P>at Meg with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake

<P>and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner.&nbsp; Laurie and she

<P>were always making signs to one another, and talking about

<P>`Spread Eagles' till the girls declared they had both lost their

<P>wits.&nbsp; On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg,

<P>as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the sight of

<P>Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing her

<P>in Amy's bower.&nbsp; What went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks

<P>of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a

<P>great flapping of newspapers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall we do with that girl?&nbsp; She never will behave like

<P>a young lady," sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a

<P>disapproving face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope she won't.&nbsp; She is so funny and dear as she is," said

<P>Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's

<P>having secrets with anyone but her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,"

<P>added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her

<P>curls tied up in a very becoming way., two agreeable things that

<P>made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa,

<P>and affected to read.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you anything interesting there?" asked Meg, with condescension.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess," returned

<P>Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd better read it aloud.&nbsp; That will amuse us and keep you

<P>out of mischief," said Amy in her most grown-up tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's the name?" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face

<P>behind the sheet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Rival Painters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That sounds well.&nbsp; Read it," said Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a loud "Hem!" and a long breath, Jo began to read very

<P>fast.&nbsp; The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic,

<P>and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.

<P>"I like that about the splendid picture," was Amy's approving

<P>remark, as Jo paused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I prefer the lovering part.&nbsp; Viola and Angelo are two of our

<P>favorite names, isn't that queer?" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for

<P>the lovering part was tragical.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who wrote it?" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's

<P>face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying

<P>a flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and

<P>excitement replied in a loud voice, "Your sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You?" cried Meg, dropping her work.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's very good," said Amy critically.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew it!&nbsp; I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!"&nbsp; And Beth

<P>ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!&nbsp; How Meg

<P>wouldn't believe it till she saw the words.&nbsp; "Miss Josephine

<P>March," actually printed in the paper.&nbsp; How graciously Amy

<P>critisized the artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for

<P>a sequel, which unfortunately couldn't be carried out, as the

<P>hero and heroine were dead.&nbsp; How Beth got excited, and skipped

<P>and sang with joy.&nbsp; How Hannah came in to exclaim, "Sakes alive,

<P>well I never!" in great astonishment at `that Jo's doin's'.&nbsp; How

<P>proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.&nbsp; How Jo laughed, with

<P>tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock

<P>and done with it.&nbsp; and how th `Spread Eagle' might be said to

<P>flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the

<P>paper passed from hand to hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell us about it."&nbsp; "When did it come?" "How much did you

<P>get for it?" "What will Father say?" "Won't Laurie laugh?" cried

<P>the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for

<P>these foolish, affectionate people mad a jubilee of every little

<P>household joy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,"

<P>said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her

<P>Evilina than she did over her `Rival Painters'.&nbsp; Having told

<P>how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, "And when I went to

<P>get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn't

<P>pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed

<P>the stories.&nbsp; It was good practice, he said, and when the

<P>beginners improved, anyone would pay.&nbsp; So I let him have the two

<P>stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me

<P>with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.&nbsp; And he said

<P>it was good, and I shall write more, and he's going to get the

<P>next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to

<P>support myself and help the girls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the

<P>paper, she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears,

<P>for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved

<P>were the dearest wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the

<P>first step toward that happy end.
