<P>Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters

<P>hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to

<P>look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a

<P>fair way to be killed by kindness.&nbsp; As he sat propped up in a

<P>big chair by Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and

<P>Hannah popping in her head now and then `to peek at the dear

<P>man', nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness.&nbsp; But

<P>something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none

<P>confessed the fact.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another

<P>with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.&nbsp; Jo

<P>had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at

<P>Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall.&nbsp; Meg

<P>was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang,

<P>and colored when John's name was mentioned.&nbsp; Amy said,

<P>"Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle down,

<P>which was queer, since Father was safe at home," and Beth innocently

<P>wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as usual.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window,

<P>seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell

<P>down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair,

<P>and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon.

<P>And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung

<P>imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the

<P>corner as if in utter despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What does the goose mean?" said Meg, laughing and trying to

<P>look unconscious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by.

<P>Touchin, isn't it?" answered Jo scornfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true," but Meg's voice

<P>lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.&nbsp; "Please

<P>don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and

<P>there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and

<P>go on as before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief

<P>has spoiled you for me.&nbsp; I see it, and so does Mother.&nbsp; You
are not

<P>like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.&nbsp; I

<P>don't mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish

<P>it was all settled.&nbsp; I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do
it,

<P>make haste and have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because

<P>Father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work

<P>with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite

<P>agree with her father on that point.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would

<P>cry or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a

<P>good, decided no."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not so silly and weak as you think.&nbsp; I know just what

<P>I should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken

<P>unawares.&nbsp; There's no knowing what may happen, and I wished to

<P>be prepared."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had

<P>unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty

<P>color varying in her cheeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?" asked Jo more

<P>respectfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all.&nbsp; You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be

<P>my confidente, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by,

<P>perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't mean to have any.&nbsp; It's fun to watch other people

<P>philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself," said

<P>Jo, looking alarmed at the thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked

<P>you."&nbsp; Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane

<P>where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer

<P>twilight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,"

<P>said Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, `Thank

<P>you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that

<P>I am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please

<P>say no more, but let us be friends as we were."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough!&nbsp; I don't believe you'll

<P>ever say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do.&nbsp; If he

<P>goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather

<P>than hurt his feelings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I won't.&nbsp; I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and

<P>shall walk out of the room with dignity."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the

<P>dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her

<P>seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing

<P>that particular seam in a given time.&nbsp; Jo smothered a laugh

<P>at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened

<P>the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good afternoon.&nbsp; I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see

<P>how your father finds himself today," said Mr. Brooke, getting a

<P>trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's very well, he's in the rack.&nbsp; I'll get him, and tell it

<P>you are here."&nbsp; And having jumbled her father and the umbrella
well

<P>together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a

<P>chance to make her speech and air her dignity.&nbsp; But the instant
she

<P>vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mother will like to see you.&nbsp; Pray sit down, I'll call her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't go.&nbsp; Are you afraid of me, Margaret?" And Mr. Brooke

<P>looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very

<P>rude.&nbsp; She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for
he

<P>had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to

<P>find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it.&nbsp; Anxious

<P>to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a

<P>confiding gesture, and said gratefully...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father?

<P>I only wish I could thank you for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small

<P>hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much

<P>love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she

<P>both longed to run away and to stop and listen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not," she said, trying to

<P>withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I won't trouble you.&nbsp; I only want to know if you care for

<P>me a little, Meg.&nbsp; I love you so much, dear," added Mr. Brooke

<P>tenderly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg

<P>didn't make it.&nbsp; She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and

<P>answered, "I don't know," so softly that John had to stoop down

<P>to catch the foolish little reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled

<P>to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand

<P>gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, "Will you try and

<P>find out?&nbsp; I want to know so much, for I can't go to work with

<P>any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end

<P>or not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm too young," faltered Meg, wondering was she was so

<P>fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to

<P>like me.&nbsp; Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not if I chose to learn it, but. . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Please choose to learn, Meg.&nbsp; I love you to teach, and this

<P>is easier than German," broke in John, getting possession of the

<P>other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent

<P>to look into it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look

<P>at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and

<P>that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his

<P>success.&nbsp; This nettled her.&nbsp; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons
in

<P>coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps

<P>in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a

<P>sudden and took possession of her.&nbsp; She felt excited and

<P>strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a

<P>capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly,

<P>"I don't choose.&nbsp; Please go away and let me be!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air

<P>was tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such

<P>a mood before, and it rather bewildered him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following

<P>her as she walked away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I do.&nbsp; I don't want to be worried about such things.

<P>Father says I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by?&nbsp; I'll

<P>wait and say nothing till you have had more time.&nbsp; Don't play

<P>with me, Meg.&nbsp; I didn't think that of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't think of me at all.&nbsp; I'd rather you wouldn't," said

<P>Meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience

<P>and her own power.

<P>He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like

<P>the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his

<P>forehead nor tramped about the room as they did.&nbsp; He just stood

<P>looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her

<P>heart relenting in spite of herself.&nbsp; What would have happened

<P>next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at

<P>this interesting minute.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew,

<P>for she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of

<P>Mr. March's arrival, drove straight out to see him.&nbsp; The family

<P>were all busy in the back part of the house, and she had made

<P>her way quietly in, hoping to surprise them.&nbsp; She did surprise

<P>two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a

<P>ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless me, what's all this?" cried the old lady with a rap

<P>of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the

<P>scarlet young lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's Father's friend.&nbsp; I'm so surprised to see you!" stammered
Meg,

<P>feeling that she was in for a lecture now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's evident," returned Aunt March, sitting down.&nbsp; "But

<P>what is Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony?

<P>There's mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what it

<P>is," with another rap.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were only talking.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,"

<P>began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely

<P>out of the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Brooke?&nbsp; That boy's tutor?&nbsp; Ah! I understand now.&nbsp; I
know

<P>all about it.&nbsp; Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your

<P>Father's letters, and I made her tell me.&nbsp; You haven't gone and

<P>accepted him, child?" cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hush! He'll hear.&nbsp; Shan't I call Mother?" said Meg, much

<P>troubled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not yet.&nbsp; I've something to say to you, and I must free my

<P>mind at once.&nbsp; Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?&nbsp; If
you

<P>do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you.&nbsp; Remember that,

<P>and be a sensible girl," said the old lady impressively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing

<P>the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed

<P>doing it.&nbsp; The best of us have a spice of perversity in us,

<P>especially when we are young and in love.&nbsp; If Aunt March had

<P>begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have

<P>declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was preemptorily

<P>ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind that

<P>she would.&nbsp; Inclination as well as perversity made the decision

<P>easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady

<P>with unusual spirit.

<P>"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can

<P>leave your money to anyone you like," she said, nodding her

<P>head with a resolute air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Highty-tighty!&nbsp; Is that the way you take my advice, Miss?

<P>You'll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a

<P>cottage and found it a failure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It can't be a worse one than some people find in big

<P>houses," retorted Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl,

<P>for she did not know her in this new mood.&nbsp; Meg hardly knew

<P>herself, she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend

<P>John and assert her right to love him, if she liked.&nbsp; Aunt March

<P>saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a

<P>fresh start, saying as mildly as she could, "Now, Meg, my dear,

<P>be reasonable and take my advice.&nbsp; I mean it kindly, and don't

<P>want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the

<P>beginning.&nbsp; You ought to marry well and help your family.&nbsp;
It's

<P>your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed

<P>upon you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Father and Mother don't think so.&nbsp; They like John though

<P>he is poor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a

<P>pair of babies."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture.

<P>"This Rook is poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, but he has many warm friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll

<P>grow.&nbsp; He hasn't any business, has he?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not yet.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence is going to help him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That won't last long.&nbsp; James Laurence is a crotchety old

<P>fellow and not to be depended on.&nbsp; So you intend to marry a man

<P>without money, position, or business, and go on working harder

<P>than you do now, when you might be comfortable all your days

<P>by minding me and doing better?&nbsp; I thought you had more sense,

<P>Meg."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I couldn't do better if I waited half my life!&nbsp; John is

<P>good and wise, he's got heaps of talent, he's willing to work

<P>and sure to get on, he's so energetic and brave.&nbsp; Everyone likes

<P>and respects him, and I'm proud to think he cares for me, though

<P>I'm so poor and young and silly," said Meg, looking prettier than

<P>ever in her earnestness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He knows you have got rich relations, child.&nbsp; That's the

<P>secret of his liking, I suspect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing?&nbsp; John is above

<P>such meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,"

<P>cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of

<P>the old lady's suspicions.&nbsp; "My John wouldn't marry for money,
any

<P>more than I would.&nbsp; We are willing to work and we mean to wait.&nbsp;
I'm

<P>not afraid of being poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I

<P>shall be with him because he loves me, and I..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't

<P>made up her mind, that she had told `her John' to go away, and that

<P>he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having

<P>her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's

<P>happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair!&nbsp; You are a willful

<P>child, and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly.

<P>No, I won't stop.&nbsp; I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits
to

<P>see your father now.&nbsp; Don't expect anything from me when you are

<P>married.&nbsp; Your Mr. Book's friends must take care of you.&nbsp;
I'm done

<P>with you forever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in

<P>high dudgeon.&nbsp; She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her,

<P>for when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to

<P>laugh or cry.&nbsp; Before she could make up her mind, she was taken

<P>possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, "I couldn't

<P>help hearing, Meg.&nbsp; Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March
for

<P>proving that you do care for me a little bit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't know how much till she abused you," began Meg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I needn't go away, but my stay and be happy, may I, dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech

<P>and the stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either,

<P>and disgraced herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering,

<P>"Yes,&nbsp; John," and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly

<P>downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no

<P>sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying

<P>to herself, "She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair

<P>is settled.&nbsp; I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over
it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon

<P>the threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with

<P>her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes.&nbsp; Going in to exult over

<P>a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the

<P>banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock

<P>to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the

<P>strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression
of

<P>the most abject submission.&nbsp; Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold

<P>shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected

<P>turning of the tables actually took her breath away.&nbsp; At the odd

<P>sound the lovers turned and saw her.&nbsp; Meg jumped up, looking both

<P>proud and shy, but `that man', as Jo called him, actually laughed

<P>and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, "Sister Jo,

<P>congratulate us!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much,

<P>and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished

<P>without a word.&nbsp; Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by

<P>exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room, "Oh, do somebody

<P>go down quick!&nbsp; John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes
it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself

<P>upon the be, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful

<P>news to Beth and Amy.&nbsp; The little girls, however, considered it
a

<P>most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from

<P>them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her

<P>troubles to the rats.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but

<P>a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his

<P>friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit,

<P>told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he

<P>wanted it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise

<P>which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper,

<P>both looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal.

<P>Amy was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth

<P>beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the

<P>young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly

<P>evident Aunt March was right in calling them as `unworldly as a pair

<P>of babies'.&nbsp; No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and
the

<P>old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of

<P>the family began there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?"

<P>said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch

<P>she was planning to make.

<P>"No, I'm sure I can't.&nbsp; How much has happened since I said that!

<P>It seems a year ago," answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream

<P>lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather

<P>think the changes have begun," said Mrs. March.&nbsp; "In most families

<P>there comes, now and then, a year full of events.&nbsp; This has been
such

<P>a one, but it ends well, after all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hope the next will end better," muttered Jo, who found it very

<P>hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved

<P>a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost

<P>or lessened in any way.

<P>"I hope the third year from this will end better.&nbsp; I mean it

<P>shall, if I live to work out my plans," said Mr. Brooke, smiling at

<P>Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?" asked Amy, who was in a

<P>hurry for the wedding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems

<P>a short time to me," answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face

<P>never seen there before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have only to wait, I am to do the work," said John beginning

<P>his labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which

<P>caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air

<P>of relief as the front door banged, "Here comes Laurie.&nbsp; Now we

<P>shall have some sensible conversation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing

<P>with good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for `Mrs.

<P>John Brooke', and evidently laboring under the delusion that the

<P>whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does,

<P>for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done

<P>though the sky falls," said Laurie, when he had presented his

<P>offering and his congratulations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Much obliged for that recommendation.&nbsp; I take it as a good

<P>omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,"

<P>answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his

<P>mischievous pupil.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll come if I'm at the ens of the earth, for the sight of

<P>Jo's face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey.

<P>You don't look festive, ma'am, what's the matter?" asked Laurie,

<P>following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned

<P>to greet Mr. Laurence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear

<P>it, and shall not say a word against it," said Jo solemnly.&nbsp; "You

<P>can't know how hard it is for me to give up Meg," she continued

<P>with a little quiver in her voice.

<P>"You don't give her up.&nbsp; You only go halves," said Laurie

<P>consolingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It can never be the same again.&nbsp; I've lost my dearest friend,"

<P>sighed Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You've got me, anyhow.&nbsp; I'm not good for much, I know, but

<P>I'll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life.&nbsp; Upon my word I
will!"

<P>And Laurie meant what he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged.&nbsp; You are always

<P>a great comfort to me, Teddy," returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.

<P>"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow.&nbsp; It's all

<P>right you see.&nbsp; Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled

<P>immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly

<P>to see Meg in her own little house.&nbsp; We'll have capital times after

<P>she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, and then

<P>we'll go abroad on some nice trip or other.&nbsp; Wouldn't that console
you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen

<P>in three years," said Jo thoughtfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's true.&nbsp; Don't you wish you could take a look forward and

<P>wee where we shall all be then?&nbsp; I do," returned Laurie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks

<P>so happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved." And Jo's

<P>eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the

<P>prospect was a pleasant one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first

<P>chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago.

<P>Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of

<P>their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the

<P>little artist could not copy.&nbsp; Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily

<P>with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it

<P>possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked.

<P>Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which

<P>best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his

<P>chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest

<P>aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.&nbsp; Whether it

<P>ever rises again, depends upon the reception giveN the first act of

<P>the domestic drama called LITTLE WOMEN.
