<P>Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck

<P>penny in her path.&nbsp; Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt

<P>if half a million would have given more real happiness then did

<P>the little sum that came to her in this wise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put

<P>on her scribbling suit, and `fall into a vortex', as she expressed

<P>it, writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till

<P>that was finished she could find no peace.&nbsp; Her `scribbling suit'

<P>consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her

<P>pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a

<P>cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were

<P>cleared for action.&nbsp; This cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes
of

<P>her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely

<P>popping in their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with interest,

<P>"Does genius burn, Jo?" They did not always venture even to ask

<P>this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged

<P>accordingly.&nbsp; If this expressive article of dress was drawn low

<P>upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on, in

<P>exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair

<P>seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the

<P>floor, and cast upon the floor.&nbsp; At such times the intruder silently

<P>withdrew, and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the

<P>gifted brow, did anyone dare address Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the

<P>writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon,

<P>and led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather,

<P>while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends

<P>almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh.&nbsp; Sleep forsook

<P>her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short to

<P>enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times, and made

<P>these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit.&nbsp; The

<P>devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged

<P>from her `vortex', hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was

<P>prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return

<P>for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea.&nbsp; It was a People's

<P>Course, the lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the

<P>choice of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for

<P>granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great
want

<P>supplied by unfolding the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience

<P>whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and whose

<P>lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the
Sphinx.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her

<P>stocking, Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who

<P>occupied the seat with them.&nbsp; On her left were two matrons, with

<P>massive foreheads and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and

<P>making tatting.&nbsp; Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly

<P>holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints
out

<P>of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap

<P>behind a yellow bandanna.&nbsp; On her right, her only neighbor was
a

<P>studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest

<P>her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances

<P>needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,

<P>tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two

<P>infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,

<P>were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying
away

<P>in the background with her mouth wide open.&nbsp; Pausing to turn a
page,

<P>the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half his

<P>paper, saying bluntly, "want to read it? That's a first-rate story."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her

<P>liking for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth

<P>of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of

<P>light literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the

<P>author's invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one

<P>half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over

<P>their downfall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Prime, isn't it?" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last

<P>paragraph of her portion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,"

<P>returned Jo, amused at his admiration of the trash.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.&nbsp; She makes

<P>a good living out of such stories, they say."&nbsp; And he pointed to
the

<P>name of Mrs. S.L.A.N.G.&nbsp; Northbury, under the title of the tale.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you know her?" asked Jo, with sudden interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in

<P>the office where this paper is printed."

<P>"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?"

<P>And Jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly

<P>sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Guess she does!&nbsp; She knows just what folks like, and gets paid

<P>well for writing it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while

<P>Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and

<P>hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,

<P>and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in

<P>its columns for a sensational story.&nbsp; By the time the lecture ended

<P>and the audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself

<P>(not the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the

<P>concoction of her story, being unable to decide whether the duel

<P>should come before the elopement or after the murder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>she said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day,

<P>much to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious

<P>when `genius took to burning'.&nbsp; Jo had never tried this style before,

<P>contenting herself with very mild romances for THE SPREAD EAGLE.&nbsp;
Her

<P>experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they

<P>gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language,

<P>and costumes.&nbsp; Her story was as full of desperation and despair
as her

<P>limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to

<P>make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an earthquake,

<P>as a striking and appropriate denouement.&nbsp; The manuscript was

<P>privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if

<P>the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,

<P>she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for

<P>a girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning

<P>to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again,

<P>when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away, for on

<P>opening it, a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap.&nbsp; For

<P>a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read

<P>her letter and began to cry.&nbsp; If the amiable gentleman who wrote

<P>that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was

<P>giving a fellow creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours,

<P>if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo valued the letter more than

<P>the money, because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it

<P>was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something, though

<P>it was only to write a sensation story.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having

<P>composed herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them

<P>with the letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that

<P>she had won the prize.&nbsp; Of course there was a great jubilee, and
when

<P>the story came everyone read and praised it, though after her father

<P>had told her that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty,

<P>and the tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his

<P>unworldly way...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can do better than this, Jo.&nbsp; Aim at the highest, and never

<P>mind the money."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think the money is the best part of it.&nbsp; What will you do with

<P>such a fortune?" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a

<P>reverential eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two," answered

<P>Jo promptly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth

<P>didn't come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much

<P>better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.&nbsp;
So Jo

<P>was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work

<P>with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks.

<P>She did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power

<P>in the house, for by the magic of a pen, her `rubbish' turned into

<P>comforts for them all.&nbsp; The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's
bill,

<P>A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys

<P>proved the blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its

<P>sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine

<P>satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the

<P>inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful

<P>blessings of the world.&nbsp; Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction,

<P>and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge

<P>that she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market,

<P>and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for

<P>fame and fortune.&nbsp; Having copied her novel for the fourth time,
read

<P>it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and

<P>trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition

<P>that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts

<P>which she particularly admired.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold,

<P>pay for printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get

<P>what I can for it.&nbsp; Fame is a very good thing to have in the house,

<P>but cash is more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting

<P>on this important subject," said Jo, calling a family council.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than

<P>you know, and the idea is well worked out.&nbsp; Let it wait and ripen,"

<P>was her father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having

<P>waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and

<P>being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial

<P>than by waiting," said Mrs. March.&nbsp; "Criticism is the best test
of

<P>such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults,

<P>and help her to do better next time.&nbsp; We are too partial, but the

<P>praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets

<P>but little money."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Jo, knitting her brows, "that's just it.&nbsp; I've been

<P>fussing over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good,

<P>bad, or indifferent.&nbsp; It will be a great help to have cool, impartial

<P>persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wouldn't leave a word out of it.&nbsp; You'll spoil it if you do,

<P>for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions

<P>of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you

<P>go on," said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most

<P>remarkable novel ever written.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But Mr. Allen says, `Leave out the explanations, make it brief

<P>and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story'," interrupted

<P>Jo, turning to the publisher's note.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do as he tells you.&nbsp; He knows what will sale, and we don't.

<P>Make a good, popular book, and get as much money as you can.

<P>By-and-by, when you've got a name, you can afford to digress,

<P>and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels,"

<P>said Amy, who took a strictly practical view of the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Jo, laughing, "if my people are `philosophical and

<P>metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such

<P>things, except what I hear father say;, sometimes.&nbsp; If I've got
some

<P>of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for

<P>me.&nbsp; Now, Beth, what do you say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should so like to see it printed soon," was all Beth said,

<P>and smiled in saying it.&nbsp; But there was an unconscious emphasis
on

<P>the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their

<P>childlike candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a

<P>forboding fear, and decided her to make her little venture `soon'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born

<P>on her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.&nbsp; In
the hope

<P>of pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man

<P>and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously

<P>got into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her

<P>doubts about it.&nbsp; Her mother thought that there was a trifle too
much

<P>description.&nbsp; Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary

<P>links in the story.&nbsp; Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the

<P>agony to suit her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the

<P>best intentions in life, Jo quenched the spritly scenes which

<P>relieved the somber character of the story.&nbsp; Then, to complicate

<P>the ruin, she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the

<P>poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into the big, busy

<P>world to try its fate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for

<P>it, likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than

<P>she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from

<P>which it took her some time to recover.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.&nbsp; But how can

<P>it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written

<P>a promising book or broken all the ten commandments?" cried poor

<P>Jo, turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her

<P>with pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.&nbsp; "This

<P>man says, `An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All is sweet, pure, and healthy.'" continued the perplexed

<P>authoress.&nbsp; "The next, `The theory of the book is bad, full of

<P>morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.'

<P>Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism,

<P>and copied my characters from life, I don't see how this critic can

<P>be right.&nbsp; Another says, `It's one of the best American novels
which

<P>has appeared for years.' (I know better than that), and the next

<P>asserts that `Though it is original, and written with great force

<P>and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't!&nbsp; Some make fun of
it,

<P>some overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to

<P>expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money.&nbsp;
I

<P>wish I'd printed the whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so

<P>misjudged."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation

<P>liberally.&nbsp; Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited
Jo,

<P>who meant so well and had apparently done so ill.&nbsp; But it did her

<P>good, for those whose opinion had real value gave her the critism

<P>which is an author's best education, and when the first soreness

<P>was over, she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in

<P>it still, and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting

<P>she had received.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me," she said

<P>stoutly, "and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts

<P>that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible

<P>and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head

<P>are pronounced `charmingly natural, tender, and true'.&nbsp; So I'll

<P>comfort myself with that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take

<P>another."
