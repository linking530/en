<P>"Come, Jo, it's time."

<P>"For what?"

<P>"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised

<P>to make half a dozen calls with me today?"
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life,

<P>but I don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls

<P>in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.&nbsp; I was to finish

<P>the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me,

<P>and return our neighbors' visits."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the

<P>letter of my bond, Shylock.&nbsp; There is a pile of clouds in the east,

<P>it's not fair, and I don't go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, that's shirking.&nbsp; It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain,

<P>and you pride yourself on keeping; promises, so be honorable, come

<P>and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking,

<P>for she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial

<P>credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen.

<P>It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon,

<P>and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day.

<P>She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy

<P>compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise.&nbsp; In the present

<P>instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors

<P>rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in,

<P>put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of

<P>resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint!&nbsp; You don't

<P>intend to make calls in that state, I hope," cried Amy, surveying

<P>her with amazement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why not?&nbsp; I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper

<P>for a dusty walk on a warm day.&nbsp; If people care more for my

<P>clothes than they do for me, I don't wish to see them.&nbsp; You can

<P>dress for both, and be as elegant as you please.&nbsp; It pays for

<P>you to be fine.&nbsp; It doesn't for me, and furbelows only worry me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear!" sighed Amy, "now she's in a contrary fit, and

<P>will drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready.

<P>I'm sure it's no pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we

<P>owe society, and there's no one to pay it but you and me.&nbsp; I'll

<P>do anything for you, Jo, if you'll only dress yourself nicely,

<P>and come and help me do the civil.&nbsp; You can talk so well, look

<P>so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully,

<P>if you try, that I'm proud of you.&nbsp; I'm afraid to go alone, do

<P>come and take care of me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your

<P>cross old sister in that way.&nbsp; The idea of my being aristocratic

<P>and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone!&nbsp; I

<P>don't know which is the most absurd.&nbsp; Well, I'll go if I must,

<P>and do my best.&nbsp; You shall be commander of the expedition, and

<P>I'll obey blindly, will that satisfy you?" said Jo, with a sudden

<P>change from perversity to lamblike submission.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're a perfect cherub!&nbsp; Now put on all your best things,

<P>and I'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will

<P>make a good impression.&nbsp; I want people to like you, and they

<P>would if you'd only try to be a little more agreeable.&nbsp; Do your

<P>hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet.&nbsp; It's

<P>becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit.&nbsp; Take your

<P>light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief.&nbsp; We'll stop at

<P>Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my

<P>dove-colored one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed

<P>them, not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed

<P>as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself

<P>as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow,

<P>wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar,

<P>wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief,

<P>whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission

<P>was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into

<P>tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch

<P>of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of

<P>countenance, saying meekly...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable,

<P>I die happy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're highly satisfactory.&nbsp; turn slowly round, and let me

<P>get a careful view."&nbsp; Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and

<P>there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously,

<P>"Yes, you'll do.&nbsp; Your head is all I could ask, for that

<P>white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing.&nbsp; Hold back your

<P>shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves

<P>do pinch.&nbsp; There's one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear
a

<P>shawl.&nbsp; I can't, but it's very nice to see you, and I'm so glad

<P>Aunt March gave you that lovely one.&nbsp; It's simple, but handsome,

<P>and those folds over the arm are really artistic.&nbsp; Is the point
of

<P>my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?&nbsp; I
like

<P>to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever," said Jo, looking

<P>through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather

<P>against the golden hair.&nbsp; "Am I to drag my best dress through the

<P>dust, or loop it up, please, ma'am?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hold it yup when you walk, but drop it in the house.&nbsp; The

<P>sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your

<P>skirts gracefully.&nbsp; You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at

<P>once.&nbsp; You'll never look finished if you are not careful about
the

<P>little details, for they make yup the pleasing whole."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove,

<P>in doing up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away,

<P>looking as `pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she hung out of the

<P>upper window to watch them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant

<P>people, so I want you to put on your best deportment.&nbsp; Don't make

<P>any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?&nbsp; Just
be

<P>calm, cool, and quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily

<P>do it for fifteen minutes," said Amy, as they approached the first

<P>place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg,

<P>with a baby on each arm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let me see.&nbsp; `Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can

<P>promise that.&nbsp; I've played the part of a prim young lady on the

<P>stage, and I'll try it off.&nbsp; My powers are great, as you shall
see,

<P>so be easy in your mind, my child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for

<P>during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed,

<P>every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank,

<P>and as silent as the sphinx.&nbsp; In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to

<P>her `charming novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties,

<P>picnics, the opera, and the fashions.&nbsp; Each and all were answered

<P>by a smile, a bow, and a demure "Yes" or "No" with the chill on.

<P>In vain Amy telegraphed the word `talk', tried to draw her out, and

<P>administered covert pokes with her foot.&nbsp; Jo sat as if blandly
unconcious

<P>of it all, with deportment like Maud's face, `icily regular, splendidly
null'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!"

<P>was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as

<P>the door closed upon their guests.&nbsp; Jo laughed noiselessly all

<P>through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her

<P>instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How could you mistake me so?&nbsp; I merely meant you to be properly

<P>dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and

<P>stone.&nbsp; Try to be sociable at the Lamb's'.&nbsp; Gossip as other
girls do,

<P>and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense

<P>comes up.&nbsp; They move in the best society, are valuable persons
for

<P>us to know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for

<P>anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll be agreeable.&nbsp; I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors

<P>and raptures over any trifle you like.&nbsp; I rather enjoy this, and

<P>now I'll imitate what is called `a charming girl'.&nbsp; I can do it,

<P>for I have May Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her.&nbsp;
See if

<P>the Lambs don't say, `What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish

<P>there was no knowing where she would stop.&nbsp; Amy's face was a

<P>study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss

<P>all the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young

<P>gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder.

<P>Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she

<P>was a favorite, and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia's

<P>last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near,

<P>waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her.&nbsp; So

<P>situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed possessed by

<P>a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady.&nbsp;
A

<P>knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear

<P>what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with curiosity,

<P>and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun.&nbsp;
One

<P>may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of

<P>conversation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She rides splendidly.&nbsp; who taught her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No one.&nbsp; She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and

<P>sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree.&nbsp; Now she rides anything,

<P>for she doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have

<P>horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well.&nbsp;
She

<P>has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails,

<P>she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for

<P>the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady,

<P>which was her especial aversion.&nbsp; But what could she do?&nbsp;
For the

<P>old lady was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done,

<P>Jo was off again, make more droll revelations and committing still

<P>more fearful blunders.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were

<P>gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so

<P>balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start.

<P>Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which did she choose?" asked one of the laughing gentlemen,

<P>who enjoyed the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"None of them.&nbsp; She heard of a young horse at the farm house

<P>over the river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved

<P>to try, because he was handsome and spirited.&nbsp; Her struggles

<P>were really pathetic.&nbsp; There was no one to bring the horse to the

<P>saddle, so she took the saddle to the horse.&nbsp; My dear creature,
she

<P>actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched

<P>up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did she ride the horse?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course she did, and had a capital time.&nbsp; I expected to see

<P>her brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and

<P>was the life of the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I call that plucky!"&nbsp; And young Mr. Lamb turned an approving

<P>glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make

<P>the girl look so red and uncomfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after,

<P>when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of

<P>dress.&nbsp; One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty

<P>drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning

<P>the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer

<P>with unnecessary frankness, "Oh, Amy painted it.&nbsp; You can't buy

<P>those soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like.&nbsp; It's a
great

<P>comfort to have an artistic sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Isn't that an original idea?" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances.

<P>There's nothing the child can't do.&nbsp; Why, she wanted a pair of
blue

<P>boots for Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones

<P>the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly

<P>like satin," added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments

<P>that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw
her

<P>cardcase at her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,"

<P>observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary

<P>lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Any mention of her `works' always had a bad effect upon Jo,

<P>who either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject

<P>with a brusque remark, as now.&nbsp; "Sorry you could find nothing better

<P>to read.&nbsp; I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people

<P>like it.&nbsp; Are you going to New York this winter?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Miss Lamb had `enjoyed' the story, this speech was not

<P>exactly grateful or complimentary.&nbsp; The minute it was made Jo saw

<P>her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered

<P>that it was for her to make the first move toward departure,

<P>and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half-

<P>finished sentences in their mouths.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Amy, we must go.&nbsp; Good-by, dear, do come and see us.&nbsp; We
are

<P>pining for a visit.&nbsp; I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if
you

<P>should come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's

<P>gushing style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible,

<P>feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't I do well?" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing could have been worse," was Amy's crushing reply.

<P>"What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and

<P>the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, it's funny, and amuses people.&nbsp; They know we are poor,

<P>so it's no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or

<P>four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and

<P>expose our; poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way.&nbsp; You haven't

<P>a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your

<P>tongue and when to speak," said Amy despairingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her

<P>nose with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for

<P>her misdemeanors.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How shall I behave here?" she asked, as they approached the

<P>third mansion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just as you please.&nbsp; I wash my hands of you," was Amy's short

<P>answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I'll enjoy myself.&nbsp; The boys are at home, and we'll have

<P>a comfortable time.&nbsp; Goodness knows I need a little change, for

<P>elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution," returned Jo gruffly,

<P>being disturbed by her failure to suit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty

<P>children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to

<P>entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling

<P>likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the

<P>change refreshing.&nbsp; She listened to college stories with deep interest,

<P>caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily

<P>that "Tom Brown was a brick," regardless of the improper form

<P>of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank,

<P>she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon her,

<P>as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous

<P>condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and dearer to

<P>her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired

<P>Frenchwoman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy

<P>herself to her heart's content.&nbsp; Mr. Tudor's uncle had married
an

<P>English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded

<P>the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American

<P>birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which

<P>haunts the best of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early

<P>faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun

<P>in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years

<P>ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young

<P>country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little

<P>mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell

<P>scolding when he rebelled.&nbsp; But even the satisfaction of talking
with

<P>a distant connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful

<P>of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she

<P>reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked

<P>about for Jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not

<P>be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of
March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.&nbsp; For Jo

<P>sat on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a

<P>dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress,

<P>as she related one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience.&nbsp;
One

<P>small child was poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second

<P>was eating gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing

<P>ball with her gloves.&nbsp; but all were enjoying themselves, and when
Jo

<P>collected her damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her,

<P>begging her to come again, "It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Capital boys, aren't they?&nbsp; I feel quite young and brisk again

<P>after that." said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her,

<P>partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?" asked Amy, wisely refraining

<P>from any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries

<P>his father, a nd doesn't speak respectfully of his mother.&nbsp; Laurie

<P>says he is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance,

<P>so I let him alone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You might treat him civilly, at least.&nbsp; You gave him a cool

<P>nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to

<P>Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store.&nbsp; If you

<P>had just reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right,"

<P>said Amy reprovingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it wouldn't," returned Jo, "I neither like, respect, nor

<P>admire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was

<P>a third cousin to a lord.&nbsp; Tommy is poor and bashful and good and

<P>very clever.&nbsp; I think well of him, and like to show that I do,
for

<P>he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's no use trying to argue with you," began Amy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not the least, my dear," interrupted Jo, "so let us look

<P>amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out,

<P>for which I'm deeply grateful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked

<P>on, and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth

<P>house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.&nbsp; We

<P>can run down there any time, and it's really a pity to trail

<P>through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are

<P>tired and cross."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Speak for yourself, if you please.&nbsp; Aunt March likes to have us

<P>pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call.

<P>It's a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't

<P>believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs

<P>and clumping boys spoil them.&nbsp; Stoop down, and let me take the

<P>crumbs off of your bonnet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a good girl you are, Amy!" said Jo, with a repentant

<P>glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which

<P>was fresh and spotless still.&nbsp; "I wish it was as easy for me to
do

<P>little things to please people as it is for you.&nbsp; I think of them,

<P>but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance to

<P>confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell

<P>best in the end, I fancy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal

<P>air, "Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones,

<P>for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive.

<P>If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked

<P>than I am, because there is more of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm

<P>willing to own that you are right, only it's easier for me to

<P>risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don't

<P>feel like it.&nbsp; It's a great misfortune to have such strong likes

<P>and dislikes, isn't it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a greater not to be able to hide them.&nbsp; I don't mind

<P>saying that I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm

<P>not called upon to tell him so.&nbsp; Neither are you, and there is
no

<P>use in making yourself disagreeable because he is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of

<P>young men, and how can they do it except by their manners?

<P>Preaching does not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've

<P>had Teddie to manage.&nbsp; But there are many little ways in which
I can

<P>influence him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others

<P>if we can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample

<P>of other boys," said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which

<P>would have convulsed the `remarkable boy' if he had heard it.&nbsp;
"If

<P>we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something,

<P>perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because

<P>we don't approve of them, and smile upon another set because

<P>we do, wouldn't have a particle of effect, and we should

<P>only be considered odd and puritanical."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest,

<P>merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we?

<P>That's a nice sort of morality."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of

<P>the world, and people who set themselves against it only get

<P>laughed at for their pains.&nbsp; I don't like reformers, and I hope

<P>you never try to be one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of

<P>the laughing the world would never get on without them.&nbsp; We can't

<P>agree about that.&nbsp; for you belong to the old set, and I to the
new.

<P>You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it.

<P>I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your

<P>new ideas."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with

<P>some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before

<P>her.&nbsp; It's my doom, and I can't help it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in

<P>some very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls

<P>came in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been

<P>talking about their nieces.&nbsp; Jo was not in a good humor, and the

<P>perverse fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty,

<P>kept her temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame

<P>of mind.&nbsp; This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts
`my

<P>deared' her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically,

<P>"That child improves every day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol,

<P>as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like

<P>so well in the young.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Aunt.&nbsp; Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to

<P>tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly.&nbsp; "I hate to be patronized, and

<P>the Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their

<P>highly connected fair.&nbsp; I wonder you consented, Amy, they only
want

<P>you to work."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am willing to work.&nbsp; It's for the freedmen as well as the

<P>Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the

<P>labor and the fun.&nbsp; Patronage does not trouble me when it is well

<P>meant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite right and proper.&nbsp; I like your grateful spirit, my dear.

<P>It's a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.&nbsp; Some
do

<P>not, and that is trying," observed Aunt March, looking over her

<P>spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat

<P>morose expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in

<P>the balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a

<P>minute, but unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts,

<P>and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends.&nbsp; Better

<P>for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it

<P>would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper.&nbsp; By
her

<P>next speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and

<P>received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a

<P>slave.&nbsp; I'd rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly

<P>independent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ahem!" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I told you so," said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in

<P>the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you speak French, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to

<P>me as often as I like," replied amy, with a grateful look, which

<P>caused the old lady to smile affably.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How are you about languages?" asked Mrs. Carrol of JO.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't know a word.&nbsp; I'm very stupid about studying anything,

<P>can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,"

<P>was the brusque reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said

<P>to Amy, 'You are quite strong and well no, dear, I believe?&nbsp; Eyes

<P>don't trouble you any more, do they?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all, thank you, ma'am.&nbsp; I'm very well, and mean to do

<P>great things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever

<P>that joyful time arrives."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good girl!&nbsp; You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some

<P>day," said Aunt March, with an approving; pat on the head, as Amy

<P>picked up her ball for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crosspatch, draw the latch,

<P>Sit by the fire and spin,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her

<P>chair to peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent

<P>inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Most observing bird," said the old lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come and take a walk, my dear?" cried Polly, hopping toward

<P>the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, I will.&nbsp; Come Amy."&nbsp; And Jo brought the visit
to

<P>an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad

<P>effect upon her constitution.&nbsp; She shook hands in a gentlemanly

<P>manner, but Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed,

<P>leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine, which

<P>impression caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You'd better do it, Mary.&nbsp; I'll supply the money.&nbsp; And Aunt

<P>Carrol to reply decidedly, "I certainly will, if her father and

<P>mother consent."
