<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself.&nbsp; It was no longer in Emma's

<P>power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.

<P>The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand,

<P>that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth

<P>her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay

<P>at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--

<P>that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could

<P>be afforded by her to the lovers.&nbsp; They might advance rapidly

<P>if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether

<P>they would or no.&nbsp; She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.

<P>There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will

<P>do for themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual

<P>absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the

<P>usual interest.&nbsp; Till this year, every long vacation since their

<P>marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;

<P>but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing

<P>for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had

<P>been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all

<P>by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,

<P>even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most

<P>nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a

<P>little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to

<P>bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms

<P>were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,

<P>and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent

<P>number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.

<P>The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,

<P>welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,

<P>produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne

<P>under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;

<P>but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were

<P>so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal

<P>solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,

<P>and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,

<P>all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,

<P>which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,

<P>the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,

<P>either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,

<P>quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;

<P>wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,

<P>and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for

<P>these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.

<P>She could never see a fault in any of them.&nbsp; She was not a woman

<P>of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance

<P>of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;

<P>was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,

<P>had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield

<P>in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.&nbsp; They were alike too,

<P>in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard

<P>for every old acquaintance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;

<P>rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his

<P>private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being

<P>generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.

<P>He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross

<P>as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his

<P>great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,

<P>it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not

<P>be increased.&nbsp; The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.

<P>He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,

<P>and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing

<P>wrong in him escaped her.&nbsp; She was quick in feeling the little

<P>injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.

<P>Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been

<P>flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly

<P>kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;

<P>but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her

<P>regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes

<P>fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.

<P>There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.

<P>Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking

<P>him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.

<P>It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great

<P>regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was

<P>due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as

<P>there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,

<P>though the offence came not.&nbsp; The beginning, however, of every
visit

<P>displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity

<P>so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.

<P>They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's

<P>attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, my dear," said he, "poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must

<P>miss her!&nbsp; And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--

<P>I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could

<P>possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope

<P>she is pretty well, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know

<P>but that the place agrees with her tolerably."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any

<P>doubts of the air of Randalls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no--none in the least.&nbsp; I never saw Mrs. Weston better in
my life--

<P>never looking so well.&nbsp; Papa is only speaking his own regret."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella

<P>in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since

<P>they married.&nbsp; Either in the morning or evening of every day,

<P>excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,

<P>and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you

<P>may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.&nbsp; They are very,

<P>very kind in their visits.&nbsp; Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.

<P>Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving

<P>Isabella a false idea of us all.&nbsp; Every body must be aware that
Miss

<P>Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured

<P>that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any

<P>means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as I hoped

<P>it was from your letters.&nbsp; Her wish of shewing you attention could

<P>not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it

<P>all easy.&nbsp; I have been always telling you, my love, that I had
no idea

<P>of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;

<P>and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse--"yes, certainly--I cannot deny

<P>that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--

<P>but then--she is always obliged to go away again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--

<P>You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr. Weston

<P>has some little claim.&nbsp; You and I, Emma, will venture to take the
part

<P>of the poor husband.&nbsp; I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,

<P>the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.

<P>As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience

<P>of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--

<P>"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,

<P>a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been

<P>for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought

<P>of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;

<P>and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think

<P>there is nothing he does not deserve.&nbsp; I believe he is one of the

<P>very best-tempered men that ever existed.&nbsp; Excepting yourself

<P>and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.&nbsp; I shall

<P>never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day

<P>last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September

<P>twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,

<P>on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,

<P>I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor

<P>a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be

<P>Miss Taylor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley.&nbsp; "Has he been here

<P>on this occasion--or has he not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He has not been here yet," replied Emma.&nbsp; "There was a strong

<P>expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended

<P>in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her father.

<P>"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,

<P>and a very proper, handsome letter it was.&nbsp; She shewed it to me.

<P>I thought it very well done of him indeed.&nbsp; Whether it was his
own idea

<P>you know, one cannot tell.&nbsp; He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--

<P>and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!&nbsp; Well,

<P>time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.&nbsp; However, it
was

<P>an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston

<P>a great deal of pleasure.&nbsp; I remember it was written from Weymouth,

<P>and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget

<P>how it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'--

<P>I remember that perfectly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John

<P>Knightley.&nbsp; "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young
man.

<P>But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!

<P>There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his

<P>parents and natural home!&nbsp; I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston

<P>could part with him.&nbsp; To give up one's child!&nbsp; I really never

<P>could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"

<P>observed Mr. John Knightley coolly.&nbsp; "But you need not imagine

<P>Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry

<P>or John.&nbsp; Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,

<P>than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,

<P>and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,

<P>much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,

<P>upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his

<P>neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any

<P>thing that home affords."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,

<P>and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let

<P>it pass.&nbsp; She would keep the peace if possible; and there was

<P>something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,

<P>the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's

<P>disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,

<P>and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.
