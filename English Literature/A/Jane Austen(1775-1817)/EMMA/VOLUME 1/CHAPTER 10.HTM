<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather

<P>to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;

<P>and on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor

<P>sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane

<P>leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street

<P>of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode

<P>of Mr. Elton.&nbsp; A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,

<P>and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,

<P>an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it

<P>could be.&nbsp; It had no advantage of situation; but had been very
much

<P>smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,

<P>there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without

<P>a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma's remark was--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There it is.&nbsp; There go you and your riddle-book one of these days."--

<P>Harriet's was--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow

<P>curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not often walk this way now," said Emma, as they proceeded,

<P>"but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get

<P>intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards

<P>of this part of Highbury."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,

<P>and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors

<P>and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,

<P>with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think

<P>of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want

<P>to inquire about of his housekeeper--no message from my father."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She pondered, but could think of nothing.&nbsp; After a mutual silence

<P>of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,

<P>or going to be married! so charming as you are!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma laughed, and replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;

<P>I must find other people charming--one other person at least.

<P>And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have

<P>very little intention of ever marrying at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,

<P>to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)

<P>is out of the question:&nbsp; and I do not wish to see any such person.

<P>I would rather not be tempted.&nbsp; I cannot really change for the
better.

<P>If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.

<P>Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!

<P>but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;

<P>and I do not think I ever shall.&nbsp; And, without love, I am sure
I

<P>should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.&nbsp; Fortune I

<P>do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want:

<P>I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their

<P>husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect

<P>to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always

<P>right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if
I

<P>thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--

<P>so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--

<P>and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,

<P>I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never

<P>can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is

<P>poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!

<P>A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,

<P>disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,

<P>but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,

<P>and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.&nbsp; And the

<P>distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common

<P>sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income

<P>has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.

<P>Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,

<P>and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.

<P>This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good

<P>natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very

<P>much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.

<P>Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:&nbsp; I really believe,

<P>if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely

<P>to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:&nbsp; that
is a

<P>great charm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself

<P>when you grow old?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great

<P>many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be

<P>more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.

<P>Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then

<P>as they are now; or with no important variation.&nbsp; If I draw less,

<P>I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.

<P>And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,

<P>which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which

<P>is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall

<P>be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,

<P>to care about.&nbsp; There will be enough of them, in all probability,

<P>to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.

<P>There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my

<P>attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas

<P>of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.&nbsp; My nephews

<P>and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you know Miss Bates's niece?&nbsp; That is, I know you must have

<P>seen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes

<P>to Highbury.&nbsp; By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out

<P>of conceit with a niece.&nbsp; Heaven forbid! at least, that I should

<P>ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,

<P>as she does about Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; One is sick of the very name

<P>of Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; Every letter from her is read forty times over;

<P>her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she

<P>does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair

<P>of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.

<P>I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics

<P>were superseded.&nbsp; Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses

<P>of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention

<P>and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.

<P>She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and

<P>their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary

<P>virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into

<P>their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance

<P>with as much intelligence as good-will.&nbsp; In the present instance,

<P>it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;

<P>and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,

<P>she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene

<P>as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.&nbsp; How trifling they

<P>make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of

<P>nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,

<P>who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true," said Harriet.&nbsp; "Poor creatures! one can think

<P>of nothing else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,"

<P>said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep

<P>which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,

<P>and brought them into the lane again.&nbsp; "I do not think it will,"

<P>stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,

<P>and recall the still greater within.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! dear, no," said her companion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They walked on.&nbsp; The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend

<P>was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near

<P>as to give Emma time only to say farther,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability

<P>in good thoughts.&nbsp; Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that

<P>if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,

<P>it has done all that is truly important.&nbsp; If we feel for the wretched,

<P>enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,

<P>only distressing to ourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentleman

<P>joined them.&nbsp; The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,

<P>were the first subject on meeting.&nbsp; He had been going to call

<P>on them.&nbsp; His visit he would now defer; but they had a very

<P>interesting parley about what could be done and should be done.

<P>Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thought Emma;

<P>"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase

<P>of love on each side.&nbsp; I should not wonder if it were to bring

<P>on the declaration.&nbsp; It must, if I were not here.&nbsp; I wish
I were

<P>anywhere else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon

<P>afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised

<P>on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.

<P>But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's

<P>habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,

<P>in short, they would both be soon after her.&nbsp; This would not do;

<P>she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration

<P>to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete

<P>occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk
on,

<P>and she would follow in half a minute.&nbsp; They did as they were desired;

<P>and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,

<P>she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken

<P>by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,

<P>with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.&nbsp; To walk by the
side

<P>of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural

<P>thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been

<P>acting just then without design; and by this means the others were

<P>still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.

<P>She gained on them, however, involuntarily:&nbsp; the child's pace was
quick,

<P>and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,

<P>from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.

<P>Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very

<P>pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning

<P>to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both

<P>looked around, and she was obliged to join them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;

<P>and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he

<P>was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's

<P>party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for

<P>the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,

<P>the beet-root, and all the dessert.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This would soon have led to something better, of course," was her

<P>consoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who love;

<P>and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.

<P>If I could but have kept longer away!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage

<P>pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into

<P>the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,

<P>and fall behind to arrange it once more.&nbsp; She then broke the lace

<P>off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently

<P>obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to

<P>put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am

<P>to contrive.&nbsp; I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,

<P>but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg

<P>leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit

<P>of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing

<P>could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into

<P>his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.

<P>The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,

<P>and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately

<P>communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed

<P>into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most

<P>comfortable manner.&nbsp; She was obliged to leave the door ajar as
she

<P>found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.

<P>It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging

<P>the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it

<P>practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.

<P>For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.&nbsp; It could

<P>be protracted no longer.&nbsp; She was then obliged to be finished,

<P>and make her appearance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.&nbsp; It had
a

<P>most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory

<P>of having schemed successfully.&nbsp; But it would not do; he had not

<P>come to the point.&nbsp; He had been most agreeable, most delightful;

<P>he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely

<P>followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,

<P>but nothing serious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch,

<P>and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished

<P>by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself

<P>that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,

<P>and must be leading them forward to the great event.
