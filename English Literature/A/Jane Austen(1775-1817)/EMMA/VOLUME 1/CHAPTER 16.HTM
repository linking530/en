<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think

<P>and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow

<P>of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every

<P>thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst

<P>of all.&nbsp; Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some
sort

<P>or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;

<P>and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--

<P>more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was,

<P>could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have

<P>borne any thing.&nbsp; He might have doubled his presumption to me--

<P>but poor Harriet!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he

<P>had never thought seriously of Harriet--never!&nbsp; She looked back

<P>as well as she could; but it was all confusion.&nbsp; She had taken

<P>up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.

<P>His manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious,

<P>or she could not have been so misled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--

<P>and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--

<P>how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet.&nbsp; To be sure,

<P>the charade, with its "ready wit"--but then the "soft eyes"--

<P>in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.

<P>Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners

<P>to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,

<P>as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof

<P>among others that he had not always lived in the best society,

<P>that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance

<P>was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,

<P>for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect

<P>to her as Harriet's friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on

<P>the subject, for the first start of its possibility.&nbsp; There was

<P>no denying that those brothers had penetration.&nbsp; She remembered

<P>what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution

<P>he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would

<P>never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer

<P>a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she

<P>had reached herself.&nbsp; It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton

<P>was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she

<P>had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full

<P>of his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting

<P>to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion.

<P>His professions and his proposals did him no service.&nbsp; She thought

<P>nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.

<P>He wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his

<P>eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy

<P>as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.

<P>There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.

<P>Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could

<P>hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,

<P>less allied with real love.&nbsp; She need not trouble herself to pity
him.

<P>He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse

<P>of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite

<P>so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss

<P>Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as

<P>aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),

<P>to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion

<P>or mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the

<P>gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,

<P>as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!--

<P>It was most provoking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he

<P>was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.

<P>The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;

<P>but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly

<P>his superior.&nbsp; He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled

<P>for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch

<P>of a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.

<P>The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,

<P>being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all

<P>the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources,

<P>was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself,

<P>in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long

<P>held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which

<P>Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way

<P>as he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing

<P>to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.--

<P>But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must

<P>have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the

<P>seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head,

<P>Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own

<P>behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of

<P>courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived)

<P>might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy,

<P>like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.&nbsp;
If she

<P>had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder

<P>that he, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first error and the worst lay at her door.&nbsp; It was foolish,

<P>it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two

<P>people together.&nbsp; It was adventuring too far, assuming too much,

<P>making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought

<P>to be simple.&nbsp; She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved

<P>to do such things no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here have I," said she, "actually talked poor Harriet into being

<P>very much attached to this man.&nbsp; She might never have thought of
him

<P>but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope,

<P>if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest

<P>and humble as I used to think him.&nbsp; Oh! that I had been satisfied
with

<P>persuading her not to accept young Martin.&nbsp; There I was quite right.

<P>That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left

<P>the rest to time and chance.&nbsp; I was introducing her into good company,

<P>and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having;

<P>I ought not to have attempted more.&nbsp; But now, poor girl, her peace

<P>is cut up for some time.&nbsp; I have been but half a friend to her;

<P>and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am

<P>sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable

<P>for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--

<P>a pert young lawyer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed

<P>a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been,

<P>and might be, and must be.&nbsp; The distressing explanation she had

<P>to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering,

<P>with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of

<P>continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,

<P>concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy

<P>her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went

<P>to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having

<P>blundered most dreadfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under

<P>temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail

<P>to bring return of spirits.&nbsp; The youth and cheerfulness of morning

<P>are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the

<P>distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they

<P>will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had

<P>gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,

<P>and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really

<P>in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking

<P>to disappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that

<P>superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--

<P>and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing

<P>what had passed except the three principals, and especially

<P>for her father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal

<P>of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was

<P>welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder

<P>at present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day,

<P>she could not go to church.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable

<P>had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from

<P>either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.

<P>The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled

<P>state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most

<P>unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow,

<P>and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most

<P>honourable prisoner.&nbsp; No intercourse with Harriet possible but
by note;

<P>no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no

<P>need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;

<P>and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort

<P>in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father

<P>so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,

<P>too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no

<P>weather could keep entirely from them,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr.
Elton?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These days of confinement would have been, but for her private

<P>perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly

<P>suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance

<P>to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off

<P>his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him

<P>during the rest of his stay at Hartfield.&nbsp; He was always agreeable

<P>and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.&nbsp; But with
all

<P>the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay,

<P>there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation

<P>with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at
ease.
