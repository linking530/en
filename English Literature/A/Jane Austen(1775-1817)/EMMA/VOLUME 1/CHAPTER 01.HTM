<P><B>CHAPTER I</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home

<P>and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings

<P>of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world

<P>with very little to distress or vex her.

<P>She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,

<P>indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,

<P>been mistress of his house from a very early period.&nbsp; Her mother

<P>had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct

<P>remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied

<P>by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short

<P>of a mother in affection.

<P>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,

<P>less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,

<P>but particularly of Emma.&nbsp; Between them it was more the intimacy

<P>of sisters.&nbsp; Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal

<P>office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed

<P>her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being

<P>now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and

<P>friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;

<P>highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by

<P>her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having

<P>rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little

<P>too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened

<P>alloy to her many enjoyments.&nbsp; The danger, however, was at present

<P>so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes

<P>with her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any

<P>disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.&nbsp; It was Miss

<P>Taylor's loss which first brought grief.&nbsp; It was on the wedding-day

<P>of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought

<P>of any continuance.&nbsp; The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,

<P>her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect

<P>of a third to cheer a long evening.&nbsp; Her father composed himself

<P>to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit

<P>and think of what she had lost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.&nbsp; Mr. Weston

<P>was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,

<P>and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering

<P>with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished

<P>and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.

<P>The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.

<P>She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen

<P>years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five

<P>years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse

<P>her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses

<P>of childhood.&nbsp; A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the

<P>intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect

<P>unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their

<P>being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.

<P>She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,

<P>well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,

<P>interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,

<P>in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak

<P>every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her

<P>as could never find fault.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was

<P>going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must

<P>be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,

<P>and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,

<P>natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering

<P>from intellectual solitude.&nbsp; She dearly loved her father, but he

<P>was no companion for her.&nbsp; He could not meet her in conversation,

<P>rational or playful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had

<P>not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;

<P>for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity

<P>of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;

<P>and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart

<P>and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him

<P>at any time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,

<P>being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond

<P>her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must

<P>be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next

<P>visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,

<P>to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,

<P>to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,

<P>and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.&nbsp; The Woodhouses

<P>were first in consequence there.&nbsp; All looked up to them.&nbsp;
She had

<P>many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,

<P>but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss

<P>Taylor for even half a day.&nbsp; It was a melancholy change; and Emma

<P>could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,

<P>till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.

<P>His spirits required support.&nbsp; He was a nervous man, easily depressed;

<P>fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;

<P>hating change of every kind.&nbsp; Matrimony, as the origin of change,

<P>was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled

<P>to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but

<P>with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,

<P>when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from

<P>his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to

<P>suppose that other people could feel differently from himself,

<P>he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad

<P>a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal

<P>happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.

<P>Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him

<P>from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him

<P>not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.&nbsp; What a pity it

<P>is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.&nbsp; Mr. Weston
is such

<P>a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves

<P>a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us

<P>for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of
her own?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?

<P>This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,

<P>my dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see

<P>us!--We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay

<P>wedding visit very soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.

<P>I could not walk half so far."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.&nbsp; We must go in the carriage,

<P>to be sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for

<P>such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we

<P>are paying our visit?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.&nbsp; You know we

<P>have settled all that already.&nbsp; We talked it all over with Mr.
Weston

<P>last night.&nbsp; And as for James, you may be very sure he will always
like

<P>going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.

<P>I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.&nbsp; That
was

<P>your doing, papa.&nbsp; You got Hannah that good place.&nbsp; Nobody
thought

<P>of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very glad I did think of her.&nbsp; It was very lucky, for I would

<P>not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;

<P>and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,

<P>pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.&nbsp; Whenever I
see her,

<P>she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;

<P>and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she

<P>always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.

<P>I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great

<P>comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is

<P>used to see.&nbsp; Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you
know,

<P>she will be hearing of us.&nbsp; He will be able to tell her how we

<P>all are."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,

<P>and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably

<P>through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.

<P>The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards

<P>walked in and made it unnecessary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not

<P>only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly

<P>connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.

<P>He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,

<P>and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,

<P>as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.&nbsp; He
had

<P>returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked

<P>up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.

<P>It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.

<P>Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;

<P>and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her children were

<P>answered most satisfactorily.&nbsp; When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse

<P>gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come

<P>out at this late hour to call upon us.&nbsp; I am afraid you must have

<P>had a shocking walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all, sir.&nbsp; It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild

<P>that I must draw back from your great fire."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.&nbsp; I wish you may

<P>not catch cold."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.&nbsp; Not a speck on them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal

<P>of rain here.&nbsp; It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour

<P>while we were at breakfast.&nbsp; I wanted them to put off the wedding."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.&nbsp; Being pretty well aware

<P>of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry

<P>with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.

<P>How did you all behave? Who cried most?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly

<P>say `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma;

<P>but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At

<P>any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"

<P>said Emma playfully.&nbsp; "That is what you have in your head,

<P>I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>with a sigh.&nbsp; "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose

<P>Mr. Knightley to mean you.&nbsp; What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant

<P>only myself.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--

<P>in a joke--it is all a joke.&nbsp; We always say what we like to one
another."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see

<P>faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:

<P>and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,

<P>she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would

<P>not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being

<P>thought perfect by every body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I

<P>meant no reflection on any body.&nbsp; Miss Taylor has been used

<P>to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.

<P>The chances are that she must be a gainer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass--"you want to hear

<P>about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all

<P>behaved charmingly.&nbsp; Every body was punctual, every body in their

<P>best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.&nbsp; Oh
no;

<P>we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,

<P>and were sure of meeting every day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father.

<P>"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,

<P>and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.

<P>"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,"

<P>said Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; "We should not like her so well as we do,
sir,

<P>if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to

<P>Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,

<P>at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,

<P>and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,

<P>and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.

<P>Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily

<P>married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma,

<P>"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.

<P>I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,

<P>and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would

<P>never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.&nbsp; Her father fondly replied,

<P>"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,

<P>for whatever you say always comes to pass.&nbsp; Pray do not make any

<P>more matches."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,

<P>for other people.&nbsp; It is the greatest amusement in the world! And

<P>after such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would

<P>never marry again.&nbsp; Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower

<P>so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,

<P>so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his

<P>friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--

<P>Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did

<P>not like it.&nbsp; Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.

<P>Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,

<P>and others of the son and the uncle not letting him.&nbsp; All manner

<P>of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none

<P>of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I

<P>met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,

<P>he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas

<P>for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.

<P>I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed

<P>me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave

<P>off match-making."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not understand what you mean by `success,'" said Mr. Knightley.

<P>"Success supposes endeavour.&nbsp; Your time has been properly and

<P>delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four

<P>years to bring about this marriage.&nbsp; A worthy employment for a
young

<P>lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,

<P>as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself

<P>one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor

<P>if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself

<P>every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where

<P>is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess;

<P>and that is all that can be said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--

<P>I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky

<P>guess is never merely luck.&nbsp; There is always some talent in it.

<P>And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not

<P>know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.&nbsp; You have drawn

<P>two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something

<P>between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's

<P>visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed

<P>many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.

<P>I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,

<P>unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their

<P>own concerns.&nbsp; You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,

<P>than good to them, by interference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"

<P>rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.&nbsp; "But, my dear,

<P>pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break
up

<P>one's family circle grievously."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Elton! You

<P>like Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him.

<P>There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been

<P>here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,

<P>that it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought

<P>when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if

<P>he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think

<P>very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing

<P>him a service."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very

<P>good young man, and I have a great regard for him.&nbsp; But if you

<P>want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come

<P>and dine with us some day.&nbsp; That will be a much better thing.

<P>I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley,

<P>laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much

<P>better thing.&nbsp; Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the
best

<P>of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.

<P>Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care

<P>of himself."
