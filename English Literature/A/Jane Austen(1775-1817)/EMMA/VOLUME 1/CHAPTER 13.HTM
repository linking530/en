<P>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John

<P>Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning

<P>among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking

<P>over what she had done every evening with her father and sister.

<P>She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass

<P>so swiftly.&nbsp; It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much
too short.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than

<P>their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out

<P>of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.

<P>Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls

<P>one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible

<P>thing in preference to a division of the party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty

<P>if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses

<P>were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than

<P>a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;

<P>nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one

<P>of the carriages find room for Harriet also.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,

<P>were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,

<P>as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination

<P>being consulted in every thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event

<P>that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been

<P>spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed

<P>with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed

<P>by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.

<P>Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed

<P>with regard to Randalls.&nbsp; She was very feverish and had a bad

<P>sore throat:&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr.
Perry

<P>was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist

<P>the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,

<P>though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's

<P>unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much

<P>Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her

<P>at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having

<P>a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.

<P>She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she

<P>was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as

<P>they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--

<P>of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going

<P>to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield--

<P>they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the

<P>daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,

<P>glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed

<P>to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they

<P>were hastening home for.&nbsp; They joined company and proceeded together.

<P>Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;--

<P>"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,

<P>a quick, low pulse, &amp;c.&nbsp; and she was sorry to find from Mrs.
Goddard

<P>that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often

<P>alarmed her with them."&nbsp; Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,

<P>as he exclaimed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious.&nbsp; I hope not of a putrid

<P>infectious sort.&nbsp; Has Perry seen her?&nbsp; Indeed you should take
care

<P>of yourself as well as of your friend.&nbsp; Let me entreat you to run

<P>no risks.&nbsp; Why does not Perry see her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this

<P>excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience

<P>and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness

<P>which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather

<P>feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite

<P>another subject,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much

<P>like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,

<P>I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father

<P>from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem

<P>to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it

<P>would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; But,
upon

<P>my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.

<P>You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider

<P>what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,

<P>I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home

<P>and take care of yourself to-night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;

<P>which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind

<P>care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of

<P>her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--

<P>but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions

<P>and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,

<P>was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its

<P>being "very cold, certainly very cold," and walked on, rejoicing in

<P>having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power

<P>of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You do quite right," said she;--"we will make your apologies

<P>to Mr. and Mrs. Weston."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly

<P>offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's

<P>only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much

<P>prompt satisfaction.&nbsp; It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,

<P>and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than

<P>at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes

<P>more exulting than when he next looked at her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said she to herself, "this is most strange!--After I

<P>had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave

<P>Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,

<P>in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--

<P>such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in

<P>the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,

<P>almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must

<P>be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young

<P>man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,

<P>he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.

<P>What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,

<P>but will not dine alone for her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him

<P>the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment

<P>in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his

<P>voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's

<P>for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared

<P>for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be

<P>able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself

<P>off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley

<P>began with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than

<P>Mr. Elton.&nbsp; It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.

<P>With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies

<P>to please, every feature works."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but where there

<P>is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook

<P>a great deal.&nbsp; Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,

<P>he will have the advantage over negligent superiority.&nbsp; There is

<P>such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot

<P>but value."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,

<P>"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you imagining

<P>me to be Mr. Elton's object?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never

<P>occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether

<P>it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.

<P>I think your manners to him encouraging.&nbsp; I speak as a friend,

<P>Emma.&nbsp; You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,

<P>and what you mean to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.&nbsp; Mr. Elton

<P>and I are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on,

<P>amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often

<P>arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes

<P>which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;

<P>and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind

<P>and ignorant, and in want of counsel.&nbsp; He said no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,

<P>that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea

<P>of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually

<P>with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent

<P>consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full

<P>of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at

<P>Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.

<P>The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage

<P>was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,

<P>and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only

<P>a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.

<P>The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice

<P>of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,

<P>which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated

<P>nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;

<P>and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in

<P>expressing his discontent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when

<P>he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such

<P>a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.&nbsp; He must think

<P>himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.

<P>It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--

<P>The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the

<P>folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can!

<P>If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of

<P>duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,

<P>probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward

<P>voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,

<P>which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,

<P>to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--

<P>here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another

<P>man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said

<P>and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.

<P>Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses

<P>and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,

<P>shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they

<P>might have had at home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no
doubt

<P>he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the "Very true, my love,"

<P>which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;

<P>but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer

<P>at all.&nbsp; She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;

<P>her heroism reached only to silence.&nbsp; She allowed him to talk,

<P>and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening

<P>her lips.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,

<P>and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.

<P>Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.&nbsp; Mr. Elton

<P>was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful

<P>in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have

<P>received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her.

<P>She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same--

<P>not better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My report from Mrs. Goddard's," said she presently, "was not

<P>so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was my answer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice

<P>of sentiment as he answered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that

<P>when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing

<P>before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,

<P>by no means better, rather worse.&nbsp; Very much grieved and concerned--

<P>I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial

<P>as I knew had been given her in the morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma smiled and answered--"My visit was of use to the nervous part

<P>of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;

<P>it is a most severe cold indeed.&nbsp; Mr. Perry has been with her,

<P>as you probably heard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow

<P>morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.&nbsp; But it is

<P>impossible not to feel uneasiness.&nbsp; Such a sad loss to our party
to-day!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;

<P>but it should have lasted longer.&nbsp; Emma was rather in dismay when

<P>only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,

<P>and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin

<P>for carriages.&nbsp; How very comfortable they make it;--impossible
to

<P>feel cold with such precautions.&nbsp; The contrivances of modern days

<P>indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete.

<P>One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath

<P>of air can find its way unpermitted.&nbsp; Weather becomes absolutely

<P>of no consequence.&nbsp; It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage

<P>we know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal

<P>of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton.&nbsp; "Quite seasonable;

<P>and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not

<P>begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very

<P>possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had

<P>there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.

<P>This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.&nbsp; At Christmas

<P>every body invites their friends about them, and people think little

<P>of even the worst weather.&nbsp; I was snowed up at a friend's house
once

<P>for a week.&nbsp; Nothing could be pleasanter.&nbsp; I went for only
one night,

<P>and could not get away till that very day se'nnight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,

<P>but said only, coolly,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too

<P>much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.

<P>Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are sure of excellent fires," continued he, "and every thing

<P>in the greatest comfort.&nbsp; Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--

<P>Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly

<P>what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--

<P>it will be a small party, but where small parties are select,

<P>they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.&nbsp; Mr. Weston's dining-room

<P>does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,

<P>I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than

<P>exceed by two.&nbsp; I think you will agree with me, (turning with a
soft

<P>air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,

<P>though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties

<P>of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine

<P>with any body."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the

<P>law had been so great a slavery.&nbsp; Well, sir, the time must come

<P>when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little

<P>labour and great enjoyment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed through

<P>the sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."
