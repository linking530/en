<P>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman

<P>as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must

<P>compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his

<P>ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,

<P>to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,

<P>and shew herself just as happy as she was.&nbsp; To her it was real

<P>enjoyment to be with the Westons.&nbsp; Mr. Weston was a great favourite,

<P>and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with

<P>such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related

<P>with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being

<P>always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,

<P>arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.

<P>She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not

<P>a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication

<P>of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private

<P>life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might

<P>not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;

<P>but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice

<P>was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as

<P>possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,

<P>and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through

<P>before her arrival.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long

<P>enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own

<P>and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed

<P>just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come

<P>and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston,

<P>who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,

<P>was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather

<P>sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was

<P>close to her.&nbsp; The difficulty was great of driving his strange

<P>insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat

<P>at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance

<P>on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.

<P>Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could

<P>not avoid the internal suggestion of "Can it really be as my brother

<P>imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer

<P>his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"--

<P>Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be

<P>so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston;

<P>and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal

<P>and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,

<P>and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.

<P>For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope

<P>that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;

<P>but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst

<P>the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense,

<P>which she particularly wished to listen to.&nbsp; She heard enough

<P>to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;

<P>she heard the words "my son," and "Frank," and "my son,"

<P>repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables

<P>very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from

<P>his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was

<P>so completely past that any reviving question from her would have

<P>been awkward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying,

<P>there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,

<P>which always interested her.&nbsp; She had frequently thought--especially
since

<P>his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she were to marry,

<P>he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.

<P>He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to
her.

<P>She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew

<P>them must think of.&nbsp; That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it,
she was

<P>very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,

<P>or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more

<P>replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great

<P>curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,

<P>of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure

<P>in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;

<P>but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling

<P>very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not

<P>possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,

<P>or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--

<P>for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,

<P>at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares

<P>of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,

<P>to say to her,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We want only two more to be just the right number.&nbsp; I should

<P>like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,

<P>and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.

<P>I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room

<P>that we are expecting Frank.&nbsp; I had a letter from him this morning,

<P>and he will be with us within a fortnight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented

<P>to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making

<P>their party quite complete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston,

<P>"ever since September:&nbsp; every letter has been full of it;

<P>but he cannot command his own time.&nbsp; He has those to please

<P>who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes

<P>to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.&nbsp; But now

<P>I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston

<P>is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost

<P>as happy as yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another

<P>put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do:

<P>but she does not know the parties so well as I do.&nbsp; The case,

<P>you see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:&nbsp; I did not mention

<P>a syllable of it in the other room.&nbsp; There are secrets in all families,

<P>you know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay

<P>a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon

<P>their being put off.&nbsp; If they are not put off, he cannot stir.

<P>But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,

<P>of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:

<P>and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or

<P>three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.

<P>I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.&nbsp; I am as confident

<P>of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am

<P>of being here myself:&nbsp; but your good friend there (nodding

<P>towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,

<P>and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot

<P>calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice

<P>of doing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"

<P>replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.&nbsp; If
you

<P>think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been

<P>at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow

<P>myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe

<P>her to be very fond of him.&nbsp; I used to think she was not capable

<P>of being fond of any body, except herself:&nbsp; but she has always
been

<P>kind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,

<P>and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit,

<P>in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;

<P>for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more

<P>heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,

<P>very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--

<P>yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--

<P>Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very

<P>glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting

<P>at the time talked of:&nbsp; "for I cannot depend upon his coming.

<P>I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.&nbsp; I am very much afraid

<P>that it will all end in nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been

<P>telling you exactly how the matter stands?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour

<P>of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain

<P>thing in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty

<P>of caprice?"&nbsp; Then turning to Isabella, who had not been

<P>attending before--"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,

<P>that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,

<P>in my opinion, as his father thinks.&nbsp; It depends entirely upon

<P>his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.

<P>To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.

<P>Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;

<P>and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,"

<P>replied Isabella:&nbsp; "and I am sure I never think of that poor young

<P>man without the greatest compassion.&nbsp; To be constantly living

<P>with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.&nbsp; It is what we

<P>happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life

<P>of misery.&nbsp; What a blessing, that she never had any children!

<P>Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She should then
have

<P>heard more:&nbsp; Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve

<P>which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,

<P>would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills

<P>from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own

<P>imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.

<P>But at present there was nothing more to be said.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse

<P>very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting

<P>long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.

<P>Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did

<P>he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity

<P>of saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any

<P>means certain.&nbsp; I am sorry for it.&nbsp; The introduction must
be unpleasant,

<P>whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.

<P>Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still

<P>afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.

<P>I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure

<P>there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.

<P>There is jealousy.&nbsp; They are jealous even of his regard for his
father.

<P>In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston

<P>were less sanguine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He ought to come," said Emma.&nbsp; "If he could stay only a couple

<P>of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's

<P>not having it in his power to do as much as that.&nbsp; A young woman,

<P>if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance

<P>from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young

<P>man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week

<P>with his father, if he likes it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,

<P>before one decides upon what he can do," replied Mrs. Weston.

<P>"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the

<P>conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe,

<P>I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:

<P>she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But she is so fond of the nephew:&nbsp; he is so very great a favourite.

<P>Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,

<P>that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,

<P>to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice

<P>towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,

<P>to whom she owes nothing at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,

<P>to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:&nbsp; you must

<P>let it go its own way.&nbsp; I have no doubt of his having, at times,

<P>considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him

<P>to know beforehand when it will be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied,

<P>unless he comes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,"

<P>continued Mrs. Weston, "and on others, very little:&nbsp; and among
those,

<P>on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be

<P>this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us."
