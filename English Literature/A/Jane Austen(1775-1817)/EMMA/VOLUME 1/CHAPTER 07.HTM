<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion

<P>for Emma's services towards her friend.&nbsp; Harriet had been at Hartfield,

<P>as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home

<P>to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been

<P>talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something

<P>extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.

<P>Half a minute brought it all out.&nbsp; She had heard, as soon as she
got

<P>back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,

<P>and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left

<P>a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;

<P>and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two

<P>songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;

<P>and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct

<P>proposal of marriage.&nbsp; "Who could have thought it? She was so surprized

<P>she did not know what to do.&nbsp; Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;

<P>and a very good letter, at least she thought so.&nbsp; And he wrote

<P>as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,

<P>she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she

<P>should do.--" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so

<P>pleased and so doubtful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to lose

<P>any thing for want of asking.&nbsp; He will connect himself well if
he can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet.&nbsp; "Pray do.&nbsp; I'd
rather

<P>you would."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was not sorry to be pressed.&nbsp; She read, and was surprized.

<P>The style of the letter was much above her expectation.

<P>There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it

<P>would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,

<P>was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much

<P>to the credit of the writer.&nbsp; It was short, but expressed good
sense,

<P>warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.

<P>She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for

<P>her opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add,

<P>"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly--"so

<P>good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of

<P>his sisters must have helped him.&nbsp; I can hardly imagine the young

<P>man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself

<P>so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the

<P>style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;

<P>not diffuse enough for a woman.&nbsp; No doubt he is a sensible man,

<P>and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and

<P>clearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find

<P>proper words.&nbsp; It is so with some men.&nbsp; Yes, I understand
the sort

<P>of mind.&nbsp; Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,

<P>not coarse.&nbsp; A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)

<P>than I had expected."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;--" well--and-- and what

<P>shall I do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard

<P>to this letter?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.&nbsp; You will

<P>express yourself very properly, I am sure.&nbsp; There is no danger
of your

<P>not being intelligible, which is the first thing.&nbsp; Your meaning
must

<P>be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude

<P>and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,

<P>will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded.

<P>You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow

<P>for his disappointment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you

<P>in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I

<P>have been under a mistake.&nbsp; I certainly have been misunderstanding

<P>you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer.

<P>I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was silent.&nbsp; With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would

<P>you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I

<P>ought to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.&nbsp; I will have nothing
to

<P>do with it.&nbsp; This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,

<P>contemplating the letter.&nbsp; For a little while Emma persevered

<P>in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery

<P>of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts

<P>as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought

<P>to refuse him.&nbsp; If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say

<P>`No' directly.&nbsp; It is not a state to be safely entered into

<P>with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.&nbsp; I thought it my duty

<P>as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you.

<P>But do not imagine that I want to influence you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you

<P>would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean

<P>that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should

<P>not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer

<P>to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I advise

<P>you either way.&nbsp; You must be the best judge of your own happiness.

<P>If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him

<P>the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should

<P>you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you

<P>at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not

<P>deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.

<P>At this moment whom are you thinking of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned

<P>away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though

<P>the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted

<P>about without regard.&nbsp; Emma waited the result with impatience,

<P>but not without strong hopes.&nbsp; At last, with some hesitation,

<P>Harriet said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must

<P>do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,

<P>and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.&nbsp; Do you

<P>think I am right?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just

<P>what you ought.&nbsp; While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings

<P>to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no

<P>hesitation in approving.&nbsp; Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.

<P>It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have

<P>been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.&nbsp; While you were
in

<P>the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would

<P>not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.

<P>I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.

<P>Now I am secure of you for ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck

<P>her forcibly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast.

<P>"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.

<P>That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,

<P>I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you

<P>for any thing in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;

<P>but it must have been.&nbsp; You would have thrown yourself out of all

<P>good society.&nbsp; I must have given you up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed

<P>me never to come to Hartfield any more!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear affectionate creature!--You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--You

<P>confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!

<P>I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.

<P>He must have a pretty good opinion of himself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said Harriet,

<P>her conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is very good natured,

<P>and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard

<P>for-- but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,

<P>though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and

<P>certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen

<P>people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,

<P>there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and agreeable.

<P>However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,

<P>and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached

<P>to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,

<P>it is what I would not do upon any consideration."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.&nbsp; We will not

<P>be parted.&nbsp; A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is
asked,

<P>or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a

<P>"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the

<P>clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,

<P>to know that her husband could write a good letter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, very.&nbsp; Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be
always

<P>happy with pleasant companions.&nbsp; I am quite determined to refuse
him.

<P>But how shall I do? That shall I say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,

<P>and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,

<P>in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest

<P>against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the

<P>formation of every sentence.&nbsp; The looking over his letter again,

<P>in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was

<P>particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;

<P>and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,

<P>and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,

<P>and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,

<P>that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,

<P>he would have been accepted after all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.

<P>The business was finished, and Harriet safe.&nbsp; She was rather low

<P>all the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,

<P>and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection,

<P>sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather

<P>a sorrowful tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.

<P>You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared

<P>to Abbey-Mill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy

<P>but at Hartfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very

<P>much surprized if she knew what had happened.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Nash

<P>would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,

<P>and it is only a linen-draper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the

<P>teacher of a school, Harriet.&nbsp; I dare say Miss Nash would envy
you

<P>such an opportunity as this of being married.&nbsp; Even this conquest

<P>would appear valuable in her eyes.&nbsp; As to any thing superior for
you,

<P>I suppose she is quite in the dark.&nbsp; The attentions of a certain

<P>person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.

<P>Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks

<P>and manners have explained themselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering

<P>that people should like her so much.&nbsp; The idea of Mr. Elton was

<P>certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted

<P>again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now he has got my letter," said she softly.&nbsp; "I wonder what they

<P>are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,

<P>they will be unhappy too.&nbsp; I hope he will not mind it so very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more

<P>cheerfully employed," cried Emma.&nbsp; "At this moment, perhaps, Mr.
Elton

<P>is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much

<P>more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five

<P>or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.&nbsp; No, my dear

<P>little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be

<P>in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.

<P>It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.

<P>It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,

<P>it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature,

<P>eager curiosity and warm prepossession.&nbsp; How cheerful, how animated,

<P>how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.
