<P>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.&nbsp; For some weeks past she

<P>had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually

<P>getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma

<P>judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her

<P>with them as much as possible just at present.&nbsp; She was obliged

<P>to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's,

<P>but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,

<P>to make a regular visit of some days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with

<P>Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made
up

<P>his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,

<P>and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples

<P>of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.

<P>Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering

<P>by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted

<P>apologies and civil hesitations of the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you

<P>will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take

<P>Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; As the sun

<P>is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.

<P>I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; We invalids think
we

<P>are privileged people."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.&nbsp; Emma will be
happy

<P>to entertain you.&nbsp; And therefore I think I will beg your excuse

<P>and take my three turns--my winter walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You cannot do better, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,

<P>but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;

<P>and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I

<P>think the sooner you go the better.&nbsp; I will fetch your greatcoat

<P>and open the garden door for you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being

<P>immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined

<P>for more chat.&nbsp; He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking

<P>of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a

<P>pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of

<P>her disposition.&nbsp; Her character depends upon those she is with;

<P>but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will

<P>tell you that you have improved her.&nbsp; You have cured her of her

<P>school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe
I

<P>had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow

<P>praise where they may.&nbsp; You do not often overpower me with it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Almost every moment.&nbsp; She has been gone longer already than

<P>she intended."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore

<P>said nothing.&nbsp; He presently added, with a smile,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you

<P>that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon

<P>hear of something to her advantage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love

<P>with her? Who makes you their confidant?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.

<P>Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew

<P>Mr. Elton looked up to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will

<P>soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable

<P>quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.&nbsp; Her visit to Abbey-Mill,

<P>this summer, seems to have done his business.&nbsp; He is desperately

<P>in love and means to marry her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet

<P>means to marry him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.&nbsp; Will that do? He
came

<P>to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.

<P>He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,

<P>I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.&nbsp; He came to
ask

<P>me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;

<P>whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his

<P>choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being

<P>considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line

<P>of society above him.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with all that he
said.

<P>I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.

<P>He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very

<P>well judging.&nbsp; He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,

<P>and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.&nbsp;
He is

<P>an excellent young man, both as son and brother.&nbsp; I had no hesitation

<P>in advising him to marry.&nbsp; He proved to me that he could afford
it;

<P>and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.

<P>I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.

<P>If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought

<P>highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the

<P>best friend and counsellor man ever had.&nbsp; This happened the night

<P>before last.&nbsp; Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow

<P>much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not

<P>appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should

<P>be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,

<P>without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to herself

<P>through a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martin

<P>did not speak yesterday?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly," replied he, surprized, "I do not absolutely know it;

<P>but it may be inferred.&nbsp; Was not she the whole day with you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what

<P>you have told me.&nbsp; He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,

<P>and was refused."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;

<P>and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,

<P>as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.

<P>What is the foolish girl about?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible

<P>to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.

<P>A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.&nbsp; But what is

<P>the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,

<P>if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.&nbsp; Emma, this is

<P>your doing.&nbsp; You persuaded her to refuse him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should

<P>not feel that I had done wrong.&nbsp; Mr. Martin is a very respectable

<P>young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am

<P>rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.

<P>By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.&nbsp; It is

<P>a pity that they were ever got over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;

<P>and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, he

<P>is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense

<P>as in situation.&nbsp; Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds
you.

<P>What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,

<P>to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural

<P>daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision

<P>at all, and certainly no respectable relations.&nbsp; She is known only

<P>as parlour-boarder at a common school.&nbsp; She is not a sensible girl,

<P>nor a girl of any information.&nbsp; She has been taught nothing useful,

<P>and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.

<P>At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,

<P>is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.

<P>She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.

<P>My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being

<P>beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.&nbsp; I felt that,

<P>as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that
as

<P>to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.

<P>But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing

<P>to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort

<P>of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led

<P>aright and turn out very well.&nbsp; The advantage of the match I felt

<P>to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)

<P>that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.

<P>Even your satisfaction I made sure of.&nbsp; It crossed my mind immediately

<P>that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the

<P>sake of her being settled so well.&nbsp; I remember saying to myself,

<P>`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a

<P>good match.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say

<P>any such thing.&nbsp; What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense
and all

<P>his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate

<P>friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying

<P>a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I

<P>wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.

<P>I assure you mine are very different.&nbsp; I must think your statement

<P>by no means fair.&nbsp; You are not just to Harriet's claims.

<P>They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;

<P>Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly

<P>her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves

<P>is much above his.--It would be a degradation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married

<P>to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense

<P>she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.

<P>She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below

<P>the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely

<P>be a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of

<P>fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged

<P>for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter,

<P>is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,

<P>no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whoever might be her parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever may

<P>have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part

<P>of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.

<P>After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in

<P>Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,

<P>in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance.

<P>Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was

<P>good enough.&nbsp; She desired nothing better herself.&nbsp; Till you
chose

<P>to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,

<P>nor any ambition beyond it.&nbsp; She was as happy as possible with
the

<P>Martins in the summer.&nbsp; She had no sense of superiority then.

<P>If she has it now, you have given it.&nbsp; You have been no friend
to

<P>Harriet Smith, Emma.&nbsp; Robert Martin would never have proceeded
so far,

<P>if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.

<P>I know him well.&nbsp; He has too much real feeling to address any

<P>woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.&nbsp; And as to conceit,

<P>he is the farthest from it of any man I know.&nbsp; Depend upon it he

<P>had encouragement."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this

<P>assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,

<P>are unjust to Harriet.&nbsp; Harriet's claims to marry well are not

<P>so contemptible as you represent them.&nbsp; She is not a clever girl,

<P>but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not

<P>deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.

<P>Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you

<P>describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in

<P>the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations

<P>to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,

<P>and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;

<P>and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject

<P>of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall

<P>in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,

<P>with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired

<P>and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,

<P>consequently a claim to be nice.&nbsp; Her good-nature, too, is not
so very

<P>slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness

<P>of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great

<P>readiness to be pleased with other people.&nbsp; I am very much mistaken

<P>if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,

<P>the highest claims a woman could possess."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,

<P>is almost enough to make me think so too.&nbsp; Better be without sense,

<P>than misapply it as you do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure!" cried she playfully.&nbsp; "I know that is the feeling

<P>of you all.&nbsp; I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly

<P>what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses

<P>and satisfies his judgment.&nbsp; Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.

<P>Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.

<P>And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning

<P>to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first

<P>offer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr. Knightley

<P>presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now

<P>perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.

<P>You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what

<P>she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her

<P>reach will be good enough for her.&nbsp; Vanity working on a weak head,

<P>produces every sort of mischief.&nbsp; Nothing so easy as for a young
lady

<P>to raise her expectations too high.&nbsp; Miss Harriet Smith may not
find

<P>offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.

<P>Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.

<P>Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves

<P>with a girl of such obscurity-- and most prudent men would be

<P>afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,

<P>when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.&nbsp; Let her
marry

<P>Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;

<P>but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach

<P>her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence

<P>and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's

<P>all the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a

<P>girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,

<P>and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,

<P>that there can be no use in canvassing it.&nbsp; We shall only be making

<P>each other more angry.&nbsp; But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin,

<P>it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,

<P>as must prevent any second application.&nbsp; She must abide by the
evil

<P>of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,

<P>I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;

<P>but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.

<P>His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,

<P>that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.

<P>I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,

<P>she might tolerate him.&nbsp; He was the brother of her friends,

<P>and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen

<P>nobody better (that must have been his great assistant)

<P>she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.

<P>But the case is altered now.&nbsp; She knows now what gentlemen are;

<P>and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance

<P>with Harriet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr. Knightley.--"Robert

<P>Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend

<P>them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could
understand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was

<P>really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.

<P>She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself

<P>a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he

<P>could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment

<P>in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;

<P>and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,

<P>was very disagreeable.&nbsp; Some minutes passed in this unpleasant
silence,

<P>with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather,

<P>but he made no answer.&nbsp; He was thinking.&nbsp; The result of his
thoughts

<P>appeared at last in these words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I

<P>hope it will not be long before he does.&nbsp; Your views for Harriet

<P>are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love

<P>of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,

<P>and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you

<P>that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma laughed and disclaimed.&nbsp; He continued,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Depend upon it, Elton will not do.&nbsp; Elton is a very good sort
of man,

<P>and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely

<P>to make an imprudent match.&nbsp; He knows the value of a good income

<P>as well as any body.&nbsp; Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will

<P>act rationally.&nbsp; He is as well acquainted with his own claims,
as you

<P>can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,

<P>and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way

<P>of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,

<P>I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.

<P>I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family

<P>of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all

<P>twenty thousand pounds apiece."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again.

<P>"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would

<P>have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want

<P>to keep Harriet to myself.&nbsp; I have done with match-making indeed.

<P>I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.&nbsp; I shall
leave

<P>off while I am well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good morning to you,"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.

<P>He was very much vexed.&nbsp; He felt the disappointment of the young
man,

<P>and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the

<P>sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had

<P>taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more

<P>indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.&nbsp; She did not
always

<P>feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that

<P>her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.

<P>He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.

<P>She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little

<P>time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.

<P>Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.

<P>The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's

<P>that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,

<P>gave alarming ideas.&nbsp; The dread of such a failure after all became
the

<P>prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,

<P>and without having any such reason to give for her long absence,

<P>she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,

<P>and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,

<P>she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings

<P>would not justify.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered

<P>that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,

<P>neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,

<P>in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such

<P>an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it

<P>hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather

<P>said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew

<P>any thing about.&nbsp; He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak

<P>with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not

<P>be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;

<P>he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;

<P>but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence

<P>of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley

<P>saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;

<P>but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any

<P>hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;

<P>and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very

<P>sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,

<P>not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.&nbsp; Miss Nash

<P>had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately

<P>with great delight.&nbsp; Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend

<P>a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,

<P>that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met

<P>Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was

<P>actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till

<P>the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been

<P>never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him

<P>about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,

<P>to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off

<P>his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been

<P>determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed,

<P>that he was going on business which he would not put off for any

<P>inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,

<P>and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.&nbsp; Mr. Perry

<P>could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must

<P>be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only

<P>looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.

<P>Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more

<P>about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,

<P>"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,

<P>but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,

<P>she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,

<P>Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness."
