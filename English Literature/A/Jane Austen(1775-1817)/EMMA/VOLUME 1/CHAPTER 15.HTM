<P>Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his

<P>tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three

<P>companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness

<P>of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.&nbsp; Mr. Weston was

<P>chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;

<P>but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.

<P>Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.

<P>Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.&nbsp; He joined

<P>them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself

<P>between them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind

<P>by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget

<P>his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before,

<P>and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen

<P>with most friendly smiles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--

<P>her fair, lovely, amiable friend.&nbsp; "Did she know?--had she

<P>heard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?--

<P>he felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her

<P>complaint alarmed him considerably."&nbsp; And in this style he talked

<P>on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,

<P>but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat;

<P>and Emma was quite in charity with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if

<P>he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,

<P>than on Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection,

<P>than that there should be no infection in the complaint.&nbsp; He began

<P>with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting

<P>the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to promise

<P>him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry

<P>and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off

<P>and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no

<P>putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.&nbsp; She was vexed.

<P>It did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence

<P>of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy,

<P>if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty

<P>in behaving with temper.&nbsp; He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore

<P>her assistance, "Would not she give him her support?--would not she

<P>add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go

<P>to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder

<P>had no infection?&nbsp; He could not be satisfied without a promise--

<P>would not she give him her influence in procuring it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So scrupulous for others," he continued, "and yet so careless

<P>for herself!&nbsp; She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home
to-day,

<P>and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated

<P>sore throat herself.&nbsp; Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between
us.

<P>Have not I some right to complain?&nbsp; I am sure of your kind support

<P>and aid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great,

<P>at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself

<P>the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was

<P>too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly

<P>saying any thing to the purpose.&nbsp; She could only give him a look;

<P>but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses,

<P>and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving

<P>her all her attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly

<P>did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came

<P>into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them

<P>all with the information of the ground being covered with snow,

<P>and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;

<P>concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,

<P>sir.&nbsp; Something new for your coachman and horses to be making

<P>their way through a storm of snow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else

<P>had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,

<P>and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston

<P>and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention

<P>from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I admired your resolution very much, sir," said he, "in venturing

<P>out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow

<P>very soon.&nbsp; Every body must have seen the snow coming on.

<P>I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.

<P>Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable;

<P>and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part

<P>of the common field there will be the other at hand.&nbsp; I dare say
we

<P>shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he

<P>had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,

<P>lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse

<P>for his hurrying away.&nbsp; As to there being any quantity of snow
fallen

<P>or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;

<P>he was afraid they would find no difficulty.&nbsp; He wished the road
might

<P>be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls;

<P>and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might

<P>be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him,

<P>that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,

<P>which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there

<P>being but two spare rooms in the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?"

<P>was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say

<P>for some time.&nbsp; To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances

<P>of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses,

<P>and of James, and of their having so many friends about them,

<P>revived him a little.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.&nbsp; The horror of

<P>being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,

<P>was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just

<P>passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,

<P>she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain

<P>at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through

<P>all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said she;

<P>"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;

<P>and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.

<P>I am not at all afraid.&nbsp; I should not mind walking half the way.

<P>I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is
not

<P>the sort of thing that gives me cold."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!" replied he.&nbsp; "Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most

<P>extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every

<P>thing does give you cold.&nbsp; Walk home!--you are prettily shod

<P>for walking home, I dare say.&nbsp; It will be bad enough for the horses."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.

<P>Mrs. Weston could only approve.&nbsp; Isabella then went to Emma;

<P>but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being

<P>all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point,

<P>when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his

<P>brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them

<P>that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there

<P>not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they

<P>liked it, either now or an hour hence.&nbsp; He had gone beyond the
sweep--

<P>some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half

<P>an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground;

<P>a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting,

<P>and there was every appearance of its being soon over.&nbsp; He had
seen

<P>the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing

<P>to apprehend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they

<P>were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account,

<P>who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous

<P>constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not

<P>be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued

<P>at Randalls.&nbsp; He was satisfied of there being no present danger
in

<P>returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe

<P>to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,

<P>Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:&nbsp; thus--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am ready, if the others are."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I ring the bell?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.&nbsp; A few

<P>minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion

<P>deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other

<P>recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The carriage came:&nbsp; and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object
on

<P>such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley

<P>and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some

<P>renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,

<P>and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.

<P>"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.&nbsp; He was afraid

<P>poor Isabella would not like it.&nbsp; And there would be poor Emma

<P>in the carriage behind.&nbsp; He did not know what they had best do.

<P>They must keep as much together as they could;" and James was talked
to,

<P>and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that
he

<P>did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;

<P>so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second

<P>carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,

<P>and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.&nbsp; It would not have
been

<P>the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,

<P>previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked

<P>to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have

<P>seemed but one.&nbsp; But now, she would rather it had not happened.

<P>She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine,

<P>and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was

<P>immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity

<P>of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had

<P>they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she

<P>found her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded,

<P>and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:&nbsp; availing himself

<P>of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already

<P>well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him;

<P>but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled

<P>love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect,

<P>and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon

<P>as possible.&nbsp; It really was so.&nbsp; Without scruple--without
apology--

<P>without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,

<P>was professing himself her lover.&nbsp; She tried to stop him; but vainly;

<P>he would go on, and say it all.&nbsp; Angry as she was, the thought
of

<P>the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.

<P>She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore

<P>could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.

<P>Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she

<P>hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.&nbsp; This to me! you forget
yourself--

<P>you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall

<P>be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!"--

<P>And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful

<P>pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account

<P>for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak

<P>either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.&nbsp; Command yourself

<P>enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,

<P>not at all to confuse his intellects.&nbsp; He perfectly knew his own
meaning;

<P>and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,

<P>and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--

<P>but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned

<P>at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very

<P>urgent for a favourable answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy

<P>and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.&nbsp; You have made

<P>yourself too clear.&nbsp; Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond

<P>any thing I can express.&nbsp; After such behaviour, as I have witnessed

<P>during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I

<P>have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me

<P>in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed,

<P>which I had not supposed possible!&nbsp; Believe me, sir, I am far,

<P>very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this?--

<P>Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course

<P>of my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:

<P>never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.

<P>If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her,

<P>and I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!

<P>Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse

<P>is near!&nbsp; No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.

<P>I have thought only of you.&nbsp; I protest against having paid the
smallest

<P>attention to any one else.&nbsp; Every thing that I have said or done,

<P>for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my

<P>adoration of yourself.&nbsp; You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.

<P>No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen

<P>and understood me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--

<P>which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.&nbsp; She was

<P>too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:

<P>and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's

<P>sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he

<P>joyously exclaimed--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.

<P>It confesses that you have long understood me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing.&nbsp; So far from

<P>having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error

<P>with respect to your views, till this moment.&nbsp; As to myself, I
am

<P>very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--

<P>Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my

<P>friend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me

<P>great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:

<P>but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,

<P>I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits

<P>so frequent.&nbsp; Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend

<P>yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought

<P>seriously of her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never, madam," cried he, affronted in his turn:&nbsp; "never, I assure
you.

<P>I think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort

<P>of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.

<P>I wish her extremely well:&nbsp; and, no doubt, there are men who might
not

<P>object to--Every body has their level:&nbsp; but as for myself, I am
not,

<P>I think, quite so much at a loss.&nbsp; I need not so totally despair

<P>of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--

<P>No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only;

<P>and the encouragement I received--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely

<P>mistaken in supposing it.&nbsp; I have seen you only as the admirer

<P>of my friend.&nbsp; In no other light could you have been more to me
than

<P>a common acquaintance.&nbsp; I am exceedingly sorry:&nbsp; but it is
well that

<P>the mistake ends where it does.&nbsp; Had the same behaviour continued,

<P>Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views;

<P>not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very

<P>great inequality which you are so sensible of.&nbsp; But, as it is,

<P>the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.

<P>I have no thoughts of matrimony at present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided

<P>to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,

<P>and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few

<P>minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them

<P>to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have

<P>been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left

<P>no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.&nbsp; Without knowing

<P>when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,

<P>they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;

<P>and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it

<P>indispensable to wish him a good night.&nbsp; The compliment was just
returned,

<P>coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,

<P>she was then conveyed to Hartfield.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,

<P>who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from

<P>Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--

<P>and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it

<P>seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:

<P>for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all

<P>kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort

<P>of her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin

<P>of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;

<P>and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little
party,

<P>except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;

<P>and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful
till

<P>the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.
