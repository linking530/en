<P>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.

<P>Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,

<P>and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,

<P>so did their satisfaction in each other.&nbsp; As a walking companion,

<P>Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.

<P>In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.&nbsp; Her father

<P>never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground

<P>sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;

<P>and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.

<P>She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;

<P>and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any

<P>time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.

<P>But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,

<P>and was confirmed in all her kind designs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,

<P>grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring

<P>to be guided by any one she looked up to.&nbsp; Her early attachment

<P>to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,

<P>and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that

<P>there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must

<P>not be expected.&nbsp; Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet

<P>Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the

<P>something which her home required.&nbsp; Such a friend as Mrs. Weston

<P>was out of the question.&nbsp; Two such could never be granted.

<P>Two such she did not want.&nbsp; It was quite a different sort of thing,

<P>a sentiment distinct and independent.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was the object

<P>of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.

<P>Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.

<P>For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who

<P>were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.&nbsp; She was ready to
tell

<P>every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.

<P>Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never

<P>believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered

<P>the truth.&nbsp; Harriet had no penetration.&nbsp; She had been satisfied

<P>to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;

<P>and looked no farther.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the

<P>school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and

<P>but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,

<P>it must have been the whole.&nbsp; But the Martins occupied her thoughts

<P>a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,

<P>and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe

<P>the many comforts and wonders of the place.&nbsp; Emma encouraged her

<P>talkativeness-- amused by such a picture of another set of beings,

<P>and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much

<P>exultation of Mrs. Martin's having "two parlours, two very good parlours,

<P>indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room;

<P>and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years

<P>with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,

<P>and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;

<P>and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be

<P>called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house

<P>in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink

<P>tea:-- a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate
cause;

<P>but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.

<P>She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,

<P>a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared

<P>that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always

<P>mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something

<P>or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,

<P>no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little

<P>friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she

<P>were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number

<P>and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,

<P>and there was evidently no dislike to it.&nbsp; Harriet was very ready

<P>to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry

<P>evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured

<P>and obliging.&nbsp; He had gone three miles round one day in order to
bring

<P>her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,

<P>and in every thing else he was so very obliging.&nbsp; He had his

<P>shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.

<P>She was very fond of singing.&nbsp; He could sing a little himself.

<P>She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.

<P>He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,

<P>he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.

<P>She believed every body spoke well of him.&nbsp; His mother and sisters

<P>were very fond of him.&nbsp; Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there

<P>was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body

<P>to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,

<P>he would make a good husband.&nbsp; Not that she wanted him to marry.

<P>She was in no hurry at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma.&nbsp; "You know what you are
about."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send

<P>Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had

<P>ever seen.&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked
all

<P>the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,

<P>to sup with her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line

<P>of his own business? He does not read?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has

<P>read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.

<P>He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay

<P>in one of the window seats--but he reads all them to himself.

<P>But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read

<P>something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.

<P>And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.&nbsp; He never read the

<P>Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.&nbsp; He had never

<P>heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined

<P>to get them now as soon as ever he can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next question was--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.&nbsp; I thought him very plain

<P>at first, but I do not think him so plain now.&nbsp; One does not, you
know,

<P>after a time.&nbsp; But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every

<P>now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way

<P>to Kingston.&nbsp; He has passed you very often."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without

<P>having any idea of his name.&nbsp; A young farmer, whether on horseback

<P>or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.

<P>The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I

<P>can have nothing to do.&nbsp; A degree or two lower, and a creditable

<P>appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their

<P>families in some way or other.&nbsp; But a farmer can need none of my
help,

<P>and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every

<P>other he is below it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure.&nbsp; Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have

<P>observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.

<P>I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.

<P>What do you imagine his age to be?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is

<P>the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.&nbsp; His mother
is

<P>perfectly right not to be in a hurry.&nbsp; They seem very comfortable

<P>as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,

<P>she would probably repent it.&nbsp; Six years hence, if he could meet

<P>with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,

<P>with a little money, it might be very desirable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,

<P>who are not born to an independence.&nbsp; Mr. Martin, I imagine,

<P>has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with

<P>the world.&nbsp; Whatever money he might come into when his father died,

<P>whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,

<P>all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,

<P>with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to

<P>impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure, so it is.&nbsp; But they live very comfortably.

<P>They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;

<P>and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does

<P>marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though

<P>his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether

<P>objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all
fit

<P>for you to notice.&nbsp; The misfortune of your birth ought to make
you

<P>particularly careful as to your associates.&nbsp; There can be no doubt

<P>of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your

<P>claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there

<P>will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.&nbsp; But while I visit

<P>at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>I am not afraid of what any body can do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I

<P>would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be

<P>independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; I want to see
you

<P>permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable

<P>to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say

<P>that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,

<P>I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,

<P>to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere

<P>farmer's daughter, without education."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever
marry any body

<P>but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.

<P>However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I

<P>am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.&nbsp; I shall

<P>always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,

<P>and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well

<P>educated as me.&nbsp; But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,

<P>certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,

<P>and saw no alarming symptoms of love.&nbsp; The young man had been

<P>the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,

<P>and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side,

<P>to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the

<P>Donwell road.&nbsp; He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully

<P>at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.

<P>Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;

<P>and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made

<P>her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.

<P>His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,

<P>but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be

<P>contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground

<P>he had gained in Harriet's inclination.&nbsp; Harriet was not insensible

<P>of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness

<P>with admiration as well as wonder.&nbsp; Mr. Martin looked as if he

<P>did not know what manner was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must

<P>not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a

<P>smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse

<P>hoped very soon to compose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was

<P>quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.

<P>He did not think we ever walked this road.&nbsp; He thought we walked

<P>towards Randalls most days.&nbsp; He has not been able to get the

<P>Romance of the Forest yet.&nbsp; He was so busy the last time he was

<P>at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.

<P>So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he

<P>like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him

<P>so very plain?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is

<P>nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.&nbsp; I had no

<P>right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no

<P>idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.

<P>I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not

<P>so genteel as real gentlemen."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been

<P>repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,

<P>that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.

<P>At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,

<P>well bred men.&nbsp; I should be surprized if, after seeing them,

<P>you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving

<P>him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at

<P>yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.

<P>Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure

<P>you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,

<P>and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated

<P>as I stood here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; He has not such a fine

<P>air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; I see the difference

<P>plain enough.&nbsp; But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair

<P>to compare Mr. Martin with him.&nbsp; You might not see one in a hundred

<P>with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; But he
is

<P>not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.&nbsp; What say
you

<P>to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them.

<P>Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;

<P>of being silent.&nbsp; You must see the difference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.&nbsp; But Mr. Weston is almost

<P>an old man.&nbsp; Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.&nbsp; The older a

<P>person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners

<P>should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,

<P>or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.&nbsp; What is passable in youth

<P>is detestable in later age.&nbsp; Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;

<P>what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather solemnly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But there may be pretty good guessing.&nbsp; He will be a completely
gross,

<P>vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking

<P>of nothing but profit and loss."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the

<P>circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.

<P>He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing

<P>else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.&nbsp; What
has

<P>he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he will thrive,

<P>and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse

<P>need not disturb us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wonder he did not remember the book"--was all Harriet's answer,

<P>and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might

<P>be safely left to itself.&nbsp; She, therefore, said no more for some
time.

<P>Her next beginning was,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior

<P>to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness.

<P>They might be more safely held up as a pattern.&nbsp; There is an openness,

<P>a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body

<P>likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it--but

<P>that would not do to be copied.&nbsp; Neither would Mr. Knightley's

<P>downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits

<P>him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem

<P>to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,

<P>he would not be sufferable.&nbsp; On the contrary, I think a young man

<P>might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.

<P>Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.

<P>He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.&nbsp; I do not

<P>know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either

<P>of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his

<P>manners are softer than they used to be.&nbsp; If he means any thing,

<P>it must be to please you.&nbsp; Did not I tell you what he said of you

<P>the other day?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn

<P>from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed

<P>and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving

<P>the young farmer out of Harriet's head.&nbsp; She thought it would

<P>be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,

<P>and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.

<P>She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.

<P>It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled

<P>her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during

<P>the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.&nbsp; The longer

<P>she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.

<P>Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,

<P>and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family

<P>that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.&nbsp; He
had a

<P>comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;

<P>for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known

<P>to have some independent property; and she thought very highly

<P>of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,

<P>without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful

<P>girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,

<P>was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be

<P>little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all

<P>the usual weight and efficacy.&nbsp; And he was really a very pleasing

<P>young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.

<P>He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,

<P>though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which

<P>she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified

<P>by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts

<P>for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.
