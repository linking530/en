<P>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.&nbsp; He liked very
much

<P>to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,

<P>from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,

<P>from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the

<P>visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.

<P>He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;

<P>his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit

<P>for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.

<P>Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,

<P>and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,

<P>comprehended many such.&nbsp; Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,

<P>he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening

<P>parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any

<P>time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week

<P>in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;

<P>and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,

<P>the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude

<P>for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,

<P>and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being

<P>thrown away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able

<P>of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies

<P>almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,

<P>and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse

<P>thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.&nbsp; Had it

<P>taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a

<P>very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.

<P>She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was

<P>considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,

<P>under such untoward circumstances, can excite.&nbsp; Her daughter enjoyed

<P>a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,

<P>handsome, rich, nor married.&nbsp; Miss Bates stood in the very worst

<P>predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;

<P>and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,

<P>or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.

<P>She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.&nbsp; Her youth

<P>had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted

<P>to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small

<P>income go as far as possible.&nbsp; And yet she was a happy woman,

<P>and a woman whom no one named without good-will.&nbsp; It was her own

<P>universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.

<P>She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,

<P>quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate

<P>creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,

<P>and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted

<P>for nothing.&nbsp; The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,

<P>her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,

<P>and a mine of felicity to herself.&nbsp; She was a great talker upon

<P>little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial

<P>communications and harmless gossip.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,

<P>or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences
of

<P>refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,

<P>upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for

<P>enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but

<P>a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable

<P>quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,

<P>and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble

<P>themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming

<P>back prodigies.&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and

<P>very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy

<P>spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty

<P>of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,

<P>and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.

<P>It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked

<P>after her to church.&nbsp; She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,

<P>who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled

<P>to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly

<P>owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim

<P>on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,

<P>whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently

<P>able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,

<P>in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,

<P>it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She was delighted

<P>to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with

<P>herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings

<P>of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent

<P>was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close

<P>of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,

<P>in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;

<P>a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,

<P>whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,

<P>on account of her beauty.&nbsp; A very gracious invitation was returned,

<P>and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.&nbsp; Somebody had

<P>placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,

<P>and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar

<P>to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known

<P>of her history.&nbsp; She had no visible friends but what had been

<P>acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit

<P>in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with
her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort

<P>which Emma particularly admired.&nbsp; She was short, plump, and fair,

<P>with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,

<P>and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,

<P>Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite

<P>determined to continue the acquaintance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's

<P>conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not

<P>inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,

<P>shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly

<P>grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly

<P>impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style

<P>to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,

<P>and deserve encouragement.&nbsp; Encouragement should be given.

<P>Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be

<P>wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.

<P>The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.

<P>The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort

<P>of people, must be doing her harm.&nbsp; They were a family of the name

<P>of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm

<P>of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,

<P>she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they

<P>must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates

<P>of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance

<P>to be quite perfect.&nbsp; She would notice her; she would improve her;

<P>she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her

<P>into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.

<P>It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;

<P>highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking

<P>and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that

<P>the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,

<P>which always closed such parties, and for which she had been

<P>used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,

<P>and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.&nbsp; With an

<P>alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never

<P>indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,

<P>with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,

<P>did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend

<P>the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she

<P>knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their
guests.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.

<P>He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion

<P>of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome

<P>made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his

<P>hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,

<P>his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that

<P>he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he

<P>might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing

<P>the nicer things, to say:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.

<P>An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.&nbsp; Serle understands
boiling

<P>an egg better than any body.&nbsp; I would not recommend an egg boiled

<P>by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,

<P>you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.&nbsp; Miss Bates,

<P>let Emma help you to a little bit of tart--a very little bit.

<P>Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome

<P>preserves here.&nbsp; I do not advise the custard.&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard,
what say

<P>you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler

<P>of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in

<P>a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had

<P>particular pleasure in sending them away happy.&nbsp; The happiness

<P>of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse

<P>was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the

<P>introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,

<P>grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,

<P>delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated

<P>her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!
