<P>"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley,
"of

<P>this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a
bad thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?-- why so?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her

<P>with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.

<P>I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.

<P>How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any

<P>good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels

<P>about Emma, Mr. Knightley."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,

<P>knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,

<P>for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.&nbsp; We were speaking

<P>of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,

<P>that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.

<P>Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.

<P>You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value

<P>of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort

<P>a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used

<P>to it all her life.&nbsp; I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.

<P>She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be.

<P>But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,

<P>it will be an inducement to her to read more herself.&nbsp; They will

<P>read together.&nbsp; She means it, I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve

<P>years old.&nbsp; I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at

<P>various times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and

<P>very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly

<P>arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.

<P>The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it

<P>did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;

<P>and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.&nbsp; But
I

<P>have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.

<P>She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,

<P>and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.&nbsp; Where Miss
Taylor

<P>failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do

<P>nothing.-- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you

<P>wished.--You know you could not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought

<P>so then;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's

<P>omitting to do any thing I wished."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,"--said

<P>Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.&nbsp;
"But I,"

<P>he soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,

<P>must still see, hear, and remember.&nbsp; Emma is spoiled by being the

<P>cleverest of her family.&nbsp; At ten years old, she had the misfortune
of

<P>being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.

<P>She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.

<P>And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house

<P>and of you all.&nbsp; In her mother she lost the only person able to
cope

<P>with her.&nbsp; She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been

<P>under subjection to her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on

<P>your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted

<P>another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word
for

<P>me to any body.&nbsp; I am sure you always thought me unfit for the
office I held."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said he, smiling.&nbsp; "You are better placed here; very fit

<P>for a wife, but not at all for a governess.&nbsp; But you were preparing

<P>yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.

<P>You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would

<P>seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her,

<P>on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,

<P>and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend

<P>him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; There will be very little merit in making a good wife

<P>to such a man as Mr. Weston."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,

<P>and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing

<P>to be borne.&nbsp; We will not despair, however.&nbsp; Weston may grow
cross

<P>from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope not that.--It is not likely.&nbsp; No, Mr. Knightley, do not

<P>foretell vexation from that quarter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not I, indeed.&nbsp; I only name possibilities.&nbsp; I do not pretend
to Emma's

<P>genius for foretelling and guessing.&nbsp; I hope, with all my heart,

<P>the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But

<P>Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.&nbsp; I think

<P>her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.

<P>She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.

<P>She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,

<P>because undesigned.&nbsp; Her ignorance is hourly flattery.&nbsp; How
can

<P>Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet

<P>is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,

<P>I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance.

<P>Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places

<P>she belongs to.&nbsp; She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable

<P>with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.

<P>I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind,

<P>or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties

<P>of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more

<P>anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.

<P>How well she looked last night!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?

<P>Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pretty! say beautiful rather.&nbsp; Can you imagine any thing nearer

<P>perfect beauty than Emma altogether-- face and figure?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have

<P>seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.

<P>But I am a partial old friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,

<P>open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,

<P>and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!

<P>There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,

<P>her glance.&nbsp; One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture

<P>of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete

<P>picture of grown-up health.&nbsp; She is loveliness itself.&nbsp; Mr.
Knightley,

<P>is not she?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not a fault to find with her person," he replied.

<P>"I think her all you describe.&nbsp; I love to look at her; and I

<P>will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.

<P>Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little

<P>occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston, I
am

<P>not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread

<P>of its doing them both harm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its

<P>not doing them any harm.&nbsp; With all dear Emma's little faults,

<P>she is an excellent creature.&nbsp; Where shall we see a better daughter,

<P>or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities

<P>which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;

<P>she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the

<P>right a hundred times."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well; I will not plague you any more.&nbsp; Emma shall be an angel,

<P>and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John

<P>and Isabella.&nbsp; John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore

<P>not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;

<P>except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.

<P>I am sure of having their opinions with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;

<P>but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,

<P>you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's

<P>mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think

<P>any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made

<P>a matter of much discussion among you.&nbsp; Pray excuse me; but supposing

<P>any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,

<P>it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,

<P>who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,

<P>so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.&nbsp; It has been
so

<P>many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,

<P>Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it.

<P>It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your

<P>advice has often found; for it shall be attended to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy

<P>about her sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry.&nbsp; I will
keep

<P>my ill-humour to myself.&nbsp; I have a very sincere interest in Emma.

<P>Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a

<P>greater interest; perhaps hardly so great.&nbsp; There is an anxiety,

<P>a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.&nbsp; I wonder what will become

<P>of her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,

<P>means just nothing at all.&nbsp; But I have no idea that she has yet

<P>ever seen a man she cared for.&nbsp; It would not be a bad thing for
her

<P>to be very much in love with a proper object.&nbsp; I should like to
see

<P>Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.

<P>But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom

<P>from home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break

<P>her resolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be;

<P>and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be

<P>forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties

<P>on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.&nbsp; I do not recommend matrimony

<P>at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of

<P>her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible.

<P>There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it

<P>was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition

<P>which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "What does Weston

<P>think of the weather; shall we have rain?" convinced her that he

<P>had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
