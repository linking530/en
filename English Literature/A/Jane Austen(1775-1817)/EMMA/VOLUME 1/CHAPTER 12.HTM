<P>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination

<P>of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him

<P>in Isabella's first day.&nbsp; Emma's sense of right however had decided
it;

<P>and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,

<P>she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late

<P>disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him

<P>the proper invitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She hoped they might now become friends again.&nbsp; She thought it

<P>was time to make up.&nbsp; Making-up indeed would not do.&nbsp; She
certainly

<P>had not been in the wrong, and he would never own that he had.

<P>Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear

<P>to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather

<P>assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room

<P>she had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl

<P>about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,

<P>and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms.&nbsp; It did assist;

<P>for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon

<P>led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child

<P>out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.

<P>Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving

<P>her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,

<P>she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.

<P>As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;

<P>but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men

<P>and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your

<P>dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,

<P>we might always think alike."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being

<P>in the wrong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said he, smiling--"and reason good.&nbsp; I was sixteen years

<P>old when you were born."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A material difference then," she replied--"and no doubt you were

<P>much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does

<P>not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings

<P>a good deal nearer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--a good deal nearer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,

<P>if we think differently."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and
by

<P>not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.&nbsp; Come, my dear
Emma,

<P>let us be friends, and say no more about it.&nbsp; Tell your aunt, little
Emma,

<P>that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing

<P>old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's true," she cried--"very true.&nbsp; Little Emma, grow up

<P>a better woman than your aunt.&nbsp; Be infinitely cleverer and not

<P>half so conceited.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and
I

<P>have done.&nbsp; As far as good intentions went, we were both right,

<P>and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet

<P>proved wrong.&nbsp; I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,

<P>very bitterly disappointed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A man cannot be more so," was his short, full answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John

<P>Knightley made his appearance, and "How d'ye do, George?" and "John,

<P>how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying under

<P>a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment

<P>which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing

<P>for the good of the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined

<P>cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his

<P>dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;

<P>on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;

<P>their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma

<P>only occasionally joining in one or the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally

<P>of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,

<P>and who was always the greater talker.&nbsp; As a magistrate, he had

<P>generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,

<P>some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand

<P>the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear

<P>next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail

<P>of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been

<P>the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.

<P>The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,

<P>and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,

<P>was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his

<P>cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever

<P>left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached

<P>a tone of eagerness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying

<P>a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My poor dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand,

<P>and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one

<P>of her five children--"How long it is, how terribly long since you

<P>were here!&nbsp; And how tired you must be after your journey!&nbsp;
You must

<P>go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you

<P>before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.

<P>My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,

<P>that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article

<P>as herself;--and two basins only were ordered.&nbsp; After a little

<P>more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its

<P>not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,

<P>with an air of grave reflection,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn

<P>at South End instead of coming here.&nbsp; I never had much opinion

<P>of the sea air."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we

<P>should not have gone.&nbsp; He recommended it for all the children,

<P>but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--

<P>both sea air and bathing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her

<P>any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,

<P>though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very

<P>rarely of use to any body.&nbsp; I am sure it almost killed me once."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, "I must

<P>beg you not to talk of the sea.&nbsp; It makes me envious and miserable;--

<P>I who have never seen it!&nbsp; South End is prohibited, if you please.

<P>My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about

<P>Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, pretty well; but not quite well.&nbsp; Poor Perry is bilious,

<P>and he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has

<P>not time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is

<P>always wanted all round the country.&nbsp; I suppose there is not a
man

<P>in such practice anywhere.&nbsp; But then there is not so clever a man

<P>any where."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?

<P>I have a great regard for Mr. Perry.&nbsp; I hope he will be calling
soon.

<P>He will be so pleased to see my little ones."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask

<P>him about myself of some consequence.&nbsp; And, my dear, whenever he
comes,

<P>you had better let him look at little Bella's throat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly

<P>any uneasiness about it.&nbsp; Either bathing has been of the greatest

<P>service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent

<P>embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying

<P>at times ever since August."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been

<P>of use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,

<P>I would have spoken to--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said Emma,

<P>"I have not heard one inquiry after them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you

<P>mention them in most of your letters.&nbsp; I hope they are quite well.

<P>Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take

<P>my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--

<P>And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--

<P>How are they, sir?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.&nbsp; But poor Mrs. Bates

<P>had a bad cold about a month ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How sorry I am!&nbsp; But colds were never so prevalent as they have
been

<P>this autumn.&nbsp; Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them

<P>more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree

<P>you mention.&nbsp; Perry says that colds have been very general,

<P>but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.

<P>Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly except--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always

<P>a sickly season.&nbsp; Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.

<P>It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--

<P>and the air so bad!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed--we are not at all in a bad air.&nbsp; Our part of London
is

<P>very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London

<P>in general, my dear sir.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square

<P>is very different from almost all the rest.&nbsp; We are so very airy!

<P>I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--

<P>there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my

<P>children in:&nbsp; but we are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks

<P>the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as

<P>to air."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.&nbsp; You make the best of it--

<P>but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you

<P>different creatures; you do not look like the same.&nbsp; Now I cannot
say,

<P>that I think you are any of you looking well at present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those

<P>little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely

<P>free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were

<P>rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were

<P>a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness

<P>of coming.&nbsp; I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;

<P>for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe

<P>he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.&nbsp; I trust,

<P>at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,"

<P>turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.&nbsp; I think Mr. John

<P>Knightley very far from looking well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?" cried Mr. John

<P>Knightley, hearing his own name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you

<P>looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.

<P>I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen

<P>Mr. Wingfield before you left home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Isabella,"--exclaimed he hastily--"pray do not concern

<P>yourself about my looks.&nbsp; Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling

<P>yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,"

<P>cried Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff

<P>from Scotland, to look after his new estate.&nbsp; What will it answer?

<P>Will not the old prejudice be too strong?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced

<P>to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing

<P>worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;

<P>and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general,

<P>she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.--

<P>"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment

<P>accidentally in town!&nbsp; What happiness it must be to her good old

<P>grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!

<P>I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot

<P>be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose

<P>Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.

<P>She would be such a delightful companion for Emma."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another

<P>pretty kind of young person.&nbsp; You will like Harriet.&nbsp; Emma
could

<P>not have a better companion than Harriet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be

<P>so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of

<P>similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening

<P>did not close without a little return of agitation.&nbsp; The gruel
came

<P>and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--

<P>undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,

<P>and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was

<P>never met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures

<P>which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore

<P>most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman

<P>hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she

<P>meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.

<P>Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able

<P>to get any thing tolerable.&nbsp; Here was a dangerous opening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on

<P>her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed,

<P>"Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to

<P>South End.&nbsp; It does not bear talking of."&nbsp; And for a little
while

<P>she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination

<P>might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel.

<P>After an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,

<P>instead of coming here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children

<P>a great deal of good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not

<P>have been to South End.&nbsp; South End is an unhealthy place.

<P>Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is

<P>quite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,

<P>never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield

<P>says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;

<P>and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands

<P>the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been

<P>there repeatedly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--

<P>Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best

<P>of all the sea-bathing places.&nbsp; A fine open sea, he says, and very

<P>pure air.&nbsp; And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings
there

<P>quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.

<P>You should have consulted Perry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how

<P>great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else

<P>should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much

<P>to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,

<P>better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get

<P>into a worse air.&nbsp; This is just what Perry said.&nbsp; It seemed
to him

<P>a very ill-judged measure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he

<P>had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her

<P>brother-in-law's breaking out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Perry," said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,

<P>"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for.

<P>Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--

<P>at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may

<P>be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--

<P>I want his directions no more than his drugs."&nbsp; He paused--

<P>and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness,

<P>"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children

<P>a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense

<P>or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to

<P>prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True, true," cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--

<P>"very true.&nbsp; That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what
I

<P>was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning

<P>it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows,

<P>I cannot conceive any difficulty.&nbsp; I should not attempt it,

<P>if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,

<P>but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . .

<P>The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps.

<P>I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we

<P>will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on

<P>his friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously,

<P>been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--

<P>but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed

<P>the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother,

<P>and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.
