<P>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy

<P>a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity

<P>to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible

<P>than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most

<P>agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up

<P>the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon

<P>pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side,

<P>as there could be any occasion for.&nbsp; She was quite convinced

<P>of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love,

<P>if not in love already.&nbsp; She had no scruple with regard to him.

<P>He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could

<P>not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.

<P>His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner,

<P>since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least

<P>agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have given Miss Smith all that she required," said he;

<P>"you have made her graceful and easy.&nbsp; She was a beautiful creature

<P>when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have

<P>added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet

<P>only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.

<P>She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness

<P>in herself.&nbsp; I have done very little."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If it were admissible to contradict a lady," said the gallant

<P>Mr. Elton--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,

<P>have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her

<P>way before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.&nbsp; So much superadded

<P>decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.&nbsp; I never met with

<P>a disposition more truly amiable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort

<P>of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.

<P>She was not less pleased another day with the manner

<P>in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?" said she: "did

<P>you ever sit for your picture?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,

<P>with a very interesting naivete,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! dear, no, never."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would

<P>give any money for it.&nbsp; I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.

<P>You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had

<P>a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of

<P>my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.

<P>But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.

<P>But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.

<P>It would be such a delight to have her picture!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be a delight!

<P>Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a

<P>talent in favour of your friend.&nbsp; I know what your drawings are.

<P>How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in

<P>specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston

<P>some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking

<P>likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.&nbsp; Don't pretend to be

<P>in raptures about mine.&nbsp; Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.

<P>"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe

<P>I shall try what I can do.&nbsp; Harriet's features are very delicate,

<P>which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity

<P>in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought

<P>to catch."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I

<P>have not a doubt of your success.&nbsp; Pray, pray attempt it.

<P>As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,

<P>be an exquisite possession."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.

<P>She thinks so little of her own beauty.&nbsp; Did not you observe her

<P>manner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my

<P>picture be drawn?'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.&nbsp; It was not lost on me.

<P>But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;

<P>and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest

<P>pressing of both the others.&nbsp; Emma wished to go to work directly,

<P>and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts

<P>at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they

<P>might decide together on the best size for Harriet.&nbsp; Her many

<P>beginnings were displayed.&nbsp; Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,

<P>pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.

<P>She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress

<P>both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little

<P>labour as she would ever submit to.&nbsp; She played and sang;--and
drew

<P>in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;

<P>and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she

<P>would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.

<P>She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist

<P>or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,

<P>or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher

<P>than it deserved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the
most;

<P>her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there

<P>been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions

<P>would have been the same.&nbsp; They were both in ecstasies.&nbsp; A
likeness

<P>pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No great variety of faces for you," said Emma.&nbsp; "I had only my

<P>own family to study from.&nbsp; There is my father--another of my

<P>father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,

<P>that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very

<P>like therefore.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.

<P>Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.

<P>She would sit whenever I asked her.&nbsp; There is my sister; and really

<P>quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.

<P>I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have

<P>sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four

<P>children that she would not be quiet.&nbsp; Then, here come all my

<P>attempts at three of those four children;--there they are,

<P>Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,

<P>and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.&nbsp; She was
so

<P>eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no

<P>making children of three or four years old stand still you know;

<P>nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the

<P>air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any

<P>of mama's children ever were.&nbsp; Here is my sketch of the fourth,

<P>who was a baby.&nbsp; I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and
it

<P>is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.

<P>He had nestled down his head most conveniently.&nbsp; That's very like.

<P>I am rather proud of little George.&nbsp; The corner of the sofa is
very good.

<P>Then here is my last,"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman

<P>in small size, whole-length-- "my last and my best--my brother,

<P>Mr. John Knightley.&nbsp; --This did not want much of being finished,
when I

<P>put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.

<P>I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I

<P>had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I

<P>were quite agreed in thinking it very like)--only too handsome--too

<P>flattering--but that was a fault on the right side-- after

<P>all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--"Yes,

<P>it was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice."

<P>We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.

<P>It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I

<P>could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised

<P>over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in

<P>Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing

<P>any body again.&nbsp; But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own,

<P>and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present,

<P>I will break my resolution now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,

<P>and was repeating, "No husbands and wives in the case at present

<P>indeed, as you observe.&nbsp; Exactly so.&nbsp; No husbands and wives,"

<P>with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider

<P>whether she had not better leave them together at once.&nbsp; But as
she

<P>wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.

<P>It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John

<P>Knightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself,

<P>to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid

<P>of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet

<P>mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.

<P>But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind

<P>her and watching every touch.&nbsp; She gave him credit for stationing

<P>himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;

<P>but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to

<P>place himself elsewhere.&nbsp; It then occurred to her to employ him

<P>in reading.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness

<P>indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen

<P>the irksomeness of Miss Smith's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton was only too happy.&nbsp; Harriet listened, and Emma drew

<P>in peace.&nbsp; She must allow him to be still frequently coming to
look;

<P>any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;

<P>and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,

<P>to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no

<P>being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration

<P>made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.

<P>She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance

<P>were unexceptionable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite

<P>enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.

<P>There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,

<P>and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,

<P>to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had

<P>great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,

<P>and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a

<P>standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,

<P>and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations

<P>as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,

<P>entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By all means.&nbsp; We shall be most happy to consider you as one

<P>of the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,

<P>took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress

<P>of the picture, which was rapid and happy.&nbsp; Every body who saw
it

<P>was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended

<P>it through every criticism.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she

<P>wanted,"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting

<P>that she was addressing a lover.--"The expression of the eye is

<P>most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.

<P>It is the fault of her face that she has them not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think so?" replied he.&nbsp; "I cannot agree with you.

<P>It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.

<P>I never saw such a likeness in my life.&nbsp; We must allow for the
effect

<P>of shade, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have made her too tall, Emma," said Mr. Knightley.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.&nbsp; Consider,

<P>she is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which

<P>in short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must

<P>be preserved, you know.&nbsp; Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no!
it

<P>gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly
so indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is very pretty," said Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; "So prettily done! Just

<P>as your drawings always are, my dear.&nbsp; I do not know any body who
draws

<P>so well as you do.&nbsp; The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,

<P>that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl

<P>over her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.

<P>Look at the tree."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You, sir, may say any thing," cried Mr. Elton, "but I must confess

<P>that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss

<P>Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable

<P>spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character.

<P>The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is

<P>most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.&nbsp; I never saw such

<P>a likeness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a

<P>few difficulties.&nbsp; It must be done directly; it must be done in
London;

<P>the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose
taste

<P>could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,

<P>must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse

<P>could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs

<P>of December.&nbsp; But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,

<P>than it was removed.&nbsp; His gallantry was always on the alert.

<P>"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure

<P>should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.

<P>It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being

<P>employed on such an errand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!-- she would

<P>not give him such a troublesome office for the world,"--brought

<P>on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and

<P>a very few minutes settled the business.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,

<P>and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it

<P>as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he

<P>seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he

<P>received it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought Emma.

<P>"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different

<P>ways of being in love.&nbsp; He is an excellent young man, and will
suit

<P>Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself;

<P>but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more

<P>than I could endure as a principal.&nbsp; I come in for a pretty good

<P>share as a second.&nbsp; But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."
