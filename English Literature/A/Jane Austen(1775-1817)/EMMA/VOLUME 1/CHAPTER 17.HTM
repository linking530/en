<P>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.

<P>The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;

<P>and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter

<P>to stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole

<P>party set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny

<P>of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with

<P>those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults,

<P>and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right

<P>feminine happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note

<P>from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,

<P>to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that he was proposing

<P>to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;

<P>where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,

<P>he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted

<P>the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of

<P>weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense--

<P>and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just

<P>at this time was the very thing to be desired.&nbsp; She admired

<P>him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit

<P>for the manner in which it was announced.&nbsp; Resentment could not

<P>have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father,

<P>from which she was so pointedly excluded.&nbsp; She had not even a

<P>share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;--

<P>and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an

<P>ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,

<P>as she thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize

<P>of so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get

<P>safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.

<P>It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter

<P>for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.

<P>Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits

<P>to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.&nbsp; She had

<P>reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was

<P>desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting

<P>the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.

<P>She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo

<P>the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--

<P>She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously

<P>feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--

<P>and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her

<P>ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions,

<P>all her prophecies for the last six weeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight

<P>of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity

<P>with herself again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--

<P>and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition

<P>and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular

<P>advantage at that moment to her friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;

<P>and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,

<P>seemed on Harriet's side, not her own.&nbsp; Harriet did not consider

<P>herself as having any thing to complain of.&nbsp; The affection of such

<P>a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--

<P>She never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial

<P>and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless,

<P>that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--

<P>and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart

<P>and understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was

<P>the superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would

<P>be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or

<P>intelligence could do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded

<P>and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution

<P>confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination

<P>all the rest of her life.&nbsp; Her second duty now, inferior only to
her

<P>father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour

<P>to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.

<P>She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness,

<P>striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation,

<P>to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and
she

<P>could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,

<P>and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton

<P>in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,

<P>and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be

<P>made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return,

<P>as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,

<P>without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence

<P>of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,

<P>prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;

<P>but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive

<P>against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she could not

<P>comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident

<P>and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,

<P>she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness

<P>in the sight or the recollection of him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad

<P>for each, for all three.&nbsp; Not one of them had the power of removal,

<P>or of effecting any material change of society.&nbsp; They must encounter

<P>each other, and make the best of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at

<P>Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers

<P>and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only

<P>that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling

<P>moderation or repellent truth.&nbsp; Where the wound had been given,

<P>there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that,

<P>till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace

<P>for herself.
