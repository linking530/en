<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,

<P>which for the last two or three generations had been rising into

<P>gentility and property.&nbsp; He had received a good education, but,

<P>on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become

<P>indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers

<P>were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social

<P>temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances

<P>of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,

<P>of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love

<P>with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,

<P>who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,

<P>which the connexion would offend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command

<P>of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the

<P>family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it

<P>took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,

<P>who threw her off with due decorum.&nbsp; It was an unsuitable connexion,

<P>and did not produce much happiness.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston ought to have
found

<P>more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper

<P>made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness

<P>of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,

<P>she had not the best.&nbsp; She had resolution enough to pursue

<P>her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain

<P>from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,

<P>nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.&nbsp; They lived beyond

<P>their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:

<P>she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once

<P>to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,

<P>as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst

<P>of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,

<P>he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.

<P>From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.

<P>The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering

<P>illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;

<P>and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,

<P>nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to

<P>take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.

<P>Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed

<P>to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,

<P>the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,

<P>and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to

<P>improve as he could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A complete change of life became desirable.&nbsp; He quitted the militia

<P>and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a

<P>good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.

<P>It was a concern which brought just employment enough.&nbsp; He had
still

<P>a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;

<P>and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,

<P>the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.

<P>He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure

<P>the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had

<P>always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even

<P>as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own

<P>friendly and social disposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence

<P>his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth

<P>on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling

<P>till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long

<P>looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects

<P>in view, till they were accomplished.&nbsp; He had made his fortune,

<P>bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new

<P>period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness

<P>than in any yet passed through.&nbsp; He had never been an unhappy man;

<P>his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;

<P>but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly

<P>amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof

<P>of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,

<P>to excite gratitude than to feel it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was

<P>his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought

<P>up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption

<P>as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.

<P>It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his

<P>father's assistance.&nbsp; His father had no apprehension of it.

<P>The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;

<P>but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice

<P>could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,

<P>so deservedly dear.&nbsp; He saw his son every year in London,

<P>and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine

<P>young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.

<P>He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his

<P>merits and prospects a kind of common concern.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively

<P>curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little

<P>returned that he had never been there in his life.&nbsp; His coming

<P>to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,

<P>as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.

<P>There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when

<P>Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and

<P>Miss Bates returned the visit.&nbsp; Now was the time for Mr. Frank

<P>Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was

<P>understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.

<P>For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention

<P>of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.&nbsp; "I suppose you

<P>have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written

<P>to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.

<P>Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and
he

<P>says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had, of course,

<P>formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing

<P>attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,

<P>and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression

<P>of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.&nbsp; She
felt

<P>herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough

<P>to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only

<P>regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship

<P>for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,

<P>without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering

<P>an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear

<P>Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation

<P>than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,

<P>and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily

<P>through its little difficulties and privations.&nbsp; And then there
was

<P>such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,

<P>so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's

<P>disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching

<P>season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the

<P>week together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude

<P>to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her

<P>satisfaction---her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,

<P>was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,

<P>was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity

<P>`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre

<P>of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening

<P>attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.

<P>But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,

<P>and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of

<P>ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation

<P>to Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; The compliments of his neighbours were over;

<P>he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;

<P>and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,

<P>was all eat up.&nbsp; His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he

<P>could never believe other people to be different from himself.

<P>What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;

<P>and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having

<P>any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly

<P>tried to prevent any body's eating it.&nbsp; He had been at the pains

<P>of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.&nbsp; Mr. Perry

<P>was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one

<P>of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,

<P>he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the

<P>bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree

<P>with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.

<P>With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped

<P>to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the

<P>cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till

<P>it was all gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys

<P>being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their

<P>hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.
