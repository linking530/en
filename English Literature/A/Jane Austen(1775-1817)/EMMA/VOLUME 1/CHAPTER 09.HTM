<P>Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel

<P>with herself.&nbsp; He was so much displeased, that it was longer than

<P>usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,

<P>his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.&nbsp; She was sorry,

<P>but could not repent.&nbsp; On the contrary, her plans and proceedings

<P>were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general

<P>appearances of the next few days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after

<P>Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common

<P>sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences

<P>of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they
were

<P>visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment

<P>as her youth and sort of mind admitted.&nbsp; Emma was soon perfectly

<P>satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as

<P>he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the
latter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal

<P>of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than

<P>a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.

<P>It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let

<P>her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be

<P>labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;

<P>and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,

<P>the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,

<P>was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort

<P>that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,

<P>made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale

<P>are not uncommon.&nbsp; Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,

<P>had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken

<P>the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,

<P>to get a great many more.&nbsp; Emma assisted with her invention,

<P>memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,

<P>it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form

<P>as well as quantity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,

<P>and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.

<P>"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young-- he

<P>wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."

<P>And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,

<P>did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;

<P>but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about

<P>so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of

<P>Highbury in general should be put under requisition.&nbsp; Mr. Elton

<P>was the only one whose assistance she asked.&nbsp; He was invited

<P>to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums

<P>that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him

<P>most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,

<P>as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,

<P>nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass

<P>his lips.&nbsp; They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;

<P>and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,

<P>and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first doth affliction denote,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which my second is destin'd to feel

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my whole is the best antidote

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That affliction to soften and heal.--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it

<P>some pages ago already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said she;

<P>"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be

<P>easier to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind

<P>in his life.&nbsp; The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss

<P>Woodhouse"--he stopt a moment-- "or Miss Smith could inspire him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.

<P>He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the

<P>table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had

<P>addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,

<P>from his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he.

<P>"Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree

<P>to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma

<P>could understand.&nbsp; There was deep consciousness about him,

<P>and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's.

<P>He was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards

<P>Harriet--"it is for you.&nbsp; Take your own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,

<P>never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Miss--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHARADE.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lords of the earth! their luxury and
ease.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another view of man, my second brings,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold him there, the monarch of the
seas!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah! united, what reverse we have!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's boasted power and freedom, all
are flown;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May its approval beam in that soft eye!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through

<P>again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then

<P>passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,

<P>while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion

<P>of hope and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed.

<P>I have read worse charades.&nbsp; Courtship--a very good hint.&nbsp;
I give

<P>you credit for it.&nbsp; This is feeling your way.&nbsp; This is saying
very

<P>plainly-- `Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you.

<P>Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May its approval beam in that soft eye!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet exactly.&nbsp; Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets,

<P>the justest that could be given.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better.&nbsp; A man must be very
much

<P>in love, indeed, to describe her so.&nbsp; Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish

<P>you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you.

<P>For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken.

<P>An excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose.

<P>Things must come to a crisis soon now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,

<P>which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the

<P>eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I

<P>cannot guess it in the least.&nbsp; What can it possibly be? Do try

<P>to find it out, Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; Do help me.&nbsp; I never saw
any thing

<P>so hard.&nbsp; Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could

<P>be the young lady.&nbsp; Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Can it be Neptune?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold him there, the monarch of the
seas!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only

<P>one syllable.&nbsp; It must be very clever, or he would not have brought
it.

<P>Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you

<P>thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made

<P>by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lords of the earth! their luxury and
ease.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That is court.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another view of man, my second brings;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold him there, the monarch of the
seas!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That is ship;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse
we have!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's boasted power and freedom, all
are flown.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application,

<P>which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty

<P>in comprehending.&nbsp; Read it in comfort to yourself.&nbsp; There
can

<P>be no doubt of its being written for you and to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion.

<P>She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness.

<P>She could not speak.&nbsp; But she was not wanted to speak.&nbsp; It
was enough

<P>for her to feel.&nbsp; Emma spoke for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,"

<P>said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions.

<P>You are his object-- and you will soon receive the completest proof

<P>of it.&nbsp; I thought it must be so.&nbsp; I thought I could not be
so deceived;

<P>but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,

<P>as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you.

<P>Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance

<P>to happen what has happened.&nbsp; I could never tell whether an attachment

<P>between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural.

<P>Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each

<P>other! I am very happy.&nbsp; I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with
all

<P>my heart.&nbsp; This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride

<P>in creating.&nbsp; This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.

<P>It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence,

<P>a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,

<P>close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.

<P>This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either

<P>of us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear Miss Woodhouse!"--and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all that Harriet,

<P>with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they

<P>did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently

<P>clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered

<P>just as she ought.&nbsp; Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore

<P>I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could

<P>not have imagined it.&nbsp; It is so much beyond any thing I deserve.

<P>Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions

<P>about him.&nbsp; He is so very superior.&nbsp; Only think of those sweet

<P>verses--"To Miss --------." Dear me, how clever!--Could it really

<P>be meant for me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that.

<P>It is a certainty.&nbsp; Receive it on my judgment.&nbsp; It is a sort

<P>of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon

<P>followed by matter-of-fact prose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected.&nbsp; I am
sure,

<P>a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do

<P>take place!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and

<P>really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is

<P>so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement

<P>of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper
form.

<P>You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong

<P>to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes.

<P>Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.&nbsp; There does

<P>seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love

<P>exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel

<P>where it ought to flow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The course of true love never did run
smooth--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,

<P>who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,

<P>the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body

<P>looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,

<P>that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he

<P>does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days

<P>in the week.&nbsp; And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put
down

<P>all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury.

<P>Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little

<P>did I think!-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and

<P>peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss

<P>Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;

<P>however, she called me back presently, and let me look too,

<P>which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!

<P>He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,

<P>must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;

<P>and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.&nbsp; If they

<P>are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose amiable

<P>character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you

<P>settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen

<P>to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only

<P>object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married,

<P>here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment,

<P>the rise in the world which must satisfy them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very true.&nbsp; How nicely you talk; I love to hear you.

<P>You understand every thing.&nbsp; You and Mr. Elton are one as clever

<P>as the other.&nbsp; This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,

<P>I could never have made any thing like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining

<P>it yesterday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is as long again as almost all we have had before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour.

<P>Such things in general cannot be too short."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear.&nbsp; The most satisfactory

<P>comparisons were rising in her mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is one thing," said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--"to

<P>have very good sense in a common way, like every body else,

<P>and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,

<P>and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write

<P>verses and charades like this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's
prose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet--"these two last!--But

<P>how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found

<P>it out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Leave it to me.&nbsp; You do nothing.&nbsp; He will be here this evening,

<P>I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense

<P>or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your

<P>soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming.&nbsp; Trust to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful

<P>charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you

<P>should not write it into your book."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! but those two lines are"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>--"The best of all.&nbsp; Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private

<P>enjoyment keep them.&nbsp; They are not at all the less written you
know,

<P>because you divide them.&nbsp; The couplet does not cease to be, nor
does

<P>its meaning change.&nbsp; But take it away, and all appropriation ceases,

<P>and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.

<P>Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,

<P>much better than his passion.&nbsp; A poet in love must be encouraged
in

<P>both capacities, or neither.&nbsp; Give me the book, I will write it
down,

<P>and then there can be no possible reflection on you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,

<P>so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down

<P>a declaration of love.&nbsp; It seemed too precious an offering for
any

<P>degree of publicity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longer

<P>it lasts, the better I shall be pleased.&nbsp; But here is my father

<P>coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him.

<P>It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of

<P>the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment.

<P>He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!-- You must

<P>let me read it to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet looked grave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this

<P>charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are

<P>too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,

<P>or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.

<P>Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.

<P>If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper

<P>while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you.

<P>Do not let us be too solemn on the business.&nbsp; He has encouragement

<P>enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.&nbsp; Do as you
please."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,

<P>by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears,

<P>how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh.

<P>A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,

<P>we suppose, by a fairy)-- containing a very pretty charade, and we

<P>have just copied it in."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,

<P>slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations

<P>of every part as she proceeded-- and he was very much pleased, and,

<P>as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said.

<P>Very true.&nbsp; `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade,

<P>my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.-- Nobody

<P>could have written so prettily, but you, Emma."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking,

<P>and a very tender sigh, he added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother

<P>was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I

<P>can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you

<P>have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza;

<P>and there are several.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindled a flame I yet deplore,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though of his near approach afraid,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So fatal to my suit before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever

<P>all the way through.&nbsp; But I think, my dear, you said you had got
it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.&nbsp; We copied it

<P>from the Elegant Extracts.&nbsp; It was Garrick's, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near

<P>being christened Catherine after her grandmama.&nbsp; I hope we shall

<P>have her here next week.&nbsp; Have you thought, my dear, where you

<P>shall put her--and what room there will be for the children?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always

<P>has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual,

<P>you know.&nbsp; Why should there be any change?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not

<P>since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's

<P>being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly

<P>taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,

<P>not to see Miss Taylor here!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know, my dear.&nbsp; I am sure I was very much surprized

<P>when I first heard she was going to be married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella

<P>is here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she

<P>is coming for only one week.&nbsp; There will not be time for any thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case

<P>of necessity.&nbsp; Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the
28th,

<P>and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole

<P>of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days

<P>are not to be taken out for the Abbey.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley promises

<P>to give up his claim this Christmas-- though you know it is longer

<P>since they were with him, than with us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were

<P>to be anywhere but at Hartfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on

<P>his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own.

<P>He sat musing a little while, and then said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back

<P>so soon, though he does.&nbsp; I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade

<P>her to stay longer with us.&nbsp; She and the children might stay very
well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,

<P>and I do not think you ever will.&nbsp; Isabella cannot bear to stay

<P>behind her husband."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was too true for contradiction.&nbsp; Unwelcome as it was, Mr.
Woodhouse

<P>could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits

<P>affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband,

<P>she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while

<P>my brother and sister are here.&nbsp; I am sure she will be pleased

<P>with the children.&nbsp; We are very proud of the children, are not
we,

<P>papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, I wonder which she will.&nbsp; Poor little dears, how glad they

<P>will be to come.&nbsp; They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say they are, sir.&nbsp; I am sure I do not know who is not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.&nbsp; Henry is
the eldest,

<P>he was named after me, not after his father.&nbsp; John, the second,

<P>is named after his father.&nbsp; Some people are surprized, I believe,

<P>that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry,

<P>which I thought very pretty of her.&nbsp; And he is a very clever boy,

<P>indeed.&nbsp; They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many

<P>pretty ways.&nbsp; They will come and stand by my chair, and say,

<P>`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked me

<P>for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas.

<P>I think their father is too rough with them very often."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so very

<P>gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas,

<P>you would not think him rough.&nbsp; He wishes his boys to be active
and hardy;

<P>and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;

<P>but he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley

<P>is an affectionate father.&nbsp; The children are all fond of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling

<P>in a very frightful way!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much.

<P>It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down

<P>the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way

<P>to the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I cannot understand it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is the case with us all, papa.&nbsp; One half of the world cannot

<P>understand the pleasures of the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate

<P>in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero

<P>of this inimitable charade walked in again.&nbsp; Harriet turned away;

<P>but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye

<P>soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of

<P>having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it

<P>might turn up.&nbsp; His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether

<P>Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him,

<P>or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield.

<P>If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend

<P>Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made

<P>such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his

<P>friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber.

<P>He re-urged --she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make

<P>his bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;

<P>thank you for the sight of it.&nbsp; We admired it so much, that I have

<P>ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection.&nbsp; Your friend

<P>will not take it amiss I hope.&nbsp; Of course I have not transcribed

<P>beyond the first eight lines."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.

<P>He looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about

<P>"honour,"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book

<P>open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.

<P>With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade

<P>must not be confined to one or two.&nbsp; He may be sure of every woman's

<P>approbation while he writes with such gallantry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating

<P>a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation in saying--at

<P>least if my friend feels at all as I do--I have not the smallest

<P>doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it,

<P>(looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he

<P>would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible.&nbsp; Emma could
not

<P>think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities,

<P>there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt

<P>to incline her to laugh.&nbsp; She ran away to indulge the inclination,

<P>leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.
