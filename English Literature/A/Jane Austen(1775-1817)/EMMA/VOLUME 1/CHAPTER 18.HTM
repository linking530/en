<P>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come.&nbsp; When the time proposed

<P>drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival

<P>of a letter of excuse.&nbsp; For the present, he could not be spared,

<P>to his "very great mortification and regret; but still he looked

<P>forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed,

<P>in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the

<P>young man had been so much more sober:&nbsp; but a sanguine temper,

<P>though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not

<P>always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.

<P>It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.

<P>For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he

<P>began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later

<P>would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;

<P>and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably

<P>longer with them than if he had come sooner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston,

<P>of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition

<P>of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband

<P>was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really

<P>about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment

<P>at Randalls.&nbsp; The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.

<P>She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as
it

<P>was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,

<P>she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,

<P>and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment,

<P>as might naturally belong to their friendship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed

<P>quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps

<P>rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.

<P>She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the

<P>advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry;

<P>the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,

<P>which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections

<P>on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a

<P>disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement,

<P>perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her

<P>real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley,

<P>coolly; "but I dare say he might come if he would."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know why you should say so.&nbsp; He wishes exceedingly to
come;

<P>but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made

<P>a point of it.&nbsp; It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without
proof."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How odd you are!&nbsp; What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you

<P>suppose him such an unnatural creature?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting

<P>that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care

<P>very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with

<P>those who have always set him the example of it.&nbsp; It is a great
deal

<P>more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up

<P>by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud,

<P>luxurious, and selfish too.&nbsp; If Frank Churchill had wanted to see

<P>his father, he would have contrived it between September and January.

<P>A man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be

<P>without the means of doing as much as that.&nbsp; It is impossible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always

<P>been your own master.&nbsp; You are the worst judge in the world,

<P>Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.&nbsp; You do not know

<P>what it is to have tempers to manage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty

<P>should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.&nbsp; He cannot

<P>want money--he cannot want leisure.&nbsp; We know, on the contrary,

<P>that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at

<P>the idlest haunts in the kingdom.&nbsp; We hear of him for ever at some

<P>watering-place or other.&nbsp; A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.

<P>This proves that he can leave the Churchills."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sometimes he can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while;

<P>whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an

<P>intimate knowledge of their situation.&nbsp; Nobody, who has not been

<P>in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties

<P>of any individual of that family may be.&nbsp; We ought to be

<P>acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper,

<P>before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do.

<P>He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,

<P>and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour

<P>and resolution.&nbsp; It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention

<P>to his father.&nbsp; He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages;

<P>but if he wished to do it, it might be done.&nbsp; A man who felt rightly

<P>would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--

<P>`Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make

<P>to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately.

<P>I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him

<P>on the present occasion.&nbsp; I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--

<P>If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming

<P>a man, there would be no opposition made to his going."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made to
his

<P>coming back again.&nbsp; Such language for a young man entirely dependent,

<P>to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible.

<P>But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly

<P>opposite to your own.&nbsp; Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such

<P>a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up,

<P>and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room,

<P>I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine

<P>such conduct practicable?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.

<P>He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made,

<P>of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--

<P>would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger

<P>with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts

<P>and expedients can ever do.&nbsp; Respect would be added to affection.

<P>They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had

<P>done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know,

<P>as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he

<P>ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting

<P>their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better

<P>of him for submitting to their whims.&nbsp; Respect for right conduct

<P>is felt by every body.&nbsp; If he would act in this sort of manner,

<P>on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend

<P>to his."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I rather doubt that.&nbsp; You are very fond of bending little minds;

<P>but where little minds belong to rich people in authority,

<P>I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as

<P>unmanageable as great ones.&nbsp; I can imagine, that if you, as you
are,

<P>Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in

<P>Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do

<P>just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have

<P>a very good effect.&nbsp; The Churchills might not have a word to say

<P>in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience

<P>and long observance to break through.&nbsp; To him who has, it might

<P>not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence,

<P>and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.

<P>He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,

<P>without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up

<P>to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then it would not be so strong a sense.&nbsp; If it failed to produce

<P>equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, the difference of situation and habit!&nbsp; I wish you would try

<P>to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel

<P>in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been

<P>looking up to all his life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first

<P>occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against

<P>the will of others.&nbsp; It ought to have been a habit with him by

<P>this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.

<P>I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.

<P>As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off

<P>all that was unworthy in their authority.&nbsp; He ought to have opposed

<P>the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.

<P>Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We shall never agree about him," cried Emma; "but that is

<P>nothing extraordinary.&nbsp; I have not the least idea of his being

<P>a weak young man:&nbsp; I feel sure that he is not.&nbsp; Mr. Weston
would

<P>not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely

<P>to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit

<P>your notions of man's perfection.&nbsp; I dare say he has; and though

<P>it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,

<P>and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself

<P>extremely expert in finding excuses for it.&nbsp; He can sit down and

<P>write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods,

<P>and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method

<P>in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's

<P>having any right to complain.&nbsp; His letters disgust me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your feelings are singular.&nbsp; They seem to satisfy every body else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; They hardly can

<P>satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings:&nbsp; standing
in

<P>a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her.

<P>It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,

<P>and she must doubly feel the omission.&nbsp; Had she been a person

<P>of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would

<P>not have signified whether he did or no.&nbsp; Can you think your friend

<P>behindhand in these sort of considerations?&nbsp; Do you suppose she

<P>does not often say all this to herself?&nbsp; No, Emma, your amiable

<P>young man can be amiable only in French, not in English.&nbsp; He may
be

<P>very `aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he

<P>can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:

<P>nothing really amiable about him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You seem determined to think ill of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!--not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I do

<P>not want to think ill of him.&nbsp; I should be as ready to acknowledge

<P>his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are

<P>merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,

<P>plausible manners."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a

<P>treasure at Highbury.&nbsp; We do not often look upon fine young men,

<P>well-bred and agreeable.&nbsp; We must not be nice and ask for all

<P>the virtues into the bargain.&nbsp; Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,

<P>what a sensation his coming will produce?&nbsp; There will be but one
subject

<P>throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--

<P>one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;

<P>we shall think and speak of nobody else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him

<P>conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only

<P>a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste

<P>of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being

<P>universally agreeable.&nbsp; To you, he will talk of farming; to me,

<P>of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general

<P>information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,

<P>or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak

<P>extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he turn out any

<P>thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!

<P>What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--

<P>the practised politician, who is to read every body's character,

<P>and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his

<P>own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he

<P>may make all appear like fools compared with himself!&nbsp; My dear
Emma,

<P>your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came

<P>to the point."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will say no more about him," cried Emma, "you turn every

<P>thing to evil.&nbsp; We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him;

<P>and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Prejudiced!&nbsp; I am not prejudiced."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it.

<P>My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in

<P>his favour."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"

<P>said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma

<P>immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend

<P>why he should be angry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be

<P>of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real

<P>liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;

<P>for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid

<P>to his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could

<P>make him unjust to the merit of another.
