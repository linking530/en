<P>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,

<P>a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured

<P>of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept

<P>another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she

<P>had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.

<P>A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no

<P>sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,

<P>than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--

<P>that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,

<P>and was now forming all her views of happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:

<P>but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,

<P>and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die

<P>away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,

<P>and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to

<P>her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of

<P>that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--

<P>Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at

<P>Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all

<P>with the utmost delight.&nbsp; But what did such particulars explain?--

<P>The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had

<P>always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had

<P>been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible

<P>to Emma.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her

<P>fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.

<P>She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford

<P>her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent

<P>enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood

<P>of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--

<P>It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many

<P>a gentleman:&nbsp; but what a connexion had she been preparing for

<P>Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--

<P>The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,

<P>would have been a stain indeed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was

<P>treated liberally; it was all as it should be:&nbsp; and as Emma became

<P>acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,

<P>she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth

<P>which could bid fairest for her little friend.&nbsp; She had no doubt

<P>of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,

<P>and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,

<P>of security, stability, and improvement.&nbsp; She would be placed in
the

<P>midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;

<P>retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.

<P>She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her
out.

<P>She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be

<P>the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and

<P>persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,

<P>to yield only to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,

<P>was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--

<P>The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must

<P>change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought

<P>to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,

<P>natural manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw

<P>her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,

<P>as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood

<P>before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she

<P>scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the

<P>altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,

<P>the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the

<P>comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills

<P>were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,

<P>by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage

<P>ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,

<P>to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,

<P>which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,

<P>were agreed in approving it.&nbsp; But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse

<P>to be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their

<P>marriage but as a distant event.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they

<P>were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--

<P>He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--

<P>a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.

<P>Still, however, he was not happy.&nbsp; Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,

<P>that his daughter's courage failed.&nbsp; She could not bear to see

<P>him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though

<P>her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the

<P>Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress

<P>would be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden

<P>illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his

<P>nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--

<P>Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--

<P>evidently by the ingenuity of man.&nbsp; Other poultry-yards in the

<P>neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was housebreaking to

<P>Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense

<P>of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm

<P>every night of his life.&nbsp; The strength, resolution, and presence

<P>of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.

<P>While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--

<P>But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the

<P>first week in November.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,

<P>cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at

<P>the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was

<P>called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert

<P>Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties

<P>have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the

<P>particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,

<P>and very inferior to her own.--"Very little white satin, very few

<P>lace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she

<P>heard of it."--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,

<P>the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band

<P>of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered

<P>in the perfect happiness of the union.
