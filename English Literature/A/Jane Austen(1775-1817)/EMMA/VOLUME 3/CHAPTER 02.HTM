<P>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.&nbsp; The day approached,

<P>the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,

<P>Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls

<P>before dinner, and every thing was safe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.

<P>The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better

<P>than a common meeting in a crowd.&nbsp; Mr. Weston had been so very

<P>earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible

<P>after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the

<P>propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,

<P>that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet

<P>interval in the young man's company.&nbsp; She was to convey Harriet,

<P>and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just

<P>sufficiently before them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though

<P>he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have

<P>a delightful evening.&nbsp; They all walked about together, to see

<P>that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes

<P>were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma

<P>could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.

<P>"So unreasonably early!" she was going to exclaim; but she presently

<P>found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,

<P>by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were

<P>so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been

<P>entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,

<P>on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might

<P>soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which

<P>Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and

<P>intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,

<P>was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.

<P>She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness

<P>would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,

<P>but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--

<P>She could fancy such a man.&nbsp; The whole party walked about,

<P>and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,

<P>formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their

<P>various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May,

<P>a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number

<P>of privy councillors was not yet larger.&nbsp; They had stopped

<P>at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage,

<P>but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,

<P>which shewed a mind not at ease.&nbsp; He was looking about, he was
going

<P>to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--

<P>impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton was spoken of.&nbsp; "I think she must be here soon," said
he.

<P>"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much

<P>of her.&nbsp; It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A carriage was heard.&nbsp; He was on the move immediately;

<P>but coming back, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.&nbsp; I have never
seen

<P>either Mr. or Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; I have no business to put myself forward."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties
passed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about.

<P>"We thought you were to bring them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mistake had been slight.&nbsp; The carriage was sent for them now.

<P>Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton

<P>might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,

<P>and her smiles of graciousness.&nbsp; He was immediately qualifying

<P>himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,

<P>after the introduction had passed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--

<P>"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father:

<P>"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:"&nbsp; and away he went.&nbsp; Mr.
Weston

<P>was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her

<P>opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young

<P>man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out

<P>of hearing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.&nbsp; You know I candidly
told

<P>you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am

<P>extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.&nbsp; I never compliment.

<P>I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely

<P>what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least

<P>conceit or puppyism.&nbsp; You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--

<P>quite a horror of them.&nbsp; They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.

<P>Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we

<P>used sometimes to say very cutting things!&nbsp; Selina, who is mild
almost

<P>to a fault, bore with them much better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;

<P>but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were

<P>ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must

<P>hurry away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "I have no doubt of its being

<P>our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.&nbsp; Our coachman and horses
are

<P>so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--

<P>What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--

<P>I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it

<P>will be quite unnecessary.&nbsp; You may be very sure I shall always

<P>take care of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,

<P>walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much

<P>her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them.&nbsp; Her gestures and

<P>movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;

<P>but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the

<P>incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not

<P>finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted

<P>into the circle at the fire.&nbsp; As the door opened she was heard,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.&nbsp; Nothing to signify.

<P>I do not care for myself.&nbsp; Quite thick shoes.&nbsp; And Jane declares--

<P>Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!&nbsp; This is brilliant

<P>indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.

<P>Nothing wanting.&nbsp; Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted
up!--

<P>Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Weston,

<P>you must really have had Aladdin's lamp.&nbsp; Good Mrs. Stokes

<P>would not know her own room again.&nbsp; I saw her as I came in;

<P>she was standing in the entrance.&nbsp; `Oh!&nbsp; Mrs. Stokes,' said
I--

<P>but I had not time for more."&nbsp; She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--

<P>"Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.

<P>Very happy to hear it.&nbsp; So afraid you might have a headach!--

<P>seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.

<P>Delighted to hear it indeed.&nbsp; Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged

<P>to you for the carriage!--excellent time.&nbsp; Jane and I quite ready.

<P>Did not keep the horses a moment.&nbsp; Most comfortable carriage.--

<P>Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.

<P>Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--

<P>But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.

<P>I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am--.'&nbsp; Thank you, my mother

<P>is remarkably well.&nbsp; Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take

<P>her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--

<P>Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!

<P>Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice.&nbsp; There were

<P>three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.

<P>Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.&nbsp; My dear Jane,

<P>are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,

<P>but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--

<P>and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his

<P>extreme politeness.--Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you

<P>my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet

<P>never came out again.&nbsp; My mother often talks of your good-nature.

<P>Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--

<P>Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--

<P>Very well I thank you, quite well.&nbsp; This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--

<P>Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma

<P>most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--

<P>She did it all herself.&nbsp; Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--

<P>No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--

<P>and Mrs. Hughes.&nbsp; Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for

<P>a moment.--How do you do?&nbsp; How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.

<P>This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--

<P>Oh! there he is.&nbsp; Don't disturb him.&nbsp; Much better employed
talking

<P>to the young ladies.&nbsp; How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the

<P>other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--

<P>and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host

<P>of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?&nbsp; How
do

<P>you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; Never better.--

<P>Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the

<P>worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about

<P>among such friends!&nbsp; And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.

<P>No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea

<P>if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.

<P>Every thing so good!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss

<P>Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the

<P>discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little

<P>way behind her.--He was thoughtful.&nbsp; Whether he were overhearing
too,

<P>she could not determine.&nbsp; After a good many compliments to Jane

<P>on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,

<P>Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--

<P>and it was, "How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--

<P>How has Wright done my hair?"--with many other relative questions,

<P>all answered with patient politeness.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton then said,

<P>"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such

<P>an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,

<P>and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving

<P>this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior

<P>to others.&nbsp; And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--

<P>So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see

<P>if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.

<P>I like him very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could

<P>not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want

<P>to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,

<P>till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly

<P>forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--

<P>I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be

<P>impatient for tidings of us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jane!"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--

<P>"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are ungrateful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?"&nbsp; Then changing from a frown to

<P>a smile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--

<P>Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.

<P>He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; He had met with them in a little perplexity,

<P>which must be laid before Emma.&nbsp; It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston

<P>that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would

<P>expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma

<P>that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston.

<P>"She will think Frank ought to ask her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;

<P>and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most

<P>perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was

<P>wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business

<P>was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--

<P>Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss

<P>Woodhouse followed.&nbsp; Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,

<P>though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.

<P>It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton
had

<P>undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;

<P>for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could

<P>not lose by the change.&nbsp; Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.--

<P>In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,

<P>delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,

<P>and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--

<P>She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any

<P>thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not

<P>to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,

<P>and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest

<P>in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--

<P>He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,

<P>than where he had placed himself.&nbsp; His tall, firm, upright figure,

<P>among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,

<P>was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her

<P>own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men

<P>who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,

<P>and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike

<P>a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he

<P>but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him

<P>to smile; but in general he was looking grave.&nbsp; She wished he could

<P>love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--

<P>He seemed often observing her.&nbsp; She must not flatter herself that
he

<P>thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,

<P>she did not feel afraid.&nbsp; There was nothing like flirtation between

<P>her and her partner.&nbsp; They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,

<P>than lovers.&nbsp; That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he
had done,

<P>was indubitable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ball proceeded pleasantly.&nbsp; The anxious cares, the incessant

<P>attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.&nbsp; Every body

<P>seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,

<P>which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,

<P>was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.

<P>Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive

<P>than such meetings usually are.&nbsp; There was one, however, which
Emma

<P>thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,

<P>and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--

<P>and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there

<P>could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder

<P>lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.

<P>He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:

<P>she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to

<P>escape into the card-room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Escape, however, was not his plan.&nbsp; He came to the part of the
room

<P>where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about

<P>in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution

<P>of maintaining it.&nbsp; He did not omit being sometimes directly

<P>before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--

<P>Emma saw it.&nbsp; She was not yet dancing; she was working her way

<P>up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,

<P>and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.&nbsp; When she
was

<P>half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she

<P>would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,

<P>that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took

<P>place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,

<P>who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,

<P>but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,

<P>gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, "Do not

<P>you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his prompt reply was, "Most readily,

<P>Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.

<P>I am no dancer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have great pleasure,

<P>I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married
man,

<P>and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great

<P>pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady

<P>disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith."

<P>"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--

<P>and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,

<P>Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; You will excuse me.&nbsp; Any thing else I should
be most happy

<P>to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what

<P>surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat.

<P>This was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--

<P>She looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a

<P>little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,

<P>while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She would not look again.&nbsp; Her heart was in a glow, and she feared

<P>her face might be as hot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley

<P>leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,

<P>seldom more delighted, than at that instant.&nbsp; She was all pleasure

<P>and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be

<P>thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance

<P>said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,

<P>extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,

<P>if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for

<P>the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction

<P>which her happy features announced.&nbsp; It was not thrown away on
her,

<P>she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,

<P>and was in a continual course of smiles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)

<P>very foolish.&nbsp; She did not think he was quite so hardened as his
wife,

<P>though growing very like her;--she spoke some of her feelings,

<P>by observing audibly to her partner,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,

<P>I declare."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Supper was announced.&nbsp; The move began; and Miss Bates might be

<P>heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being

<P>seated at table and taking up her spoon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.

<P>Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.&nbsp; She says she is afraid

<P>there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has

<P>been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,

<P>indeed you must.&nbsp; Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!

<P>How well you put it on!--so gratified!&nbsp; Excellent dancing indeed!--

<P>Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama

<P>to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without

<P>saying a word, just as I told you.&nbsp; Grandmama was quite well,

<P>had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,

<P>and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples

<P>and wine before she came away:&nbsp; amazing luck in some of her throws:

<P>and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,

<P>and who were your partners.&nbsp; `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall
Jane;

<P>I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you

<P>all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,

<P>I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'

<P>My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would

<P>not rather?--I am not helpless.&nbsp; Sir, you are most kind.&nbsp;
Upon my word,

<P>Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand

<P>a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant

<P>she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.

<P>Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.

<P>Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.&nbsp; Oh! no, there is

<P>but one.&nbsp; Well, I was persuaded there were two.&nbsp; How very
odd!

<P>I was convinced there were two, and there is but one.&nbsp; I never
saw any

<P>thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling

<P>you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--

<P>The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;

<P>but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus

<P>brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the

<P>asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.&nbsp; Now there

<P>is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--

<P>so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of
it

<P>to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,

<P>who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!

<P>I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such

<P>elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--

<P>Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?&nbsp; Anywhere, so that

<P>Jane is not in a draught.&nbsp; Where I sit is of no consequence.

<P>Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--

<P>only it seems too good--but just as you please.&nbsp; What you direct

<P>in this house cannot be wrong.&nbsp; Dear Jane, how shall we ever

<P>recollect half the dishes for grandmama?&nbsp; Soup too!&nbsp; Bless
me!

<P>I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I

<P>cannot help beginning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till

<P>after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,

<P>her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.

<P>He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been

<P>unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due

<P>share of censure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he.&nbsp; "Emma, why

<P>is it that they are your enemies?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving

<P>no answer, added, "She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,

<P>whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;

<P>but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,

<P>and he only said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall not scold you.&nbsp; I leave you to your own reflections."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever

<P>tell me I am wrong?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads

<P>you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.

<P>There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I

<P>did not:&nbsp; and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.

<P>It was through a series of strange blunders!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice

<P>to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen
for

<P>himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton

<P>is totally without.&nbsp; An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--

<P>infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such

<P>a woman as Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; I found Harriet more conversable than I
expected."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle

<P>of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--

<P>Come Emma, set your companions the example.&nbsp; Every body is lazy!

<P>Every body is asleep!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will

<P>ask me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed I will.&nbsp; You have shewn that you can dance, and you know
we

<P>are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Brother and sister! no, indeed."
