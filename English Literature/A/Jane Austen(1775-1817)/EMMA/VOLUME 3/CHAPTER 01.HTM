<P>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the

<P>nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.

<P>She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at

<P>all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.&nbsp; Her own attachment

<P>had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--

<P>but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love

<P>of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment

<P>which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.&nbsp; If a separation

<P>of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils

<P>before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.

<P>She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,

<P>and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.

<P>That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!

<P>and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.

<P>She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,

<P>an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,

<P>before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's

<P>feelings.&nbsp; The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as
had

<P>been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.&nbsp; He
rode

<P>down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came

<P>from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all

<P>her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,

<P>and how she must act.&nbsp; They met with the utmost friendliness.

<P>There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her.

<P>But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he

<P>had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.

<P>She watched him well.&nbsp; It was a clear thing he was less in love
than he

<P>had been.&nbsp; Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,

<P>had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed

<P>delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories:

<P>and he was not without agitation.&nbsp; It was not in his calmness that

<P>she read his comparative difference.&nbsp; He was not calm; his spirits

<P>were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.

<P>Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;

<P>but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a

<P>quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.

<P>"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--

<P>he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he

<P>had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,

<P>and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off."

<P>She had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his

<P>agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;

<P>and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her

<P>returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself

<P>with her long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.

<P>He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.

<P>His aunt could not bear to have him leave her.&nbsp; Such was his own
account

<P>at Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,

<P>it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had

<P>been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.

<P>That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself

<P>convinced of it, at Randalls.&nbsp; Though much might be fancy, he could

<P>not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state

<P>of health than she had been half a year ago.&nbsp; He did not believe
it

<P>to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,

<P>or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;

<P>but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say

<P>that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong

<P>as ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.&nbsp; She could

<P>not endure its noise.&nbsp; Her nerves were under continual irritation

<P>and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to

<P>Randalls communicated a change of plan.&nbsp; They were going to remove

<P>immediately to Richmond.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchill had been recommended

<P>to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise

<P>a fancy for the place.&nbsp; A ready-furnished house in a favourite

<P>spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,

<P>and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two

<P>months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--

<P>for the house was taken for May and June.&nbsp; She was told that now

<P>he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,

<P>almost as often as he could even wish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.&nbsp; He
was

<P>considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.

<P>She hoped it was not so.&nbsp; Two months must bring it to the proof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable.&nbsp; He was quite delighted.

<P>It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.&nbsp; Now, it
would

<P>be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; What were nine
miles

<P>to a young man?--An hour's ride.&nbsp; He would be always coming over.

<P>The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough

<P>to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing

<P>him never.&nbsp; Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen

<P>to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.&nbsp; Were he ever able

<P>to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.

<P>There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be

<P>at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.

<P>Better than nearer!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--

<P>the ball at the Crown.&nbsp; It had not been forgotten before, but it
had

<P>been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.&nbsp; Now, however,

<P>it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon

<P>after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,

<P>to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,

<P>and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four

<P>hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.&nbsp; A very few to-morrows

<P>stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned.&nbsp; The time of year lightened the evil

<P>to him.&nbsp; May was better for every thing than February.&nbsp; Mrs.
Bates

<P>was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,

<P>and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear

<P>little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear

<P>Emma were gone.
