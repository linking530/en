<P>"Harriet, poor Harriet!"--Those were the words; in them lay the

<P>tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted

<P>the real misery of the business to her.&nbsp; Frank Churchill had behaved

<P>very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much

<P>his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him.

<P>It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account,

<P>that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second

<P>time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley

<P>had spoken prophetically, when he once said, "Emma, you have been

<P>no friend to Harriet Smith."--She was afraid she had done her nothing

<P>but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,

<P>in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original

<P>author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might

<P>otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet

<P>had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill

<P>before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt

<P>completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.

<P>She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.

<P>Her influence would have been enough.&nbsp; And now she was very conscious

<P>that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been

<P>risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.

<P>Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she

<P>must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five

<P>hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--"But, with

<P>common sense," she added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was extremely angry with herself.&nbsp; If she could not have been

<P>angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--

<P>As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings

<P>from any present solicitude on her account.&nbsp; Harriet would

<P>be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,

<P>whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,

<P>must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil

<P>were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--

<P>Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.

<P>This discovery laid many smaller matters open.&nbsp; No doubt it had
been

<P>from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might

<P>any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.

<P>An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,

<P>and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.

<P>She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself

<P>from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged

<P>that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond

<P>her desert.&nbsp; But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!

<P>There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.

<P>Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be

<P>more severe than the first.&nbsp; Considering the very superior claims

<P>of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect

<P>on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--

<P>She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon

<P>as possible.&nbsp; An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's

<P>parting words.&nbsp; "For the present, the whole affair was to be

<P>completely a secret.&nbsp; Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,

<P>as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;

<P>and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum."--

<P>Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.&nbsp; It was
her

<P>superior duty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,

<P>that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to

<P>perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.

<P>The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,

<P>she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.&nbsp; Her heart beat

<P>quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed,

<P>had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was approaching Randalls.

<P>Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--

<P>But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse!" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--

<P>"is not this the oddest news that ever was?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What news do you mean?" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look

<P>or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"About Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; Did you ever hear any thing so strange?

<P>Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has

<P>told me himself.&nbsp; I met him just now.&nbsp; He told me it was to
be

<P>a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning

<P>it to any body but you, but he said you knew it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What did Mr. Weston tell you?"--said Emma, still perplexed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank

<P>Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately

<P>engaged to one another this long while.&nbsp; How very odd!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,

<P>that Emma did not know how to understand it.&nbsp; Her character appeared

<P>absolutely changed.&nbsp; She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,

<P>or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.&nbsp; Emma
looked

<P>at her, quite unable to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Had you any idea," cried Harriet, "of his being in love

<P>with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)

<P>who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word," said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such talent.

<P>Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached

<P>to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--

<P>encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had

<P>the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank

<P>Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; You may
be

<P>very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.&nbsp; "Why should you

<P>caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"

<P>replied Emma, smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there

<P>was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason

<P>to understand that you did care about him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Him!--never, never.&nbsp; Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake
me?"

<P>turning away distressed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Harriet!" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--"What do you mean?--

<P>Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she

<P>sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned

<P>from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,

<P>it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should not have thought it possible," she began, "that you

<P>could have misunderstood me!&nbsp; I know we agreed never to name him--

<P>but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,

<P>I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed

<P>to mean any other person.&nbsp; Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!&nbsp; I
do not

<P>know who would ever look at him in the company of the other.

<P>I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,

<P>who is like nobody by his side.&nbsp; And that you should have been

<P>so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you

<P>entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,

<P>I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,

<P>to dare to think of him.&nbsp; At first, if you had not told me

<P>that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been

<P>matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--

<P>I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought

<P>it possible--But if you, who had been always acquainted with him--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Harriet!" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--"Let us

<P>understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.

<P>Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure I am.&nbsp; I never could have an idea of any body else--

<P>and so I thought you knew.&nbsp; When we talked about him, it was as
clear

<P>as possible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite," returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that

<P>you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.

<P>I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill.

<P>I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,

<P>in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I

<P>said on the occasion.&nbsp; I told you that I did not wonder at

<P>your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,

<P>it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself

<P>very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning

<P>even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward

<P>to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, dear," cried Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I

<P>was thinking of something very different at the time.&nbsp; It was not

<P>the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.&nbsp; No!
(with

<P>some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--

<P>of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton

<P>would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in

<P>the room.&nbsp; That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence

<P>and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel

<P>how superior he was to every other being upon earth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good God!" cried Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate--

<P>most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?

<P>At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,

<P>if the other had been the person; and now--it is possible--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She paused a few moments.&nbsp; Emma could not speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse," she resumed, "that you should feel

<P>a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.

<P>You must think one five hundred million times more above me than

<P>the other.&nbsp; But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--

<P>strange as it may appear--.&nbsp; But you know they were your own words,

<P>that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity

<P>had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,

<P>it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--

<P>and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--

<P>if Mr. Knightley should really--if he does not mind the disparity,

<P>I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,

<P>and try to put difficulties in the way.&nbsp; But you are too good for
that,

<P>I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet was standing at one of the windows.&nbsp; Emma turned round

<P>to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--"I must say

<P>that I have."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,

<P>in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.&nbsp; A few minutes were sufficient

<P>for making her acquainted with her own heart.&nbsp; A mind like hers,

<P>once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.&nbsp; She touched--

<P>she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.&nbsp; Why was it

<P>so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,

<P>than with Frank Churchill?&nbsp; Why was the evil so dreadfully increased

<P>by Harriet's having some hope of a return?&nbsp; It darted through her,

<P>with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one

<P>but herself!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the

<P>same few minutes.&nbsp; She saw it all with a clearness which had

<P>never blessed her before.&nbsp; How improperly had she been acting

<P>by Harriet!&nbsp; How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,

<P>how unfeeling had been her conduct!&nbsp; What blindness, what madness,

<P>had led her on!&nbsp; It struck her with dreadful force, and she

<P>was ready to give it every bad name in the world.&nbsp; Some portion

<P>of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--

<P>some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice

<P>by Harriet--(there would be no need of compassion to the girl

<P>who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required

<P>that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)

<P>gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,

<P>with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit

<P>that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;

<P>and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest

<P>which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve

<P>to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--

<P>Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,

<P>she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed

<P>the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,

<P>the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--

<P>Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad

<P>to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,

<P>and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,

<P>to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling

<P>delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,

<P>were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.

<P>Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation

<P>that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,

<P>such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--

<P>She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward

<P>patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,

<P>or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;

<P>but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and

<P>tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--

<P>especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory

<P>brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since

<P>those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,

<P>found her much superior to his expectation.&nbsp; From that evening,

<P>or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her

<P>to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking

<P>to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having

<P>indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness

<P>and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.

<P>When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked

<P>by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be

<P>acquainted with her.&nbsp; Emma knew it to have been very much the case.

<P>She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--

<P>Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--

<P>and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had

<P>known of his opinion of Harriet.&nbsp; He praised her for being without

<P>art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--

<P>She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt

<P>on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory,

<P>many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,

<P>a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,

<P>a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,

<P>by Emma.&nbsp; Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,

<P>and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed

<P>undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences

<P>to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not

<P>without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,

<P>was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk

<P>at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,

<P>and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from

<P>the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more

<P>particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular

<P>way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed

<P>to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--

<P>But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,

<P>he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--

<P>The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour

<P>before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his

<P>being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said

<P>that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,

<P>during their conversation, that though he must go to London,

<P>it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,

<P>which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to her.

<P>The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one

<P>article marked, gave her severe pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,

<P>after a little reflection, venture the following question.

<P>"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,

<P>into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--

<P>he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?&nbsp; But Harriet rejected

<P>the suspicion with spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Martin!&nbsp; No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.

<P>I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be

<P>suspected of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear

<P>Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never should have presumed to think of it at first," said she,

<P>"but for you.&nbsp; You told me to observe him carefully, and let

<P>his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.&nbsp; But now I seem

<P>to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,

<P>it will not be any thing so very wonderful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter

<P>feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side,

<P>to enable her to say on reply,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is

<P>the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman

<P>the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;

<P>and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at

<P>that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her

<P>father's footsteps.&nbsp; He was coming through the hall.&nbsp; Harriet
was

<P>too much agitated to encounter him.&nbsp; "She could not compose herself--

<P>Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;"--with most ready

<P>encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through

<P>another door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous

<P>burst of Emma's feelings:&nbsp; "Oh God! that I had never seen her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough

<P>for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion

<P>of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.

<P>Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize

<P>must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!

<P>How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising

<P>on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her

<P>own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her

<P>own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,

<P>she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed

<P>on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing

<P>on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,

<P>and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the

<P>first endeavour.&nbsp; To that point went every leisure moment which
her

<P>father's claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary

<P>absence of mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling

<P>declared him now to be?&nbsp; When had his influence, such influence
begun?--

<P>When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank

<P>Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;

<P>she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in

<P>her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--

<P>and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--

<P>oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute

<P>the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she

<P>did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when

<P>his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.&nbsp; She
saw,

<P>that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,

<P>she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her

<P>own heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank

<P>Churchill at all!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.

<P>This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,

<P>which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--

<P>She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation

<P>but the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--

<P>Every other part of her mind was disgusting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every

<P>body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every

<P>body's destiny.&nbsp; She was proved to have been universally mistaken;

<P>and she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief.

<P>She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared,

<P>on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to

<P>take place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it

<P>a beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only

<P>by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case,

<P>he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every

<P>wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane

<P>Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison,

<P>exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing

<P>to be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an

<P>elevation on her side!&nbsp; Such a debasement on his!&nbsp; It was
horrible

<P>to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion,

<P>to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at

<P>his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand

<P>inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.

<P>And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new

<P>circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by

<P>very inferior powers?&nbsp; Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to
seek,

<P>to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any

<P>thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for

<P>chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward!&nbsp; Had she left her where

<P>she ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,

<P>with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying

<P>the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy

<P>and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong--

<P>all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise

<P>her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy

<P>herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--

<P>But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--

<P>Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--

<P>She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop

<P>in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.--

<P>Alas! was not that her own doing too?&nbsp; Who had been at pains to
give

<P>Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself

<P>had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,

<P>and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--

<P>If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.
