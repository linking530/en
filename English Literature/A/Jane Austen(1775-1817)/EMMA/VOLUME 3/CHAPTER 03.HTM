<P>This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable

<P>pleasure.&nbsp; It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,

<P>which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was

<P>extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting

<P>the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so

<P>much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,

<P>was peculiarly gratifying.&nbsp; The impertinence of the Eltons, which
for

<P>a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been

<P>the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked

<P>forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--

<P>From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they

<P>quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.&nbsp; It seemed as if her
eyes

<P>were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton

<P>was not the superior creature she had believed him.&nbsp; The fever

<P>was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being

<P>quickened again by injurious courtesy.&nbsp; She depended on the evil

<P>feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed

<P>neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,

<P>Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not

<P>wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before
her!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.&nbsp; He had told

<P>her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping

<P>at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.

<P>She did not regret it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them
all

<P>to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened
up

<P>for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,

<P>when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered

<P>whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,

<P>with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment

<P>sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.

<P>Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--

<P>The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--

<P>they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking

<P>into a chair fainted away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,

<P>and surprizes be explained.&nbsp; Such events are very interesting,

<P>but the suspense of them cannot last long.&nbsp; A few minutes made
Emma

<P>acquainted with the whole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at

<P>Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,

<P>and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public

<P>enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile

<P>beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms

<P>on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;

<P>and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,

<P>they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,

<P>on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.

<P>A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,

<P>excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet

<P>to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,

<P>and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.

<P>But poor Harriet could not follow.&nbsp; She had suffered very much

<P>from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank

<P>brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--

<P>and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged

<P>to remain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been

<P>more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack

<P>could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a

<P>dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,

<P>and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and

<P>more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out

<P>her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,

<P>or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,

<P>and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,

<P>and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,

<P>demanding more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling

<P>and conditioning, they loud and insolent.&nbsp; By a most fortunate

<P>chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him

<P>to her assistance at this critical moment.&nbsp; The pleasantness

<P>of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his

<P>horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--

<P>and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before

<P>of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had

<P>been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:

<P>he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,

<P>was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.

<P>The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet

<P>was then their own portion.&nbsp; He had left them completely frightened;

<P>and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,

<P>had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits

<P>were quite overcome.&nbsp; It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:

<P>he had thought of no other place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and

<P>of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--

<P>He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays

<P>left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give

<P>assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there

<P>being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,

<P>he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter

<P>for her friend and herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young

<P>woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting

<P>certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.

<P>So Emma thought, at least.&nbsp; Could a linguist, could a grammarian,

<P>could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their

<P>appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling

<P>that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting

<P>to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,

<P>be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such

<P>a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a very extraordinary thing!&nbsp; Nothing of the sort had ever

<P>occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;

<P>no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened

<P>to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very

<P>person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly

<P>was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable

<P>state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.

<P>He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,

<P>she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.&nbsp; It seemed as
if

<P>every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.

<P>It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly

<P>recommending each to the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him,

<P>while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,

<P>her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a

<P>sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's

<P>own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation

<P>at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.

<P>Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled

<P>nor assisted.&nbsp; She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.

<P>No, she had had enough of interference.&nbsp; There could be no harm

<P>in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.&nbsp; It was no more than a wish.

<P>Beyond it she would on no account proceed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge

<P>of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion:

<P>but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.&nbsp; Within
half

<P>an hour it was known all over Highbury.&nbsp; It was the very event

<P>to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all

<P>the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of

<P>frightful news.&nbsp; The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies.

<P>Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,

<P>would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go

<P>beyond the shrubbery again.&nbsp; It was some comfort to him that many

<P>inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours

<P>knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith,

<P>were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure

<P>of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--

<P>which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,

<P>and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.

<P>She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such

<P>a man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not

<P>invent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took

<P>themselves off in a hurry.&nbsp; The young ladies of Highbury might
have

<P>walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole

<P>history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma

<P>and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground,

<P>and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of

<P>Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right

<P>if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.
