<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous

<P>as herself to avoid a meeting.&nbsp; Their intercourse was painful

<P>enough by letter.&nbsp; How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,

<P>without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied

<P>there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in

<P>her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--

<P>It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an

<P>angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;

<P>and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,

<P>without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.

<P>Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.

<P>Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill

<P>health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a

<P>dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet

<P>under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,

<P>Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--

<P>Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was

<P>to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,

<P>it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she

<P>could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by

<P>that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,

<P>which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was

<P>near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,

<P>be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps

<P>an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not

<P>think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,

<P>which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place

<P>in her mind which Harriet had occupied.&nbsp; There was a communication

<P>before her, one which she only could be competent to make--

<P>the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would

<P>have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer

<P>the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.&nbsp; No additional

<P>agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--

<P>and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the

<P>appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,

<P>to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half

<P>an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--

<P>She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of

<P>their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.

<P>It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a

<P>similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with

<P>which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had

<P>not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor

<P>Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,

<P>though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--

<P>The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured

<P>of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--

<P>She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor

<P>Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard

<P>nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"--and a moment

<P>afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly

<P>forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--

<P>Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.

<P>There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every

<P>thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--

<P>She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very

<P>feeling tone,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible

<P>for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being

<P>so entirely without words."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,

<P>if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not

<P>checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly

<P>and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest

<P>shake of the hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.&nbsp; Miss Bates was out,

<P>which accounted for the previous tranquillity.&nbsp; Emma could have

<P>wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience

<P>with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,

<P>she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,

<P>and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;

<P>it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself

<P>acquainted with what was still a secret to other people.

<P>Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;

<P>and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing

<P>to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort

<P>of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently

<P>been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple

<P>and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We can finish this some other time, you know.&nbsp; You and I shall

<P>not want opportunities.&nbsp; And, in fact, you have heard all the

<P>essential already.&nbsp; I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S.
admits

<P>our apology, and is not offended.&nbsp; You see how delightfully

<P>she writes.&nbsp; Oh! she is a sweet creature!&nbsp; You would have
doated

<P>on her, had you gone.--But not a word more.&nbsp; Let us be discreet--

<P>quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--

<P>I forget the poem at this moment:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For when a lady's in the
case,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know all other things
give place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read----mum! a word

<P>to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?&nbsp; But I want

<P>to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--My representation, you see,

<P>has quite appeased her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look

<P>at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I mentioned no names, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as

<P>a minister of state.&nbsp; I managed it extremely well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not doubt.&nbsp; It was a palpable display, repeated on every

<P>possible occasion.&nbsp; When they had all talked a little while in
harmony

<P>of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed
with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is

<P>charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the

<P>highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)

<P>Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--

<P>Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!"--

<P>And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,

<P>"We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have;

<P>not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;

<P>Perry shall have all the credit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,"

<P>she shortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill.

<P>Very pleasant party.&nbsp; But yet I think there was something wanting.

<P>Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon

<P>the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might

<P>be mistaken.&nbsp; However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one

<P>to go again.&nbsp; What say you both to our collecting the same party,

<P>and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--

<P>It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,

<P>not one exception."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted

<P>by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,

<P>from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible

<P>to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--

<P>that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--

<P>How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--

<P>Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--

<P>Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--

<P>such attention to Jane!"--And from her great, her more than commonly

<P>thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed

<P>that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,

<P>from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--

<P>After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,

<P>Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,

<P>that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;

<P>but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.

<P>He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--

<P>That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like

<P>morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning

<P>to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence

<P>or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,

<P>are always wanting his opinion.&nbsp; They seem not able to do any thing

<P>without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than
I.--

<P>I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,

<P>if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I

<P>absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe

<P>I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,

<P>I assure you:&nbsp; yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all."&nbsp;
And putting

<P>up her hand to screen her words from Emma--"A congratulatory visit,

<P>you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself

<P>from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together

<P>in deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mr. Elton

<P>gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.

<P>Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only

<P>of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing

<P>their own way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma.&nbsp; "I am almost certain

<P>that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley

<P>was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day," was the abrupt answer,

<P>which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--

<P>"I do believe," she continued, "this is the most troublesome parish

<P>that ever was.&nbsp; We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your parish there was small," said Jane.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject

<P>talked of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard

<P>you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;

<P>the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true.&nbsp; What a thinking brain

<P>you have!&nbsp; I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should
make,

<P>if we could be shaken together.&nbsp; My liveliness and your solidity

<P>would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,

<P>that some people may not think you perfection already.--But hush!--

<P>not a word, if you please."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,

<P>not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.

<P>The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,

<P>was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton made his appearance.&nbsp; His lady greeted him with some

<P>of her sparkling vivacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an

<P>encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--

<P>But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.

<P>You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--

<P>Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies

<P>a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,

<P>how soon it may be wanted?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.

<P>His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent

<P>object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,

<P>and the walk he had had for nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When I got to Donwell," said he, "Knightley could not be found.

<P>Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,

<P>and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home

<P>till one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Donwell!" cried his wife.--"My dear Mr. E., you have not been

<P>to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley

<P>to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--

<P>I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)

<P>which made it so much the worse.&nbsp; And then not to find him at home!

<P>I assure you I am not at all pleased.&nbsp; And no apology left, no
message

<P>for me.&nbsp; The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being
expected.--

<P>Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.

<P>Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--

<P>Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you

<P>explain it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,

<P>indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife

<P>ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,

<P>of all people in the world!&nbsp; The very last person whom one should
expect

<P>to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,

<P>I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--

<P>and his servants forgot it.&nbsp; Depend upon it, that was the case:

<P>and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,

<P>I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I

<P>would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard

<P>for any consideration.&nbsp; And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds

<P>her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never

<P>sent it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near

<P>the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,

<P>but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.

<P>He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he

<P>could hardly ever get the speech of him.&nbsp; I have nothing to do
with

<P>William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I

<P>should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,

<P>of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk

<P>to no purpose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.

<P>In all probability she was at this very time waited for there;

<P>and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression

<P>towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined

<P>to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;

<P>it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,

<P>to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.

<P>Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been

<P>tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more

<P>openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should

<P>certainly have been impertinent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought

<P>infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her

<P>usual composure--"there would have been no danger.&nbsp; The danger

<P>would have been of my wearying you.&nbsp; You could not have gratified

<P>me more than by expressing an interest--.&nbsp; Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I

<P>have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly

<P>consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good

<P>opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a

<P>degree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say.

<P>I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.

<P>I feel it so very due.&nbsp; But, unfortunately--in short, if your

<P>compassion does not stand my friend--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly,

<P>and taking her hand.&nbsp; "You owe me no apologies; and every body
to

<P>whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,

<P>so delighted even--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--

<P>So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life

<P>of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray say no more.&nbsp; I feel that all the apologies should be on
my side.

<P>Let us forgive each other at once.&nbsp; We must do whatever is to be

<P>done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.

<P>I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--

<P>just as I begin to know you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.

<P>I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma,

<P>smiling--"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The smile was returned as Jane answered,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very right; it has been thought of.&nbsp; And I will own

<P>to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living

<P>with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.&nbsp; There must be

<P>three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,

<P>I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--

<P>Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!--

<P>Good-bye, good-bye."
