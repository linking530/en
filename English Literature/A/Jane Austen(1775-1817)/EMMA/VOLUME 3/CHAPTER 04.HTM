<P>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came

<P>one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after

<P>sitting down and hesitating, thus began:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I

<P>should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,

<P>you know, it will be over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.

<P>There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her,

<P>quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued,

<P>"to have no reserves with you on this subject.&nbsp; As I am happily

<P>quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you

<P>should have the satisfaction of knowing it.&nbsp; I do not want to say

<P>more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way

<P>as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . ."

<P>cried Harriet, warmly.&nbsp; "It seems like madness!&nbsp; I can see
nothing

<P>at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet

<P>him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--

<P>and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do

<P>not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,

<P>as I have done:&nbsp; she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,

<P>but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget

<P>her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,

<P>it will not give me another moment's pang:&nbsp; and to convince you

<P>that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I

<P>ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--

<P>I know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I

<P>will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it

<P>in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.

<P>Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said she, with a conscious
look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have

<P>valued very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most

<P>precious treasures on the top.&nbsp; Her curiosity was greatly excited.

<P>Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.

<P>Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware
box,

<P>which Harriet opened:&nbsp; it was well lined with the softest cotton;

<P>but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now," said Harriet, "you must recollect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed I do not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me!&nbsp; I should not have thought it possible you could forget

<P>what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very

<P>last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I

<P>had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--

<P>I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger

<P>with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--

<P>But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired

<P>me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;

<P>but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept

<P>playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.

<P>And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--

<P>so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then

<P>as a great treat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,

<P>and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.

<P>Remember it?&nbsp; Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving

<P>this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting

<P>the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none

<P>about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in

<P>my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a

<P>continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--

<P>go on--what else?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And had you really some at hand yourself?&nbsp; I am sure I never

<P>suspected it, you did it so naturally."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!"

<P>said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided

<P>between wonder and amusement.&nbsp; And secretly she added to herself,

<P>"Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton

<P>a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!

<P>I never was equal to this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here," resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, "here is

<P>something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable,

<P>because this is what did really once belong to him, which the

<P>court-plaister never did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.&nbsp; It was the
end

<P>of an old pencil,--the part without any lead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This was really his," said Harriet.--"Do not you remember

<P>one morning?--no, I dare say you do not.&nbsp; But one morning--I forget

<P>exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before

<P>that evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;

<P>it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him

<P>something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;

<P>but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he

<P>soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,

<P>and this was left upon the table as good for nothing.&nbsp; But I kept

<P>my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never

<P>parted with it again from that moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.--

<P>Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying
we

<P>liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too.

<P>I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,

<P>was not he?&nbsp; I have an idea he was standing just here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,

<P>but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,

<P>much about where I am now."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, go on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! that's all.&nbsp; I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--

<P>except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,

<P>and I wish you to see me do it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness

<P>in treasuring up these things?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish

<P>I could forget as easily as I can burn them.&nbsp; It was very wrong

<P>of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.

<P>I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have

<P>not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister

<P>might be useful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall be happier to burn it," replied Harriet.&nbsp; "It has

<P>a disagreeable look to me.&nbsp; I must get rid of every thing.--

<P>There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was

<P>already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had

<P>told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a

<P>fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,

<P>and quite undesignedly.&nbsp; Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,

<P>which made the information she received more valuable.

<P>She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet,

<P>whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so"--and thought

<P>no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet

<P>say in a very serious tone, "I shall never marry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a

<P>moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never marry!--This is a new resolution."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is one that I shall never change, however."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed from--

<P>I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.--"Oh! no"--and Emma

<P>could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She then took a longer time for consideration.&nbsp; Should she proceed

<P>no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--

<P>Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;

<P>or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive

<P>Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing

<P>like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent

<P>discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--

<P>She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,

<P>all that she meant to say and know.&nbsp; Plain dealing was always best.

<P>She had previously determined how far she would proceed,

<P>on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,

<P>to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--

<P>She was decided, and thus spoke--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.

<P>Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,

<P>results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,

<P>would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.

<P>Is not it so?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to
suppose--

<P>Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him

<P>at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all

<P>the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,

<P>which are so proper, in me especially."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.&nbsp; The service he rendered

<P>you was enough to warm your heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--

<P>The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--

<P>when I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.

<P>Such a change!&nbsp; In one moment such a change!&nbsp; From perfect
misery

<P>to perfect happiness!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is very natural.&nbsp; It is natural, and it is honourable.--

<P>Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--

<P>But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.

<P>I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.&nbsp; I do not by any

<P>means engage for its being returned.&nbsp; Consider what you are about.

<P>Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can:

<P>at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded

<P>of his liking you.&nbsp; Be observant of him.&nbsp; Let his behaviour
be the

<P>guide of your sensations.&nbsp; I give you this caution now, because
I

<P>shall never speak to you again on the subject.&nbsp; I am determined

<P>against all interference.&nbsp; Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.

<P>Let no name ever pass our lips.&nbsp; We were very wrong before;

<P>we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there

<P>do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;

<P>but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have

<P>been matches of greater disparity.&nbsp; But take care of yourself.

<P>I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,

<P>be assured your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste

<P>which I shall always know how to value."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.

<P>Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing

<P>for her friend.&nbsp; Its tendency would be to raise and refine her
mind--

<P>and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.
