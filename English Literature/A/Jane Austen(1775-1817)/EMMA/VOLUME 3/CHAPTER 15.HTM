<P>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings.&nbsp; She was obliged,

<P>in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do

<P>it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.&nbsp; As soon as she

<P>came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating

<P>to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;

<P>and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,

<P>by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the

<P>very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at

<P>that moment.&nbsp; She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;

<P>and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,

<P>yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,

<P>and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,

<P>and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,

<P>that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,

<P>she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,

<P>she desired him to read it.&nbsp; She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing

<P>it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,

<P>had seen so much to blame in his conduct.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he; "but it seems long.

<P>I will take it home with me at night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But that would not do.&nbsp; Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,

<P>and she must return it by him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would rather be talking to you," he replied; "but as it seems

<P>a matter of justice, it shall be done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I been offered

<P>the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a
few

<P>months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,

<P>with a smile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening:

<P>But it is his way.&nbsp; One man's style must not be the rule of another's.

<P>We will not be severe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will be natural for me," he added shortly afterwards, "to speak
my

<P>opinion aloud as I read.&nbsp; By doing it, I shall feel that I am near
you.

<P>It will not be so great a loss of time:&nbsp; but if you dislike it--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all.&nbsp; I should wish it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He trifles here," said he, "as to the temptation.&nbsp; He knows

<P>he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought

<P>not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'--

<P>he is unjust, however, to his father.&nbsp; Mr. Weston's sanguine

<P>temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;

<P>but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured

<P>to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that he

<P>might have come sooner if he would.&nbsp; You pass it over very handsomely--

<P>but you were perfectly right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--

<P>had you not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole

<P>of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;

<P>a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;

<P>or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,

<P>seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most

<P>dangerous game.&nbsp; Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--

<P>No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his

<P>own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--

<P>Fancying you to have fathomed his secret.&nbsp; Natural enough!--

<P>his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it

<P>in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!

<P>My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the

<P>beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,

<P>which she could not give any sincere explanation of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You had better go on," said she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte!

<P>Ah!&nbsp; That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young

<P>to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much

<P>exceed the pleasure.&nbsp; A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot

<P>comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection

<P>which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did

<P>know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this, he made some progress without any pause.

<P>Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully

<P>was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"--was then his remark.

<P>"You did behave very shamefully.&nbsp; You never wrote a truer line."

<P>And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis

<P>of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct

<P>opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause

<P>to say, "This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,

<P>for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,

<P>and it should have been his first object to prevent her from

<P>suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,

<P>in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.&nbsp; He should have

<P>respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers

<P>were all reasonable.&nbsp; We must look to her one fault, and remember

<P>that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,

<P>to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,

<P>and grew uncomfortable.&nbsp; Her own behaviour had been so very improper!

<P>She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look.

<P>It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without

<P>the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,

<P>instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance

<P>of Box Hill seemed to exist.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,

<P>the Eltons," was his next observation.--"His feelings are natural.--

<P>What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt

<P>the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--

<P>she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of

<P>his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope he does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.

<P>"`Smallridge!'--What does this mean?&nbsp; What is all this?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--

<P>a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and,

<P>by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even

<P>of Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; Only one page more.&nbsp; I shall soon have done.

<P>What a letter the man writes!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, there is feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding

<P>her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her.

<P>`Dearer, much dearer than ever.'&nbsp; I hope he may long continue to
feel

<P>all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,

<P>with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.'

<P>Come, he knows himself there.&nbsp; `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child

<P>of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--

<P>And a fine ending--and there is the letter.&nbsp; The child of good
fortune!

<P>That was your name for him, was it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;

<P>but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better

<P>of him for it.&nbsp; I hope it does him some service with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, certainly it does.&nbsp; He has had great faults, faults of

<P>inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his

<P>opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves:

<P>but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,

<P>and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly

<P>with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,

<P>and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle

<P>that it wants.&nbsp; And now, let me talk to you of something else.

<P>I have another person's interest at present so much at heart,

<P>that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.&nbsp; Ever since
I

<P>left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on

<P>one subject."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,

<P>such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,

<P>how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the

<P>happiness of her father.&nbsp; Emma's answer was ready at the first
word.

<P>"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible

<P>for her.&nbsp; She could never quit him."&nbsp; Part only of this answer,

<P>however, was admitted.&nbsp; The impossibility of her quitting her father,

<P>Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility

<P>of any other change, he could not agree to.&nbsp; He had been thinking

<P>it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce

<P>Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe

<P>it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer

<P>him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,

<P>that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort,

<P>perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse

<P>taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.

<P>But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted

<P>his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;

<P>it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as

<P>her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield

<P>to continue her home, it should be his likewise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own

<P>passing thoughts.&nbsp; Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected
it;

<P>but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.

<P>She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.&nbsp; She felt that,

<P>in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence

<P>of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,

<P>and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,

<P>to be borne with.&nbsp; She promised to think of it, and advised him

<P>to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection

<P>could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.&nbsp; He had

<P>given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;

<P>he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,

<P>to have his thoughts to himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma.&nbsp; "I am

<P>sure William Larkins will not like it.&nbsp; You must get his consent

<P>before you ask mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,

<P>to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view

<P>in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never

<P>struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights

<P>as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.

<P>Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;

<P>and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,

<P>and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent

<P>dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,

<P>which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of

<P>the sister and the aunt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--

<P>the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.

<P>His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,

<P>their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.&nbsp; Such a companion

<P>for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--

<P>Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be

<P>giving increase of melancholy!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every

<P>blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings

<P>of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.

<P>The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,

<P>poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a

<P>distance from.&nbsp; She would be a loser in every way.&nbsp; Emma could
not

<P>deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.

<P>In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;

<P>but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity

<P>that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,

<P>supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.

<P>Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--

<P>not like Mr. Elton.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,

<P>so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be

<P>less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even

<P>of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men

<P>in one year.
