<P>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety;

<P>and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased

<P>to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.

<P>She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.&nbsp; She would

<P>not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match

<P>for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was

<P>convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.

<P>It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--

<P>and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have

<P>his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks

<P>and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--

<P>no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it

<P>would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,

<P>should not have their powers in exercise again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,"

<P>she continued--"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis,

<P>in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see

<P>her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even more

<P>than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.

<P>It will be the only difference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.&nbsp; She will be disagreeable

<P>in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.&nbsp; I am losing

<P>all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.

<P>I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be horrible

<P>ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma laughed, and replied:&nbsp; "But I had the assistance of all

<P>your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.

<P>I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you?--I have no doubt.&nbsp; Nature gave you understanding:--

<P>Miss Taylor gave you principles.&nbsp; You must have done well.

<P>My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.&nbsp; It was

<P>very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--

<P>and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done

<P>in a disagreeable manner.&nbsp; I do not believe I did you any good.

<P>The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest

<P>affection to me.&nbsp; I could not think about you so much without doating

<P>on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,

<P>have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sure you were of use to me," cried Emma.&nbsp; "I was very often

<P>influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.

<P>I am very sure you did me good.&nbsp; And if poor little Anna Weston
is

<P>to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much

<P>for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her

<P>when she is thirteen."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one

<P>of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;

<P>papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which,

<P>you knew, I did not approve.&nbsp; In such cases my interference was
giving

<P>you two bad feelings instead of one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold

<P>my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,

<P>from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.

<P>I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,

<P>about ten years ago.&nbsp; I did it because I thought it would offend
you;

<P>but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And cannot you call me `George' now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'

<P>I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,

<P>by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise," she added presently,

<P>laughing and blushing--"I will promise to call you once by your

<P>Christian name.&nbsp; I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess

<P>where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one

<P>important service which his better sense would have rendered her,

<P>to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all

<P>her womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;

<P>but it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--

<P>Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them.&nbsp; This, on his side,

<P>might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma

<P>was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,

<P>from some appearances, that their friendship were declining.

<P>She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,

<P>they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her

<P>intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,

<P>on Isabella's letters.&nbsp; He might observe that it was so.&nbsp;
The pain

<P>of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little

<P>inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could

<P>be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,

<P>which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to

<P>be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not

<P>appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--

<P>Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet

<P>had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have

<P>escaped her.&nbsp; Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried
on,

<P>by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be

<P>a month at least.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down

<P>in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"John does not even mention your friend," said Mr. Knightley.

<P>"Here is his answer, if you like to see it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.

<P>Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive

<P>to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing

<P>that her friend was unmentioned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"John enters like a brother into my happiness," continued Mr. Knightley,

<P>"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,

<P>likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from

<P>making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather

<P>cool in her praise.&nbsp; But I am not afraid of your seeing what he
writes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He writes like a sensible man," replied Emma, when she had read

<P>the letter.&nbsp; "I honour his sincerity.&nbsp; It is very plain that
he

<P>considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,

<P>but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy

<P>of your affection, as you think me already.&nbsp; Had he said any thing

<P>to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My Emma, he means no such thing.&nbsp; He only means--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"

<P>interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--"much less, perhaps,

<P>than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve

<P>on the subject."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma, my dear Emma--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy your

<P>brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in

<P>the secret, and hear his opinion.&nbsp; Depend upon it, he will be much

<P>farther from doing you justice.&nbsp; He will think all the happiness,

<P>all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit

<P>on mine.&nbsp; I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.--

<P>His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easily convinced

<P>as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,

<P>to be happy together.&nbsp; I am amused by one part of John's letter--

<P>did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take

<P>him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing

<P>something of the kind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having

<P>some thoughts of marrying.&nbsp; He had no idea of me.&nbsp; He seems
perfectly

<P>unprepared for that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into

<P>my feelings.&nbsp; What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious

<P>of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare

<P>him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--

<P>But it was so, I suppose.&nbsp; I dare say there was a difference when
I

<P>was staying with them the other day.&nbsp; I believe I did not play

<P>with the children quite so much as usual.&nbsp; I remember one evening

<P>the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'

<P>reception of it tried.&nbsp; As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently

<P>recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view

<P>that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,

<P>resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--

<P>But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself

<P>to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it

<P>came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must

<P>have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,

<P>and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced

<P>to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.&nbsp; She must not make it a
more

<P>decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.

<P>She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits

<P>she could command, she prepared him first for something strange,

<P>and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation

<P>could be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with

<P>no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--

<P>she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield

<P>would receive the constant addition of that person's company

<P>whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,

<P>best in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried

<P>earnestly to dissuade her from it.&nbsp; She was reminded, more than
once,

<P>of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it

<P>would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of

<P>poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.&nbsp; Emma
hung

<P>about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that

<P>he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages

<P>taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:

<P>but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;

<P>she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but

<P>for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal

<P>the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once

<P>got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--

<P>He would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want

<P>to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,

<P>who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--

<P>Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he

<P>like to have him always on the spot?--Yes.&nbsp; That was all very true.

<P>Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see

<P>him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could

<P>not they go on as they had done?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,

<P>the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--

<P>To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,

<P>whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;

<P>and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--

<P>They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters

<P>of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,

<P>on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most

<P>serviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--

<P>well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations

<P>to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;

<P>and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that

<P>it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself

<P>which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--

<P>in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad

<P>if the marriage did take place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she

<P>said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,

<P>never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;

<P>but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had

<P>no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard

<P>for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;

<P>and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable

<P>a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,

<P>so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed

<P>as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,

<P>and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having

<P>thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men

<P>in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own

<P>home for Hartfield!&nbsp; And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear

<P>with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--

<P>The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always

<P>felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank

<P>and Emma.&nbsp; How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had

<P>been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than

<P>by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject

<P>better than by saying--"Those matters will take care of themselves;

<P>the young people will find a way."&nbsp; But here there was nothing
to be

<P>shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.&nbsp; It was all right,

<P>all open, all equal.&nbsp; No sacrifice on any side worth the name.

<P>It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,

<P>and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections

<P>as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.&nbsp; If any thing

<P>could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would

<P>soon have outgrown its first set of caps.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;

<P>and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes

<P>were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--

<P>He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all

<P>the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;

<P>and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he

<P>had always foreseen it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he.&nbsp; "These matters are

<P>always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.

<P>Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has

<P>any suspicion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on

<P>that point.&nbsp; He told her the news.&nbsp; Was not she like a daughter,

<P>his eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,

<P>it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,

<P>immediately afterwards.&nbsp; It was no more than the principals were

<P>prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known

<P>at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking

<P>of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,

<P>with great sagacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In general, it was a very well approved match.&nbsp; Some might think
him,

<P>and others might think her, the most in luck.&nbsp; One set might

<P>recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield

<P>for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements

<P>among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious

<P>objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,

<P>the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.&nbsp; Mr. Elton

<P>cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped "the

<P>young lady's pride would now be contented;" and supposed "she had

<P>always meant to catch Knightley if she could;" and, on the point

<P>of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, "Rather he than I!"--

<P>But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--"Poor Knightley!

<P>poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;

<P>for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--

<P>How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--

<P>not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all

<P>pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine

<P>with them whenever they asked him!&nbsp; But that would be all over
now.--

<P>Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her.

<P>Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on

<P>every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!&nbsp; But she was not at all sorry

<P>that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,

<P>living together.&nbsp; It would never do.&nbsp; She knew a family near
Maple

<P>Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end

<P>of the first quarter.
