<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease,

<P>Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay

<P>five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."--

<P>He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,

<P>in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,

<P>unheard by her father,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it

<P>be possible.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston wants to see you.&nbsp; She must see
you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is she unwell?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.&nbsp; She would have

<P>ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone,

<P>and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; This moment, if you please.&nbsp; It is impossible
to

<P>refuse what you ask in such a way.&nbsp; But what can be the matter?--

<P>Is she really not ill?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.&nbsp; You will know it

<P>all in time.&nbsp; The most unaccountable business!&nbsp; But hush,
hush!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.

<P>Something really important seemed announced by his looks;

<P>but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,

<P>and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,

<P>she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on

<P>their way at a quick pace for Randalls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now,"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--

<P>"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no,"--he gravely replied.--"Don't ask me.&nbsp; I promised my wife

<P>to leave it all to her.&nbsp; She will break it to you better than I
can.

<P>Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Break it to me," cried Emma, standing still with terror.--

<P>"Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened

<P>in Brunswick Square.&nbsp; I know it has.&nbsp; Tell me, I charge you
tell

<P>me this moment what it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed you are mistaken."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest

<P>friends are now in Brunswick Square.&nbsp; Which of them is it?--

<P>I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, Emma."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,

<P>that it has nothing to do with any of them?&nbsp; Good Heavens!--What
can

<P>be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not.&nbsp; It is
not

<P>in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name

<P>of Knightley."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was wrong," he continued, "in talking of its being broke to you.

<P>I should not have used the expression.&nbsp; In fact, it does not concern
you--

<P>it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,

<P>my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.

<P>I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might

<P>be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.

<P>She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,

<P>and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some

<P>money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable

<P>nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late

<P>event at Richmond had brought forward.&nbsp; Her fancy was very active.

<P>Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--

<P>This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.

<P>It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they proceeded--

<P>speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with

<P>any other view.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,

<P>I assure you.&nbsp; You will not see him.&nbsp; He is half way to Windsor

<P>by this time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Has your son been with you, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more

<P>guarded and demure,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--"Well, my dear,"

<P>said he, as they entered the room--"I have brought her, and now

<P>I hope you will soon be better.&nbsp; I shall leave you together.

<P>There is no use in delay.&nbsp; I shall not be far off, if you want
me."--

<P>And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he

<P>quitted the room,--"I have been as good as my word.&nbsp; She has not
the

<P>least idea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,

<P>that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,

<P>she eagerly said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is it my dear friend?&nbsp; Something of a very unpleasant nature,

<P>I find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.

<P>I have been walking all this way in complete suspense.&nbsp; We both

<P>abhor suspense.&nbsp; Do not let mine continue longer.&nbsp; It will
do you

<P>good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.

<P>"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you

<P>are to hear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are right.&nbsp; It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;"

<P>(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)

<P>"He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.

<P>It is impossible to express our surprize.&nbsp; He came to speak to
his

<P>father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stopped to breathe.&nbsp; Emma thought first of herself, and then

<P>of Harriet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "an engagement--

<P>a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any

<P>body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax

<P>are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!&nbsp; You are not serious?&nbsp; You do not
mean it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,

<P>and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--

<P>"You may well be amazed.&nbsp; But it is even so.&nbsp; There has been
a solemn

<P>engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,

<P>and kept a secret from every body.&nbsp; Not a creature knowing it

<P>but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--

<P>It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,

<P>it is yet almost incredible to myself.&nbsp; I can hardly believe it.--

<P>I thought I knew him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between

<P>two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;

<P>and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,

<P>and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is a

<P>circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I

<P>can at all comprehend it.&nbsp; What!--engaged to her all the winter--

<P>before either of them came to Highbury?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,

<P>Emma, very much.&nbsp; It has hurt his father equally.&nbsp; Some part

<P>of his conduct we cannot excuse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend

<P>not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,

<P>be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,

<P>as you are apprehensive of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance

<P>was as steady as her words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my

<P>present perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther tell you,

<P>that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,

<P>when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be

<P>attached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,

<P>is perhaps the wonder.&nbsp; Fortunately, however, it did cease.

<P>I have really for some time past, for at least these three months,

<P>cared nothing about him.&nbsp; You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.

<P>This is the simple truth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could

<P>find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done

<P>her more good than any thing else in the world could do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she.

<P>"On this point we have been wretched.&nbsp; It was our darling wish
that you

<P>might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--

<P>Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of

<P>grateful wonder to you and myself.&nbsp; But this does not acquit him,

<P>Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.

<P>What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,

<P>and with manners so very disengaged?&nbsp; What right had he to endeavour

<P>to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with

<P>persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged

<P>to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--

<P>How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--

<P>very wrong, very wrong indeed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And how could she bear such behaviour!&nbsp; Composure with a witness!

<P>to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,

<P>before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,

<P>which I can neither comprehend nor respect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said

<P>so expressly.&nbsp; He had not time to enter into much explanation.

<P>He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation

<P>which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--

<P>but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.

<P>The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;

<P>and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the

<P>impropriety of his conduct."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Impropriety!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.

<P>Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how

<P>it has sunk him in my opinion.&nbsp; So unlike what a man should be!--

<P>None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth

<P>and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man

<P>should display in every transaction of his life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been

<P>wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer

<P>for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.--"Mrs. Smallridge, too!

<P>Jane actually on the point of going as governess!&nbsp; What could he

<P>mean by such horrible indelicacy?&nbsp; To suffer her to engage herself--

<P>to suffer her even to think of such a measure!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He knew nothing about it, Emma.&nbsp; On this article I can fully

<P>acquit him.&nbsp; It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated

<P>to him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--

<P>Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.

<P>They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--

<P>and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project

<P>of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it

<P>all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,

<P>put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been

<P>carrying on so long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma began to listen better.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "He told
me

<P>at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which

<P>seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.

<P>Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.&nbsp; It may bring many extenuations.

<P>It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are

<P>not to be understood.&nbsp; Don't let us be severe, don't let us be
in

<P>a hurry to condemn him.&nbsp; Let us have patience.&nbsp; I must love
him;

<P>and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,

<P>I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready

<P>to hope that it may.&nbsp; They must both have suffered a great deal

<P>under such a system of secresy and concealment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"His sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done

<P>him much harm.&nbsp; Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely

<P>a difficulty.&nbsp; Conceive what the events of a week have done

<P>in that family!&nbsp; While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there

<P>could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely

<P>are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is

<P>persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required.

<P>What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--

<P>He gave his consent with very little persuasion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for Harriet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light

<P>this morning.&nbsp; He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,

<P>some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get

<P>back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,

<P>that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--

<P>He was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made

<P>him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen

<P>him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of

<P>finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--

<P>and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on

<P>with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none

<P>of them know of the engagement?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"None; not one.&nbsp; He positively said that it had been known to no

<P>being in the world but their two selves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled

<P>to the idea, and I wish them very happy.&nbsp; But I shall always

<P>think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.&nbsp; What has it been

<P>but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--

<P>To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;

<P>and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,

<P>the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves

<P>all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the

<P>midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting

<P>in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both

<P>to hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each

<P>other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "I am

<P>very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,

<P>which both might not have heard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,

<P>when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True.&nbsp; But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss

<P>Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;

<P>and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,

<P>evidently on the watch.&nbsp; His wife gave him a look which invited

<P>him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma,

<P>let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his

<P>heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.

<P>Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may

<P>be fairly said in her favour.&nbsp; It is not a connexion to gratify;

<P>but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it

<P>may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,

<P>that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness

<P>of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--

<P>and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this

<P>one great deviation from the strict rule of right.&nbsp; And how much

<P>may be said in her situation for even that error!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly.&nbsp; "If a woman can ever

<P>be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation

<P>like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the

<P>world is not their's, nor the world's law.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,

<P>exclaiming,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!

<P>This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,

<P>and exercise my talent of guessing.&nbsp; But you really frightened
me.

<P>I thought you had lost half your property, at least.&nbsp; And here,

<P>instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one

<P>of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,

<P>on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished

<P>young women in England for your daughter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was

<P>as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits

<P>was immediate.&nbsp; His air and voice recovered their usual briskness:

<P>he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered

<P>on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted

<P>time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.

<P>His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,

<P>or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all

<P>over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,

<P>in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,

<P>and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could

<P>possibly have done.
