<P>Time passed on.&nbsp; A few more to-morrows, and the party from London

<P>would be arriving.&nbsp; It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking

<P>of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and

<P>grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts

<P>were put by.&nbsp; After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;

<P>and then, in a graver tone, began with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good or bad?" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know which it ought to be called."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.&nbsp; You are trying

<P>not to smile."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much afraid,

<P>my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which

<P>pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which

<P>we do not think alike."&nbsp; He paused a moment, again smiling,

<P>with his eyes fixed on her face.&nbsp; "Does nothing occur to you?--

<P>Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,

<P>though she knew not what.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he.

<P>"You have, I believe, and know the whole."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.

<P>Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--

<P>and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!"

<P>but her lips were closed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from Robert

<P>Martin himself.&nbsp; He left me not half an hour ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were

<P>the same.&nbsp; But in time they will.&nbsp; Time, you may be sure,
will make

<P>one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,

<P>we need not talk much on the subject."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exerting herself.

<P>"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,

<P>but I cannot believe it.&nbsp; It seems an impossibility!--You cannot
mean

<P>to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.&nbsp; You cannot

<P>mean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.&nbsp; You only mean,

<P>that he intends it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I mean that he has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling

<P>but determined decision, "and been accepted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good God!" she cried.--"Well!"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,

<P>in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the

<P>exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she

<P>must be expressing, she added, "Well, now tell me every thing;

<P>make this intelligible to me.&nbsp; How, where, when?--Let me know it
all.

<P>I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,

<P>I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a very simple story.&nbsp; He went to town on business three
days ago,

<P>and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting

<P>to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,

<P>and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.

<P>They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party

<P>was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.

<P>My friend Robert could not resist.&nbsp; They called for him in their
way;

<P>were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with

<P>them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit

<P>(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;

<P>and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,

<P>as happy even as he is deserving.&nbsp; He came down by yesterday's
coach,

<P>and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report

<P>his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.

<P>This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.

<P>Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--

<P>She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's

<P>language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only

<P>in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed

<P>for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention,

<P>without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their

<P>box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley

<P>and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;

<P>and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith

<P>rather uneasy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.&nbsp; To speak,

<P>she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree

<P>of happiness.&nbsp; She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.

<P>Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,

<P>he added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make

<P>you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.

<P>His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies

<P>your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better

<P>of him as you know him more.&nbsp; His good sense and good principles
would

<P>delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your

<P>friend in better hands.&nbsp; His rank in society I would alter if I
could,

<P>which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me

<P>about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself

<P>not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.&nbsp; I
think

<P>Harriet is doing extremely well.&nbsp; Her connexions may be worse than
his.

<P>In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.

<P>I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.

<P>You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly

<P>unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more

<P>determined against him, much more, than she was before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley;

<P>"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,

<P>not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told

<P>her he loved her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not help laughing as she answered, "Upon my word,

<P>I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,

<P>are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright

<P>accepted him.&nbsp; I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--

<P>Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;

<P>of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,

<P>in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not

<P>Harriet's hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some

<P>famous ox."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and

<P>Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings,

<P>and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently

<P>passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words,

<P>spoken with such emphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to think

<P>of Robert Martin," that she was really expecting the intelligence

<P>to prove, in some measure, premature.&nbsp; It could not be otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; "Do you dare to suppose

<P>me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--

<P>What do you deserve?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put

<P>up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,

<P>direct answer.&nbsp; Are you quite sure that you understand the terms

<P>on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am quite sure," he replied, speaking very distinctly, "that he

<P>told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,

<P>nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you

<P>a proof that it must be so.&nbsp; He asked my opinion as to what he

<P>was now to do.&nbsp; He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he

<P>could apply for information of her relations or friends.&nbsp; Could
I

<P>mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?

<P>I assured him that I could not.&nbsp; Then, he said, he would endeavour

<P>to see her in the course of this day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,

<P>"and most sincerely wish them happy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all

<P>Harriet's good qualities.&nbsp; I have taken some pains for your sake,

<P>and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe

<P>as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.

<P>I have often talked to her a good deal.&nbsp; You must have seen that

<P>I did.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting
me

<P>of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from
all

<P>my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,

<P>with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing

<P>her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--

<P>Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her head.--"Ah! poor Harriet!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little

<P>more praise than she deserved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of

<P>her father.&nbsp; She was not sorry.&nbsp; She wanted to be alone.&nbsp;
Her mind

<P>was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her

<P>to be collected.&nbsp; She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;

<P>and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed

<P>and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put

<P>the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;

<P>and she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations

<P>may be imagined.&nbsp; The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in
the

<P>prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming

<P>too happy for security.--What had she to wish for?&nbsp; Nothing, but
to

<P>grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been

<P>ever so superior to her own.&nbsp; Nothing, but that the lessons

<P>of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;

<P>and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst

<P>of them.&nbsp; She must laugh at such a close!&nbsp; Such an end of
the doleful

<P>disappointment of five weeks back!&nbsp; Such a heart--such a Harriet!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would

<P>be a pleasure.&nbsp; It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,

<P>was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from

<P>Mr. Knightley would soon be over.&nbsp; The disguise, equivocation,

<P>mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.

<P>She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect

<P>confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;

<P>not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;

<P>and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable

<P>persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,

<P>or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--

<P>but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse

<P>received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse

<P>was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "I was just

<P>going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive

<P>this morning.&nbsp; He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been

<P>persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In half a minute they were in the room.&nbsp; Emma was extremely glad

<P>to see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of

<P>embarrassing recollections on each side.&nbsp; They met readily and
smiling,

<P>but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;

<P>and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank

<P>in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,

<P>which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,

<P>and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.

<P>When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby

<P>was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--

<P>or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her

<P>and say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving

<P>message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.&nbsp; I hope time has not made

<P>you less willing to pardon.&nbsp; I hope you do not retract what you

<P>then said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed," cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the least.

<P>I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give

<P>you joy in person."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak

<P>with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.

<P>"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and

<P>Mrs. Weston doat upon her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,

<P>after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named

<P>the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced

<P>in her hearing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme shame."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be.&nbsp; But is
it

<P>possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.&nbsp; Early, I
know,

<P>you had none."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never had the smallest, I assure you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That appears quite wonderful.&nbsp; I was once very near--and I wish
I had--

<P>it would have been better.&nbsp; But though I was always doing wrong
things,

<P>they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--

<P>It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond

<P>of secrecy and told you every thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not now worth a regret," said Emma.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded

<P>to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.

<P>When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,

<P>and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,

<P>I am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--

<P>Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.

<P>Do not you pity me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession

<P>of gay thought, he cried,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! by the bye," then sinking his voice, and looking demure for

<P>the moment--"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?"&nbsp; He paused.--She coloured

<P>and laughed.--"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember

<P>my wish in your favour.&nbsp; Let me return your congratulations.--

<P>I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest

<P>and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;

<P>but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his

<P>own Jane, and his next words were,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--

<P>and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.

<P>It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--

<P>a most distinguishing complexion!&nbsp; So peculiarly the lady in it.--

<P>Just colour enough for beauty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly; "but do
not

<P>I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--

<P>When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could

<P>not help saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,

<P>you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--

<P>I am sure it was a consolation to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?

<P>I was the most miserable wretch!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.&nbsp; I am sure
it

<P>was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking

<P>us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell

<P>you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself

<P>in the same situation.&nbsp; I think there is a little likeness between
us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He bowed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look of

<P>true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny

<P>which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior

<P>to our own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True, true," he answered, warmly.&nbsp; "No, not true on your side.&nbsp;
You can

<P>have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.

<P>Look at her.&nbsp; Is not she an angel in every gesture?&nbsp; Observe
the turn

<P>of her throat.&nbsp; Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--

<P>You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)

<P>that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.&nbsp; They are
to be

<P>new set.&nbsp; I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.

<P>Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very beautiful, indeed," replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,

<P>that he gratefully burst out,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such

<P>excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.

<P>I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an

<P>account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,

<P>from the infant's appearing not quite well.&nbsp; She believed she had

<P>been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half

<P>a minute of sending for Mr. Perry.&nbsp; Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,

<P>but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,

<P>however, the child had been perfectly well again.&nbsp; This was

<P>her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,

<P>and only regretted that she had not done it.&nbsp; "She should always
send

<P>for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,

<P>were it only for a moment.&nbsp; She could not be too soon alarmed,

<P>nor send for Perry too often.&nbsp; It was a pity, perhaps, that he

<P>had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,

<P>very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry

<P>had seen it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank Churchill caught the name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perry!" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss

<P>Fairfax's eye.&nbsp; "My friend Mr. Perry!&nbsp; What are they saying

<P>about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does

<P>he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined

<P>in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she

<P>too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried.&nbsp; "I can never
think

<P>of it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.

<P>I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.

<P>Look at her.&nbsp; Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage

<P>of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--

<P>that the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to

<P>nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile

<P>partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,

<P>low, yet steady voice,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--

<P>They will sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;

<P>but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on

<P>leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two
men,

<P>she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,

<P>and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never

<P>been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.

<P>The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the

<P>animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.
