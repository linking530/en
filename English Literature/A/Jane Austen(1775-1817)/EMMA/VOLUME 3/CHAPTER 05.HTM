<P>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened

<P>upon Hartfield.&nbsp; To Highbury in general it brought no material
change.

<P>The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,

<P>and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax

<P>was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells

<P>from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,

<P>fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,

<P>provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity

<P>in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful

<P>situation against her will.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly

<P>taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike

<P>him more.&nbsp; He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his

<P>pursuit of Emma.&nbsp; That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.

<P>Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints,

<P>his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison;

<P>words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.

<P>But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making
him

<P>over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination

<P>to trifle with Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; He could not understand it; but there

<P>were symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--

<P>symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,

<P>he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,

<P>however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination.

<P>She was not present when the suspicion first arose.&nbsp; He was dining

<P>with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had

<P>seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,

<P>from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.

<P>When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering

<P>what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it

<P>were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Myself creating what I saw,"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something

<P>of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank

<P>Churchill and Jane.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,

<P>to spend his evening at Hartfield.&nbsp; Emma and Harriet were going

<P>to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a

<P>larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their

<P>exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston

<P>and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.

<P>They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it

<P>was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,

<P>pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.&nbsp; The Randalls

<P>party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech

<P>from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it

<P>possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.

<P>The gentlemen spoke of his horse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,

<P>"what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he

<P>ever had any such plan."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, I had it from you.&nbsp; You wrote me word of it three months
ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me! impossible!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed you did.&nbsp; I remember it perfectly.&nbsp; You mentioned
it as

<P>what was certainly to be very soon.&nbsp; Mrs. Perry had told somebody,

<P>and was extremely happy about it.&nbsp; It was owing to her persuasion,

<P>as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal

<P>of harm.&nbsp; You must remember it now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must

<P>have dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith,

<P>you walk as if you were tired.&nbsp; You will not be sorry to find

<P>yourself at home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is this?--What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry

<P>and a carriage?&nbsp; Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?

<P>I am glad he can afford it.&nbsp; You had it from himself, had you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it

<P>from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's

<P>having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,

<P>with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard

<P>a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.&nbsp;
I am

<P>a great dreamer.&nbsp; I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--

<P>and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin

<P>dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have had such

<P>a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you

<P>should be thinking of at Enscombe.&nbsp; Perry's setting up his carriage!

<P>and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--

<P>just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;

<P>only a little premature.&nbsp; What an air of probability sometimes

<P>runs through a dream!&nbsp; And at others, what a heap of absurdities

<P>it is!&nbsp; Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is
in

<P>your thoughts when you are absent.&nbsp; Emma, you are a great dreamer,

<P>I think?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was out of hearing.&nbsp; She had hurried on before her guests

<P>to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach

<P>of Mr. Weston's hint.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain

<P>to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this subject,

<P>there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not

<P>mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes

<P>the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,

<P>I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;

<P>for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles

<P>knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret,

<P>known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.

<P>Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came

<P>to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she

<P>had prevailed.&nbsp; Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us

<P>of it when we got home?&nbsp; I forget where we had been walking to--

<P>very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls.

<P>Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do

<P>not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;

<P>she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not

<P>to go beyond:&nbsp; and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it

<P>to a soul that I know of.&nbsp; At the same time, I will not positively

<P>answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do

<P>sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.&nbsp; I am a talker,

<P>you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing

<P>escape me which I should not.&nbsp; I am not like Jane; I wish I were.

<P>I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world.

<P>Where is she?--Oh! just behind.&nbsp; Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's
coming.--

<P>Extraordinary dream, indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were entering the hall.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded

<P>Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.&nbsp; From Frank Churchill's face,

<P>where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,

<P>he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,

<P>and too busy with her shawl.&nbsp; Mr. Weston had walked in.&nbsp; The
two

<P>other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley

<P>suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--

<P>he seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--

<P>Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no time for farther remark or explanation.&nbsp; The dream
must

<P>be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round

<P>the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,

<P>and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and

<P>persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,

<P>on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.

<P>Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a table

<P>behind him, which he could reach as he sat, "have your nephews taken

<P>away their alphabets--their box of letters?&nbsp; It used to stand here.

<P>Where is it?&nbsp; This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought

<P>to be treated rather as winter than summer.&nbsp; We had great amusement

<P>with those letters one morning.&nbsp; I want to puzzle you again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table

<P>was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much

<P>disposed to employ as their two selves.&nbsp; They were rapidly forming

<P>words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.

<P>The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for

<P>Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,

<P>which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily

<P>occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure

<P>of the "poor little boys," or in fondly pointing out, as he took

<P>up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; She gave

<P>a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.

<P>Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley

<P>so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much

<P>as he could, with as little apparent observation.&nbsp; The word

<P>was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.&nbsp; If meant

<P>to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,

<P>she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,

<P>for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,

<P>and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.

<P>She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.

<P>The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,

<P>there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not

<P>otherwise ostensible.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;

<P>but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.

<P>How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been

<P>so lain asleep!&nbsp; He feared there must be some decided involvement.

<P>Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.

<P>These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.

<P>It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank

<P>Churchill's part.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great

<P>alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions.

<P>He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look

<P>sly and demure.&nbsp; He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found

<P>it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it

<P>proper to appear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for shame!"

<P>He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,

<P>"I will give it to her--shall I?"--and as clearly heard Emma

<P>opposing it with eager laughing warmth.&nbsp; "No, no, you must not;

<P>you shall not, indeed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was done however.&nbsp; This gallant young man, who seemed to love

<P>without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,

<P>directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular

<P>degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley's

<P>excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize

<P>every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was

<P>not long before he saw it to be Dixon.&nbsp; Jane Fairfax's perception

<P>seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal

<P>to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters

<P>so arranged.&nbsp; She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing

<P>herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,

<P>and saying only, "I did not know that proper names were allowed,"

<P>pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked

<P>resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.

<P>Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned

<P>towards her aunt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had not

<P>spoken a word--"I was just going to say the same thing.&nbsp; It is
time

<P>for us to be going indeed.&nbsp; The evening is closing in, and grandmama

<P>will be looking for us.&nbsp; My dear sir, you are too obliging.

<P>We really must wish you good night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt

<P>had preconceived.&nbsp; She was immediately up, and wanting to quit

<P>the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;

<P>and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously

<P>pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.

<P>She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was

<P>looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;

<P>and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full

<P>of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist

<P>his observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--

<P>an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question.

<P>He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to

<P>preserve her.&nbsp; It was his duty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement,

<P>the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?

<P>I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very

<P>entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was extremely confused.&nbsp; She could not endure to give him
the

<P>true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,

<P>she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing;

<P>a mere joke among ourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you

<P>and Mr. Churchill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.&nbsp; She would

<P>rather busy herself about any thing than speak.&nbsp; He sat a little

<P>while in doubt.&nbsp; A variety of evils crossed his mind.&nbsp; Interference--

<P>fruitless interference.&nbsp; Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged
intimacy,

<P>seemed to declare her affection engaged.&nbsp; Yet he would speak.

<P>He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in

<P>an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter

<P>any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do you

<P>think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between

<P>the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?&nbsp; Oh! yes, perfectly.--

<P>Why do you make a doubt of it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,

<P>or that she admired him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never, never!" she cried with a most open eagerness--"Never, for

<P>the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.

<P>And how could it possibly come into your head?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--

<P>certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you amuse me excessively.&nbsp; I am delighted to find that you

<P>can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--

<P>very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will

<P>not do.&nbsp; There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;

<P>and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some

<P>peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--

<P>it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of

<P>nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,

<P>which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or

<P>admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.

<P>That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its

<P>being so on his.&nbsp; I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction

<P>which silenced, Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; She was in gay spirits, and would

<P>have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars

<P>of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows

<P>of a circumstance which highly entertained her:&nbsp; but his gaiety
did

<P>not meet hers.&nbsp; He found he could not be useful, and his feelings

<P>were too much irritated for talking.&nbsp; That he might not be irritated

<P>into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender

<P>habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon

<P>afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness

<P>and solitude of Donwell Abbey.
