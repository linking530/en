<P>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all

<P>the evening.&nbsp; How it might be considered by the rest of the party,

<P>she could not tell.&nbsp; They, in their different homes, and their
different

<P>ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it

<P>was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational

<P>satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,

<P>than any she had ever passed.&nbsp; A whole evening of back-gammon with

<P>her father, was felicity to it.&nbsp; There, indeed, lay real pleasure,

<P>for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four

<P>to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree

<P>of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her

<P>general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.&nbsp; As a daughter,

<P>she hoped she was not without a heart.&nbsp; She hoped no one could

<P>have said to her, "How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--

<P>I must, I will tell you truths while I can."&nbsp; Miss Bates should

<P>never again--no, never!&nbsp; If attention, in future, could do away

<P>the past, she might hope to be forgiven.&nbsp; She had been often remiss,

<P>her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought

<P>than fact; scornful, ungracious.&nbsp; But it should be so no more.

<P>In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the

<P>very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,

<P>of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,

<P>that nothing might prevent her.&nbsp; It was not unlikely, she thought,

<P>that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might

<P>come in while she were paying her visit.&nbsp; She had no objection.

<P>She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly

<P>and truly hers.&nbsp; Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but
she

<P>saw him not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The ladies were all at home."&nbsp; She had never rejoiced at the sound

<P>before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,

<P>with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,

<P>or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.

<P>She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry;

<P>the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased

<P>to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.&nbsp; The aunt and

<P>niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.&nbsp; Jane she had

<P>a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door

<P>had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my dear,

<P>I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are

<P>ill enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she

<P>did not quite understand what was going on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not know;

<P>they tell me she is well.&nbsp; I dare say my daughter will be here
presently,

<P>Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; I hope you find a chair.&nbsp; I wish Hetty had
not gone.

<P>I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where

<P>you like?&nbsp; I am sure she will be here presently."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma seriously hoped she would.&nbsp; She had a moment's fear of Miss

<P>Bates keeping away from her.&nbsp; But Miss Bates soon came--"Very happy

<P>and obliged"--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the

<P>same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.

<P>A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead

<P>the way to a return of old feelings.&nbsp; The touch seemed immediate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--

<P>and are come to give us joy.&nbsp; This does not seem much like joy,

<P>indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be

<P>very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,

<P>and she has a dreadful headach just now, writing all the morning:--

<P>such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,

<P>and Mrs. Dixon.&nbsp; `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'--

<P>for tears were in her eyes perpetually.&nbsp; One cannot wonder,

<P>one cannot wonder.&nbsp; It is a great change; and though she is

<P>amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman

<P>before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,

<P>Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing

<P>her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache

<P>she has.&nbsp; When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel

<P>any blessing quite as it may deserve.&nbsp; She is as low as possible.

<P>To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she

<P>is to have secured such a situation.&nbsp; You will excuse her not

<P>coming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--

<P>I want her to lie down upon the bed.&nbsp; `My dear,' said I, `I shall

<P>say you are laid down upon the bed:'&nbsp; but, however, she is not;

<P>she is walking about the room.&nbsp; But, now that she has written

<P>her letters, she says she shall soon be well.&nbsp; She will be extremely

<P>sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will

<P>excuse her.&nbsp; You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--

<P>but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we

<P>had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did

<P>not know any body was coming.&nbsp; `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I,

<P>`depend upon it.&nbsp; Nobody else would come so early.'&nbsp; `Well,'
said she,

<P>`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'

<P>But then Patty came in, and said it was you.&nbsp; `Oh!' said I,

<P>`it is Miss Woodhouse:&nbsp; I am sure you will like to see her.'--

<P>`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away;

<P>and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry

<P>and ashamed we were.&nbsp; `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must,

<P>and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was most sincerely interested.&nbsp; Her heart had been long growing

<P>kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted

<P>as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing

<P>but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle

<P>sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very

<P>naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,

<P>when she might not bear to see herself.&nbsp; She spoke as she felt,

<P>with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the

<P>circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually

<P>determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage

<P>and comfort as possible.&nbsp; "It must be a severe trial to them all.

<P>She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So very kind! " replied Miss Bates.&nbsp; "But you are always kind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through her

<P>dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have

<P>the charge of her three little girls--delightful children.

<P>Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;

<P>if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's;

<P>but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very

<P>same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.

<P>Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; The most indefatigable, true friend.

<P>She would not take a denial.&nbsp; She would not let Jane say, `No;'
for

<P>when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,

<P>the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,

<P>she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the

<P>reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind

<P>to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing

<P>should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she

<P>told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more

<P>idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,

<P>whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.&nbsp; It is
not

<P>every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,

<P>and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she

<P>would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;

<P>she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all

<P>settled that Jane should go.&nbsp; Quite a surprize to me!&nbsp; I had
not

<P>the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,

<P>that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,

<P>she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word

<P>of it till it was all settled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.&nbsp; It was settled
so,

<P>upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley.

<P>`You must all spend your evening with us,' said she--`I positively must

<P>have you all come.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I

<P>thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let

<P>him off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,

<P>and a very agreeable evening we had.&nbsp; Such kind friends, you know,

<P>Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body

<P>seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.&nbsp; Even pleasure,

<P>you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed

<P>very much to have enjoyed it.&nbsp; However, I shall always think it

<P>a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends

<P>who included me in it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been

<P>making up her mind the whole day?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say she had."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all

<P>her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation

<P>that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, there is every thing

<P>in the world that can make her happy in it.&nbsp; Except the Sucklings

<P>and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,

<P>so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.

<P>Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost

<P>equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little

<P>Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet

<P>children anywhere.&nbsp; Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--

<P>It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--

<P>I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.

<P>Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that

<P>so much could be given to a young person like Jane."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what I

<P>remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount

<P>of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions,

<P>dearly earned."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are so noble in your ideas!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it.

<P>Within a fortnight.&nbsp; Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.&nbsp;
My poor

<P>mother does not know how to bear it.&nbsp; So then, I try to put it
out of

<P>her thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any
more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel

<P>and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself

<P>before their return?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such

<P>a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.

<P>I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying

<P>to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating

<P>me upon it!&nbsp; It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before
tea,

<P>because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,

<P>because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;

<P>something happened before tea, but not that.&nbsp; Mr. Elton was called

<P>out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak

<P>with him.&nbsp; Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was
clerk

<P>to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is

<P>bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--

<P>I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she

<P>gets out at all.&nbsp; And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton

<P>about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,

<P>you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing

<P>of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;

<P>and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler

<P>had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having

<P>been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.

<P>That was what happened before tea.&nbsp; It was after tea that Jane
spoke

<P>to Mrs. Elton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly

<P>new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it

<P>possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars

<P>of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all,

<P>it was of no consequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the

<P>accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge

<P>of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over

<P>from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--

<P>which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;

<P>and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,

<P>upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only

<P>wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;

<P>but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,

<P>without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,

<P>Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the

<P>ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,

<P>and driving very steady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,

<P>and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject

<P>which already engaged her mind.&nbsp; The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's

<P>importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was

<P>every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference

<P>of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,

<P>till roused by Miss Bates's saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.&nbsp; What is
to become

<P>of that?--Very true.&nbsp; Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--

<P>`You must go,' said she.&nbsp; `You and I must part.&nbsp; You will
have no

<P>business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroom

<P>till Colonel Campbell comes back.&nbsp; I shall talk about it to him;

<P>he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--

<P>And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his

<P>present or his daughter's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance

<P>of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,

<P>that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been

<P>long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could

<P>venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.
