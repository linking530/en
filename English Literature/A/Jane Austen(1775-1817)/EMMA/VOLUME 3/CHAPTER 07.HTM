<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward

<P>circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,

<P>were in favour of a pleasant party.&nbsp; Mr. Weston directed the whole,

<P>officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every

<P>body was in good time.&nbsp; Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates

<P>and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.

<P>Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; Nothing was wanting

<P>but to be happy when they got there.&nbsp; Seven miles were travelled

<P>in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration

<P>on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there

<P>was deficiency.&nbsp; There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want
of union,

<P>which could not be got over.&nbsp; They separated too much into parties.

<P>The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss

<P>Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.

<P>And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.&nbsp;
It seemed

<P>at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,

<P>and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours

<P>that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,

<P>between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any

<P>cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At first it was downright dulness to Emma.&nbsp; She had never seen
Frank

<P>Churchill so silent and stupid.&nbsp; He said nothing worth hearing--

<P>looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without

<P>knowing what she said.&nbsp; While he was so dull, it was no wonder
that

<P>Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,

<P>for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.

<P>Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.

<P>To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he

<P>cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,

<P>was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,

<P>the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first

<P>and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,

<P>in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most

<P>people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English

<P>word but flirtation could very well describe.&nbsp; "Mr. Frank Churchill

<P>and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively."&nbsp; They were laying

<P>themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off

<P>in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.

<P>Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;

<P>it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected.

<P>She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him

<P>for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,

<P>admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning

<P>back her heart.&nbsp; She still intended him for her friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to come to-day!--

<P>If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the

<P>happiness of this party.&nbsp; I had quite determined to go away again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,

<P>except that you were too late for the best strawberries.

<P>I was a kinder friend than you deserved.&nbsp; But you were humble.

<P>You begged hard to be commanded to come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't say I was cross.&nbsp; I was fatigued.&nbsp; The heat overcame
me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is hotter to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not to my feelings.&nbsp; I am perfectly comfortable to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are comfortable because you are under command."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your command?--Yes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,

<P>somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your

<P>own management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot

<P>be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your

<P>own command rather than mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It comes to the same thing.&nbsp; I can have no self-command without

<P>a motive.&nbsp; You order me, whether you speak or not.&nbsp; And you
can

<P>be always with me.&nbsp; You are always with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dating from three o'clock yesterday.&nbsp; My perpetual influence

<P>could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much

<P>out of humour before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Three o'clock yesterday!&nbsp; That is your date.&nbsp; I thought I
had seen

<P>you first in February."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.&nbsp; But (lowering her voice)--

<P>nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be

<P>talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with lively impudence.

<P>"I saw you first in February.&nbsp; Let every body on the Hill hear
me if

<P>they can.&nbsp; Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking

<P>on the other.&nbsp; I saw you first in February."&nbsp; And then whispering--

<P>"Our companions are excessively stupid.&nbsp; What shall we do to rouse
them?

<P>Any nonsense will serve.&nbsp; They shall talk.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen,

<P>I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)

<P>to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great
deal;

<P>Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding;

<P>Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are

<P>all thinking of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, no"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--

<P>"Upon no account in the world.&nbsp; It is the very last thing I

<P>would stand the brunt of just now.&nbsp; Let me hear any thing rather

<P>than what you are all thinking of.&nbsp; I will not say quite all.

<P>There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)

<P>whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a sort of thing," cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,

<P>"which I should not have thought myself privileged to

<P>inquire into.&nbsp; Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party--

<P>I never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married
women--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,

<P>in reply,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true, my love, very true.&nbsp; Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard
of--

<P>but some ladies say any thing.&nbsp; Better pass it off as a joke.

<P>Every body knows what is due to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most

<P>of them affronted.&nbsp; I will attack them with more address.

<P>Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she

<P>waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,

<P>and only requires something very entertaining from each of you,

<P>in a general way.&nbsp; Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who,
she

<P>is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only

<P>demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose

<P>or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--

<P>or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily

<P>at them all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be uneasy.

<P>`Three things very dull indeed.'&nbsp; That will just do for me, you
know.

<P>I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open

<P>my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured

<P>dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not resist.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty.&nbsp; Pardon me--but you

<P>will be limited as to number--only three at once."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not

<P>immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could

<P>not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!--well--to be sure.&nbsp; Yes, I see what she means, (turning to

<P>Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.&nbsp; I must make

<P>myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing

<P>to an old friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like your plan," cried Mr. Weston.&nbsp; "Agreed, agreed.&nbsp; I
will do

<P>my best.&nbsp; I am making a conundrum.&nbsp; How will a conundrum reckon?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low," answered his son;--"but we shall

<P>be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no," said Emma, "it will not reckon low.&nbsp; A conundrum of

<P>Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour.&nbsp; Come, sir,

<P>pray let me hear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I doubt its being very clever myself," said Mr. Weston.

<P>"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters

<P>of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What two letters!--express perfection!&nbsp; I am sure I do not know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! you will never guess.&nbsp; You, (to Emma), I am certain, will

<P>never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Understanding and gratification came together.&nbsp; It might be a very

<P>indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh

<P>at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem

<P>to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid

<P>about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston

<P>has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every

<P>body else.&nbsp; Perfection should not have come quite so soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused," said Mrs. Elton;

<P>"I really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.

<P>I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not

<P>at all pleased with.&nbsp; I knew who it came from.&nbsp; An abominable
puppy!--

<P>You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things

<P>are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;

<P>but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring

<P>about the country in summer.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.

<P>I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service.

<P>I do not pretend to be a wit.&nbsp; I have a great deal of vivacity

<P>in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak

<P>and when to hold my tongue.&nbsp; Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.

<P>Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.&nbsp; We have nothing clever
to say--

<P>not one of us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, pray pass me," added her husband, with a sort of

<P>sneering consciousness; "I have nothing to say that can entertain

<P>Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.&nbsp; An old married man--

<P>quite good for nothing.&nbsp; Shall we walk, Augusta?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"With all my heart.&nbsp; I am really tired of exploring so long

<P>on one spot.&nbsp; Come, Jane, take my other arm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.

<P>"Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out

<P>of hearing:--"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying
as

<P>they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They
only

<P>knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!&nbsp; Peculiarly lucky!--

<P>for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,

<P>or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be

<P>no knowledge.&nbsp; It is only by seeing women in their own homes,

<P>among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form

<P>any just judgment.&nbsp; Short of that, it is all guess and luck--

<P>and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself

<P>on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her

<P>own confederates, spoke now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such things do occur, undoubtedly."--She was stopped by a cough.

<P>Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were speaking," said he, gravely.&nbsp; She recovered her voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances

<P>do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them

<P>to be very frequent.&nbsp; A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--

<P>but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.&nbsp; I would

<P>be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,

<P>(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)

<P>who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,

<P>an oppression for ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon

<P>afterwards said, in a lively tone,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever

<P>I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.&nbsp; Will you?

<P>(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I

<P>should like any body fixed on by you.&nbsp; You provide for the family,

<P>you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.

<P>I am in no hurry.&nbsp; Adopt her, educate her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And make her like myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By all means, if you can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well.&nbsp; I undertake the commission.&nbsp; You shall have a
charming wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes.&nbsp; I care for nothing
else.

<P>I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return,

<P>I shall come to you for my wife.&nbsp; Remember."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was in no danger of forgetting.&nbsp; It was a commission to touch
every

<P>favourite feeling.&nbsp; Would not Harriet be the very creature described?

<P>Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.

<P>He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;

<P>who could say?&nbsp; Referring the education to her seemed to imply
it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs. Elton?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you please, my dear.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; I am quite ready.

<P>I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.

<P>We shall soon overtake her.&nbsp; There she is--no, that's somebody
else.

<P>That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--

<P>Well, I declare--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley.

<P>Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young

<P>man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.&nbsp; Even Emma
grew

<P>tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather

<P>walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,

<P>and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful

<P>views beneath her.&nbsp; The appearance of the servants looking out

<P>for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;

<P>and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,

<P>and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first,

<P>were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was

<P>to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.

<P>Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,

<P>she hoped never to be betrayed into again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.

<P>He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:

<P>a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still

<P>use it.&nbsp; I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.

<P>How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?&nbsp; How could you be
so

<P>insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--

<P>Emma, I had not thought it possible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped
it.

<P>It was not so very bad.&nbsp; I dare say she did not understand me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I assure you she did.&nbsp; She felt your full meaning.&nbsp; She has
talked

<P>of it since.&nbsp; I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--

<P>with what candour and generosity.&nbsp; I wish you could have heard
her

<P>honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,

<P>as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,

<P>when her society must be so irksome."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in the world:

<P>but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are

<P>most unfortunately blended in her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are blended," said he, "I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,

<P>I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous

<P>over the good.&nbsp; Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every

<P>harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you

<P>for any liberties of manner.&nbsp; Were she your equal in situation--

<P>but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.&nbsp; She is
poor;

<P>she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live

<P>to old age, must probably sink more.&nbsp; Her situation should secure

<P>your compassion.&nbsp; It was badly done, indeed!&nbsp; You, whom she
had known

<P>from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her

<P>notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,

<P>and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before

<P>her niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly some,)

<P>would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.--This is not

<P>pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;

<P>but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;

<P>satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,

<P>and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice

<P>than you can do now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;

<P>it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.

<P>He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,

<P>and her tongue motionless.&nbsp; They were combined only of anger

<P>against herself, mortification, and deep concern.&nbsp; She had not

<P>been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back

<P>for a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken

<P>no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,

<P>she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;

<P>but it was just too late.&nbsp; He had turned away, and the horses were

<P>in motion.&nbsp; She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,

<P>with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,

<P>and every thing left far behind.&nbsp; She was vexed beyond what could

<P>have been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal.

<P>Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance

<P>in her life.&nbsp; She was most forcibly struck.&nbsp; The truth of
this

<P>representation there was no denying.&nbsp; She felt it at her heart.

<P>How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!&nbsp; How
could

<P>she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!

<P>And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,

<P>of concurrence, of common kindness!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Time did not compose her.&nbsp; As she reflected more, she seemed

<P>but to feel it more.&nbsp; She never had been so depressed.&nbsp; Happily
it

<P>was not necessary to speak.&nbsp; There was only Harriet, who seemed
not

<P>in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma

<P>felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,

<P>without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.
