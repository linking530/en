<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The weather continued much the same all the following morning;

<P>and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to

<P>reign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind

<P>changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;

<P>the sun appeared; it was summer again.&nbsp; With all the eagerness

<P>which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors

<P>as soon as possible.&nbsp; Never had the exquisite sight, smell,

<P>sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,

<P>been more attractive to her.&nbsp; She longed for the serenity they
might

<P>gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner,

<P>with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill

<P>hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,

<P>and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she

<P>saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming

<P>towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned

<P>from London.&nbsp; She had been thinking of him the moment before,

<P>as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for

<P>the quickest arrangement of mind.&nbsp; She must be collected and calm.

<P>In half a minute they were together.&nbsp; The "How d'ye do's" were
quiet

<P>and constrained on each side.&nbsp; She asked after their mutual friends;

<P>they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.

<P>He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,

<P>she found.&nbsp; "He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he

<P>was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors."--She thought

<P>he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible

<P>cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been

<P>communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner

<P>in which they had been received.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They walked together.&nbsp; He was silent.&nbsp; She thought he was
often

<P>looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it

<P>suited her to give.&nbsp; And this belief produced another dread.

<P>Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;

<P>he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,

<P>could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.

<P>He must do it all himself.&nbsp; Yet she could not bear this silence.

<P>With him it was most unnatural.&nbsp; She considered--resolved--and,
trying

<P>to smile, began--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather

<P>surprize you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have I?" said he quietly, and looking at her; "of what nature?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,

<P>he replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard

<P>that already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks

<P>towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he

<P>might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,

<P>and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little

<P>more composure,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have

<P>had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give

<P>me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking

<P>voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious

<P>of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm

<P>drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him

<P>thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own

<P>excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know

<P>you will not allow yourself--."&nbsp; Her arm was pressed again,

<P>as he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, "The feelings

<P>of the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!"--

<P>And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon

<P>be gone.&nbsp; They will soon be in Yorkshire.&nbsp; I am sorry for
her.

<P>She deserves a better fate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the

<P>flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--

<P>I am not in want of that sort of compassion.&nbsp; My blindness to what

<P>was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always

<P>be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many

<P>things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I

<P>have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"--

<P>but checking himself--"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am

<P>pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,

<P>indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes

<P>the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your

<P>affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,

<P>from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--

<P>I could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference

<P>which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name

<P>of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--

<P>Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--

<P>"I am in a very extraordinary situation.&nbsp; I cannot let you continue
in

<P>your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,

<P>I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have

<P>been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might

<P>be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--

<P>But I never have."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He listened in perfect silence.&nbsp; She wished him to speak, but he

<P>would not.&nbsp; She supposed she must say more before she were entitled

<P>to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower

<P>herself in his opinion.&nbsp; She went on, however.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted

<P>by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--

<P>An old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened

<P>to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable

<P>in one who sets up as I do for Understanding.&nbsp; Many circumstances

<P>assisted the temptation.&nbsp; He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was

<P>continually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,

<P>for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,

<P>they all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I

<P>allowed his attentions.&nbsp; Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--

<P>I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them

<P>a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.

<P>He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.&nbsp; I have never
been

<P>attached to him.&nbsp; And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.

<P>He never wished to attach me.&nbsp; It was merely a blind to conceal

<P>his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind

<P>all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually

<P>blinded than myself--except that I was not blinded--that it was my

<P>good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her

<P>conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far

<P>as she could judge, deep in thought.&nbsp; At last, and tolerably

<P>in his usual tone, he said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,

<P>however, that I may have underrated him.&nbsp; My acquaintance with

<P>him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated

<P>him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has

<P>a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,

<P>whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,

<P>I shall certainly wish him well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no doubt of their being happy together," said Emma;

<P>"I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.

<P>"So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man

<P>chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.&nbsp; At three-and-twenty

<P>to have drawn such a prize!&nbsp; What years of felicity that man,

<P>in all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of

<P>such a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character

<P>vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--

<P>equality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the

<P>habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--

<P>and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,

<P>such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the

<P>only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman

<P>a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,

<P>where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest

<P>of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.

<P>Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman

<P>at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her

<P>by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round

<P>the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found

<P>her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has

<P>only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--

<P>He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--

<P>He is a fortunate man indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You speak as if you envied him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I do envy him, Emma.&nbsp; In one respect he is the object of my
envy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could say no more.&nbsp; They seemed to be within half a sentence

<P>of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,

<P>if possible.&nbsp; She made her plan; she would speak of something

<P>totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she

<P>only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,

<P>by saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,

<P>I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but I cannot be wise.

<P>Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it

<P>unsaid the next moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried.

<P>"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not

<P>another syllable followed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not bear to give him pain.&nbsp; He was wishing to confide
in her--

<P>perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.

<P>She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;

<P>she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him

<P>his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,

<P>which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind

<P>as his.--They had reached the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are going in, I suppose?" said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No,"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner

<P>in which he still spoke--"I should like to take another turn.

<P>Mr. Perry is not gone."&nbsp; And, after proceeding a few steps, she
added--

<P>"I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,

<P>gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me

<P>as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have

<P>in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will

<P>hear whatever you like.&nbsp; I will tell you exactly what I think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As a friend!"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--"Emma, that I fear is

<P>a word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--

<P>I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--

<P>Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you

<P>as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression

<P>of his eyes overpowered her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest Emma," said he, "for dearest you will always be,

<P>whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest,

<P>most beloved Emma--tell me at once.&nbsp; Say `No,' if it is to be said."--

<P>She could really say nothing.--"You are silent," he cried,

<P>with great animation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.

<P>The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps

<P>the most prominent feeling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot make speeches, Emma:"&nbsp; he soon resumed; and in a tone

<P>of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was

<P>tolerably convincing.--"If I loved you less, I might be able

<P>to talk about it more.&nbsp; But you know what I am.--You hear nothing

<P>but truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you

<P>have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--

<P>Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as

<P>you have borne with them.&nbsp; The manner, perhaps, may have as little

<P>to recommend them.&nbsp; God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--

<P>But you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--

<P>and will return them if you can.&nbsp; At present, I ask only to hear,

<P>once to hear your voice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful

<P>velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--

<P>to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that

<P>Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,

<P>as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;

<P>that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying

<P>relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her

<P>own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,

<P>her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement

<P>from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,

<P>with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to

<P>rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve

<P>that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could

<P>now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment

<P>which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection

<P>from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--

<P>or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him

<P>at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he

<P>could not marry them both, Emma had it not.&nbsp; She felt for Harriet,

<P>with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,

<P>opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.

<P>She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to

<P>her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,

<P>and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such

<P>alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.&nbsp; Her way was clear,

<P>though not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--

<P>What did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.&nbsp; A lady always
does.--

<P>She said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him

<P>to say more himself.&nbsp; He had despaired at one period; he had received

<P>such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed

<P>every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had

<P>perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,

<P>her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,

<P>might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;

<P>but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no

<P>farther explanation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;

<P>seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,

<P>or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct

<P>is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--

<P>Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than

<P>she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.

<P>He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.

<P>He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's

<P>engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,

<P>if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest

<P>had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,

<P>on his feelings.&nbsp; The delightful assurance of her total indifference

<P>towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged

<P>from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain

<P>her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,

<P>in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be

<P>told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior

<P>hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--

<P>The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,

<P>if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed

<P>from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like

<P>perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the

<P>same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each

<P>the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,

<P>there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,

<P>or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love

<P>with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,

<P>one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.

<P>It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from

<P>the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.

<P>He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,

<P>encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--

<P>But he had gone to a wrong place.&nbsp; There was too much domestic

<P>happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;

<P>Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking

<P>inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,

<P>for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had

<P>stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's

<P>post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the

<P>gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,

<P>having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,

<P>was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,

<P>that he could stay no longer.&nbsp; He had ridden home through the rain;

<P>and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest

<P>and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,

<P>bore the discovery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--

<P>He heard her declare that she had never loved him.&nbsp; Frank Churchill's

<P>character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,

<P>when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought

<P>of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort

<P>of fellow.
