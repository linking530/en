<P>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known

<P>how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley,

<P>first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,

<P>and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;

<P>and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly

<P>important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;

<P>for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been

<P>only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she

<P>had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.

<P>She had herself been first with him for many years past.

<P>She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse,

<P>slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of

<P>half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not

<P>acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,

<P>from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind,

<P>he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour

<P>to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no

<P>other creature had at all shared.&nbsp; In spite of all her faults,

<P>she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?--

<P>When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,

<P>presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them.

<P>Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,

<P>exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; She could not.

<P>She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment

<P>to her.&nbsp; She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--

<P>How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!&nbsp; How directly,

<P>how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too

<P>strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from

<P>any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.--

<P>She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could

<P>have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question;

<P>but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,)

<P>that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his

<P>regard for her.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence

<P>nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.

<P>Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,

<P>she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue

<P>the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley

<P>to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their

<P>precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace

<P>would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.

<P>It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with

<P>what she felt for him.&nbsp; Nothing should separate her from her father.

<P>She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;

<P>and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might
at

<P>least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should

<P>see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly

<P>as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching,

<P>she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.--

<P>He was expected back every day.&nbsp; The power of observation would
be

<P>soon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in

<P>one course.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.--

<P>It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good,

<P>to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced,

<P>as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing

<P>Harriet's confidence.&nbsp; To talk would be only to irritate.--She
wrote

<P>to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not,

<P>at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction,

<P>that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better

<P>be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before

<P>they met again, except in the company of others--she objected only

<P>to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten

<P>the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved,

<P>and was grateful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's

<P>thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,

<P>sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had

<P>been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her

<P>way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself,

<P>to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his

<P>share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having

<P>then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned

<P>with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,

<P>than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all

<P>the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while

<P>her friend related.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit

<P>in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had

<P>wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write

<P>to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till

<P>a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled

<P>to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing,

<P>she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--

<P>but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious

<P>to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not

<P>conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,

<P>that it would be of any consequence; for "such things," he observed,

<P>"always got about."&nbsp; Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had

<P>very good reason for saying so.&nbsp; They had gone, in short--and very

<P>great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.

<P>She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action

<P>had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.&nbsp; The
quiet,

<P>heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight

<P>of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,

<P>had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.&nbsp; They were

<P>both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested

<P>in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,

<P>and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work

<P>for them.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea

<P>for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and

<P>declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the

<P>course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,

<P>overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse

<P>on the important subject.&nbsp; Apologies for her seemingly ungracious

<P>silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the

<P>gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,

<P>must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,

<P>they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state

<P>of the engagement.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation

<P>must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own

<P>mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased

<P>with all that she had said on the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment

<P>of so many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic.

<P>This was one of her expressions.&nbsp; `I will not say, that since I

<P>entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I

<P>can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--

<P>and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation

<P>that I felt at my heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor girl!" said Emma.&nbsp; "She thinks herself wrong, then, for having

<P>consented to a private engagement?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wrong!&nbsp; No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed

<P>to blame herself.&nbsp; `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state

<P>of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.&nbsp; But after all the

<P>punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.

<P>Pain is no expiation.&nbsp; I never can be blameless.&nbsp; I have been
acting

<P>contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every

<P>thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my

<P>conscience tells me ought not to be.'&nbsp; `Do not imagine, madam,'

<P>she continued, `that I was taught wrong.&nbsp; Do not let any reflection

<P>fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought

<P>me up.&nbsp; The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,

<P>with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,

<P>I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor girl!" said Emma again.&nbsp; "She loves him then excessively,

<P>I suppose.&nbsp; It must have been from attachment only, that she could

<P>be led to form the engagement.&nbsp; Her affection must have overpowered

<P>her judgment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have

<P>contributed to make her unhappy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.&nbsp; But she

<P>probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding

<P>to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.

<P>One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,"

<P>she said, "was that of making her unreasonable.&nbsp; The consciousness

<P>of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,

<P>and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--

<P>that had been--hard for him to bear.&nbsp; `I did not make the allowances,'

<P>said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--

<P>his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness

<P>of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,

<P>have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'

<P>She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you

<P>had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me

<P>how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,

<P>to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and

<P>every endeavour to do her good.&nbsp; She was sensible that you had
never

<P>received any proper acknowledgment from herself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I did not know her to be happy now," said Emma, seriously,

<P>"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous

<P>conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!

<P>Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil

<P>and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,

<P>and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.

<P>You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.

<P>They shew her to the greatest advantage.&nbsp; I am sure she is very
good--

<P>I hope she will be very happy.&nbsp; It is fit that the fortune

<P>should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.

<P>She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,

<P>she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.

<P>She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--

<P>but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone

<P>to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;

<P>and when Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter

<P>we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,"

<P>she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged

<P>to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it

<P>was which they were so anxious for.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you well, my Emma?" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! perfectly.&nbsp; I am always well, you know.&nbsp; Be sure to give
me

<P>intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for

<P>unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,

<P>and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; She bitterly

<P>regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed

<P>for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,

<P>the cause.&nbsp; Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying

<P>that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she

<P>tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;

<P>had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;

<P>she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain

<P>which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,

<P>had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received

<P>with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that

<P>they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been

<P>admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--

<P>which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,

<P>and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable

<P>suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had

<P>not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so

<P>unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made

<P>a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings,

<P>by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's.&nbsp; Of all the
sources

<P>of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,

<P>she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.

<P>She must have been a perpetual enemy.&nbsp; They never could have been

<P>all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace

<P>in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been

<P>the agony of a mind that would bear no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.

<P>The weather added what it could of gloom.&nbsp; A cold stormy rain set
in,

<P>and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the

<P>wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made

<P>such cruel sights the longer visible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably

<P>comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side,

<P>and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.

<P>It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening

<P>of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked

<P>in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.

<P>Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those

<P>sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.&nbsp; The picture which

<P>she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,

<P>had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures

<P>had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would

<P>experience no similar contradiction.&nbsp; The prospect before her now,

<P>was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--

<P>that might not be even partially brightened.&nbsp; If all took place

<P>that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must

<P>be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the

<P>spirits only of ruined happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer

<P>than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied

<P>by it.&nbsp; They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,

<P>her husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;

<P>and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease

<P>to belong to Highbury.&nbsp; They would be married, and settled either

<P>at or near Enscombe.&nbsp; All that were good would be withdrawn; and
if

<P>to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would

<P>remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?

<P>Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--

<P>No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change

<P>his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured?&nbsp; And if he
were

<P>to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought

<P>of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted;

<P>if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,

<P>the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;

<P>what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never
far

<P>distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain

<P>from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room

<P>for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation

<P>or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own

<P>better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and

<P>gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life

<P>to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted

<P>with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.
