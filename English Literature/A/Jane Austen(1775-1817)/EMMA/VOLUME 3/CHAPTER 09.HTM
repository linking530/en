<P>Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;

<P>but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her.

<P>Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were

<P>sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a

<P>manner decidedly graver than usual, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,

<P>and therefore must now be gone directly.&nbsp; I am going to London,

<P>to spend a few days with John and Isabella.&nbsp; Have you any thing
to

<P>send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing at all.&nbsp; But is not this a sudden scheme?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.

<P>Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be

<P>friends again.&nbsp; While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--

<P>her father began his inquiries.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you

<P>find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must

<P>have been very much obliged to you for coming.&nbsp; Dear Emma has been

<P>to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before.

<P>She is always so attentive to them!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,

<P>and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--

<P>It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,

<P>as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had

<P>passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--

<P>He looked at her with a glow of regard.&nbsp; She was warmly gratified--

<P>and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of

<P>more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--

<P>whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--

<P>she might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,

<P>pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--

<P>when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should
feel

<P>such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,

<P>she could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,

<P>if he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;

<P>and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,

<P>or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--

<P>It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--

<P>She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.

<P>It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--

<P>gone in a moment.&nbsp; He always moved with the alertness of a mind
which

<P>could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden

<P>than usual in his disappearance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished

<P>she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great

<P>pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--

<P>Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,

<P>for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have

<P>happened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,

<P>would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;

<P>she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,

<P>and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she

<P>had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them

<P>half an hour, she found.&nbsp; It was a pity that she had not come

<P>back earlier!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness

<P>of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly;

<P>and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;

<P>Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence

<P>on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--

<P>interested, without disturbing him.&nbsp; He had long made up his mind
to Jane

<P>Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,

<P>but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so

<P>comfortably settled.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,

<P>and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought

<P>to be.&nbsp; I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health

<P>will be taken good care of.&nbsp; It ought to be a first object,

<P>as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.&nbsp; You know,

<P>my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor

<P>was to us.&nbsp; And I hope she will be better off in one respect,

<P>and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every

<P>thing else into the background.&nbsp; An express arrived at Randalls

<P>to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!&nbsp; Though her nephew

<P>had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,

<P>she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return.

<P>A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded

<P>by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle.

<P>The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was felt as such things must be felt.&nbsp; Every body had a

<P>degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,

<P>solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,

<P>curiosity to know where she would be buried.&nbsp; Goldsmith tells us,

<P>that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do

<P>but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally

<P>to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,

<P>after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of

<P>with compassionate allowances.&nbsp; In one point she was fully justified.

<P>She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.&nbsp; The event

<P>acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness

<P>of imaginary complaints.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:

<P>more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try

<P>the temper.&nbsp; It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,

<P>what would Mr. Churchill do without her?&nbsp; Mr. Churchill's loss

<P>would be dreadful indeed.&nbsp; Mr. Churchill would never get over it."--

<P>Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,

<P>"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his

<P>mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing

<P>and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,

<P>true and steady.&nbsp; How it would affect Frank was among the earliest

<P>thoughts of both.&nbsp; It was also a very early speculation with Emma.

<P>The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind

<P>glanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested

<P>with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,

<P>how benefited, how freed.&nbsp; She saw in a moment all the possible
good.

<P>Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter.

<P>Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;

<P>an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.

<P>All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form

<P>the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel

<P>no certainty of its being already formed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.

<P>What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.&nbsp;
Emma was

<P>gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,

<P>and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.

<P>They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating

<P>all that was immediately important of their state and plans.

<P>Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their

<P>first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,

<P>was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom

<P>Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.

<P>At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes

<P>for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,

<P>whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose

<P>engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished

<P>to shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.

<P>She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;

<P>and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now

<P>the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of

<P>regard or sympathy.&nbsp; She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to
shew

<P>a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration.

<P>She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield.

<P>A note was written to urge it.&nbsp; The invitation was refused, and
by

<P>a verbal message.&nbsp; "Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;"

<P>and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,

<P>it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,

<P>though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering

<P>under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made

<P>him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the

<P>time proposed.&nbsp; Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--

<P>appetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely

<P>alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,

<P>which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was

<P>uneasy about her.&nbsp; He thought she had undertaken more than she

<P>was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would

<P>not own it.&nbsp; Her spirits seemed overcome.&nbsp; Her present home,

<P>he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--

<P>confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--

<P>and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge

<P>to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.

<P>Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,

<P>only too great.&nbsp; He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived
more

<P>evil than good from them.&nbsp; Emma listened with the warmest concern;

<P>grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover

<P>some way of being useful.&nbsp; To take her--be it only an hour

<P>or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,

<P>and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,

<P>might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,

<P>in the most feeling language she could command, that she would

<P>call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--

<P>mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour

<P>of such exercise for his patient.&nbsp; The answer was only in this

<P>short note:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal

<P>to any exercise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it

<P>was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality

<P>shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she

<P>might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.

<P>In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove

<P>to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--

<P>but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,

<P>and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be
of

<P>the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--

<P>but all in vain.&nbsp; Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;

<P>Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out

<P>seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,

<P>and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,

<P>Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on

<P>no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.&nbsp; "Indeed, the truth was,

<P>that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--

<P>Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made

<P>such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,

<P>Jane would really see nobody."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,

<P>and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;

<P>neither could she feel any right of preference herself--

<P>she submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther

<P>as to her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able

<P>to assist.&nbsp; On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,

<P>and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--

<P>Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could

<P>command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an

<P>examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality

<P>was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.

<P>In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks

<P>from Miss Bates, but "dear Jane would not be satisfied without its

<P>being sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,

<P>she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering

<P>about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon

<P>of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal

<P>to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in

<P>the carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--

<P>that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her.&nbsp; She was
sorry,

<P>very sorry.&nbsp; Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed

<P>but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,

<P>inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified

<P>her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed

<P>so little worthy as a friend:&nbsp; but she had the consolation of knowing

<P>that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,

<P>that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts

<P>of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,

<P>he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.
