<P>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and

<P>Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification

<P>of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.

<P>No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores

<P>at present.&nbsp; In the daily interchange of news, they must be again

<P>restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'

<P>coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,

<P>whose health seemed every day to supply a different report,

<P>and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped

<P>might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,

<P>as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed.&nbsp; It was the delay of a great

<P>deal of pleasure and parade.&nbsp; Her introductions and recommendations

<P>must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.

<P>So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced

<P>her that every thing need not be put off.&nbsp; Why should not they

<P>explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?&nbsp; They could

<P>go there again with them in the autumn.&nbsp; It was settled that they

<P>should go to Box Hill.&nbsp; That there was to be such a party had been

<P>long generally known:&nbsp; it had even given the idea of another.

<P>Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body

<P>found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed

<P>to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.&nbsp; Two or three more

<P>of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to

<P>be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior

<P>to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,

<P>and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could

<P>not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing

<P>from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her

<P>brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,

<P>and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded

<P>to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.&nbsp; Now, as her

<P>objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,

<P>of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth

<P>bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof

<P>to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found

<P>herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she

<P>would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would

<P>probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of

<P>Mrs. Elton's party!&nbsp; Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance

<P>of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity

<P>in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad you approve of what I have done," said he very comfortably.

<P>"But I thought you would.&nbsp; Such schemes as these are nothing

<P>without numbers.&nbsp; One cannot have too large a party.&nbsp; A large
party

<P>secures its own amusement.&nbsp; And she is a good-natured woman after
all.

<P>One could not leave her out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton

<P>was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston

<P>as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw

<P>every thing into sad uncertainty.&nbsp; It might be weeks, it might
be

<P>only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations

<P>could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.

<P>Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.--"And such weather

<P>for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.

<P>What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,

<P>and nothing done.&nbsp; Before this time last year I assure you we had

<P>had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley.

<P>"That may be done without horses.&nbsp; Come, and eat my strawberries.

<P>They are ripening fast."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed
so,

<P>for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the "Oh!&nbsp; I should

<P>like it of all things," was not plainer in words than manner.

<P>Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for

<P>the invitation:&nbsp; but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would
have

<P>been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.

<P>She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than

<P>he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,

<P>such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may depend upon me," said she.&nbsp; "I certainly will come.

<P>Name your day, and I will come.&nbsp; You will allow me to bring

<P>Jane Fairfax?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some others

<P>whom I would wish to meet you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! leave all that to me.&nbsp; Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am

<P>Lady Patroness, you know.&nbsp; It is my party.&nbsp; I will bring friends

<P>with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope you will bring Elton," said he:&nbsp; "but I will not trouble

<P>you to give any other invitations."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! now you are looking very sly.&nbsp; But consider--you need not
be afraid

<P>of delegating power to me.&nbsp; I am no young lady on her preferment.

<P>Married women, you know, may be safely authorised.&nbsp; It is my party.

<P>Leave it all to me.&nbsp; I will invite your guests."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No,"--he calmly replied,--"there is but one married woman in the world

<P>whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,

<P>and that one is--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage

<P>such matters myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no

<P>one preferred to herself.--"You are a humourist, and may say what

<P>you like.&nbsp; Quite a humourist.&nbsp; Well, I shall bring Jane with
me--

<P>Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.&nbsp; I have no objections

<P>at all to meeting the Hartfield family.&nbsp; Don't scruple.&nbsp; I
know

<P>you are attached to them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call

<P>on Miss Bates in my way home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.

<P>It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.

<P>I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets

<P>hanging on my arm.&nbsp; Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.

<P>Nothing can be more simple, you see.&nbsp; And Jane will have such another.

<P>There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.&nbsp; We are

<P>to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,

<P>and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,

<P>it is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.

<P>Every thing as natural and simple as possible.&nbsp; Is not that your
idea?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite.&nbsp; My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have

<P>the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity

<P>of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think

<P>is best observed by meals within doors.&nbsp; When you are tired of
eating

<P>strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out.&nbsp; And, by
the bye,

<P>can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--

<P>Pray be sincere, Knightley.&nbsp; If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,

<P>or to inspect anything--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper

<P>is extremely clever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,

<P>and would spurn any body's assistance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish we had a donkey.&nbsp; The thing would be for us all to come

<P>on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.

<P>I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.&nbsp; In a country

<P>life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have

<P>ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut

<P>up at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,

<P>and in winter there is dirt."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.

<P>Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.&nbsp; Come
on

<P>a donkey, however, if you prefer it.&nbsp; You can borrow Mrs. Cole's.

<P>I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That I am sure you would.&nbsp; Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.

<P>Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the

<P>warmest heart.&nbsp; As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--

<P>Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention

<P>to me in the whole of this scheme.&nbsp; You have hit upon the very
thing

<P>to please me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.

<P>He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;

<P>and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors

<P>to eat would inevitably make him ill.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse must not,

<P>under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two

<P>spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was invited on good faith.&nbsp; No lurking horrors were to upbraid

<P>him for his easy credulity.&nbsp; He did consent.&nbsp; He had not been

<P>at Donwell for two years.&nbsp; "Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,

<P>and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with

<P>Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.

<P>He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of

<P>the day.&nbsp; He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,

<P>and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other

<P>of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,

<P>and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.

<P>He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--

<P>very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not

<P>fond of dining out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.

<P>The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,

<P>like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular

<P>compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high

<P>expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,

<P>promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof

<P>of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--

<P>Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad

<P>to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,

<P>and spare no arguments to induce him to come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party

<P>to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell

<P>was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather

<P>appearing exactly right.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse

<P>was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,

<P>to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most

<P>comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a

<P>fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,

<P>ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise

<P>every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--

<P>Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,

<P>and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others

<P>were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she

<P>was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him,

<P>and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with

<P>more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house

<P>and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance

<P>with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,

<P>as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,

<P>its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--

<P>its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,

<P>of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,

<P>had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,

<P>which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house

<P>was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good

<P>deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,

<P>and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,

<P>and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect

<P>for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,

<P>untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John

<P>Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.

<P>She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could

<P>raise a blush.&nbsp; These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about

<P>and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,

<P>and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,

<P>excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;

<P>and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet

<P>and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,

<P>accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,

<P>could now be thought or spoken of.--"The best fruit in England--

<P>every body's favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds

<P>and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way

<P>of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--

<P>every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--

<P>the others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--

<P>white wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--

<P>abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to

<P>be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--

<P>gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--

<P>only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--

<P>currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries

<P>the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--

<P>must go and sit in the shade."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only

<P>once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her

<P>son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--

<P>She had some fears of his horse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged

<P>to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--

<P>A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.&nbsp; Mrs.
Elton

<P>had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.

<P>It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,

<P>but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:&nbsp; it was

<P>with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,

<P>a lady known at Maple Grove.&nbsp; Delightful, charming, superior,

<P>first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton

<P>was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,

<P>all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused

<P>to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued

<P>to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,

<P>repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--

<P>Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence

<P>by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing

<P>to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,

<P>with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--

<P>"Should not they walk?&nbsp; Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--

<P>all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent."--The pertinacity

<P>of her friend seemed more than she could bear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,

<P>dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly

<P>followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short

<P>avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal

<P>distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--

<P>It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone

<P>wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,

<P>to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had

<P>been there.&nbsp; Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such

<P>a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view

<P>which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly

<P>the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper

<P>form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank

<P>of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--

<P>and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,

<P>rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river

<P>making a close and handsome curve around it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.&nbsp; English verdure,

<P>English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,

<P>without being oppressive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;

<P>and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley

<P>and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.

<P>Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was

<P>glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned

<P>her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.

<P>Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.&nbsp; There had been a time

<P>also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot

<P>so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not.

<P>It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity

<P>and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,

<P>and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,

<P>and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.

<P>He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.

<P>and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "These are my

<P>own concerns.&nbsp; I have a right to talk on such subjects, without
being

<P>suspected of introducing Robert Martin."--She did not suspect him.

<P>It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think

<P>of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade

<P>was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of

<P>the day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--

<P>and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did

<P>not come.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.&nbsp; His father
would

<P>not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could

<P>not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.

<P>He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.

<P>"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting

<P>over to them."--Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready

<P>to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint

<P>her nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston

<P>was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be

<P>by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--

<P>Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;

<P>she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more

<P>to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;

<P>perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting

<P>on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,

<P>and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken

<P>his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no

<P>damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;

<P>and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston

<P>might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety

<P>which her spirits seemed to need.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's

<P>entertainment.&nbsp; Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,

<P>corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,

<P>had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;

<P>and the kindness had perfectly answered.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse had been

<P>exceedingly well amused.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all
to him,

<P>and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other

<P>resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,

<P>for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking

<P>over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake

<P>of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot

<P>of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,

<P>coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--

<P>Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start

<P>at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say

<P>that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware

<P>how late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we

<P>shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said

<P>nothing about it to any body.&nbsp; It would only be giving trouble

<P>and distress.&nbsp; Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime
walk.

<P>Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,

<P>will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk

<P>to Highbury alone?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.&nbsp; I shall be at home

<P>in twenty minutes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.

<P>Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.

<P>It can be round in five minutes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--

<P>And for me to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have

<P>to guard others!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,

<P>"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.

<P>I must order the carriage.&nbsp; The heat even would be danger.--You
are

<P>fatigued already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am,"--she answered--"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort

<P>of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all

<P>know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.&nbsp; Mine, I confess,

<P>are exhausted.&nbsp; The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be
to let

<P>me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had not another word to oppose.&nbsp; She saw it all; and entering

<P>into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,

<P>and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.&nbsp; Her parting

<P>look was grateful--and her parting words, "Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse,

<P>the comfort of being sometimes alone!"--seemed to burst from

<P>an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual

<P>endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who

<P>loved her best.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she turned back

<P>into the hall again.&nbsp; "I do pity you.&nbsp; And the more sensibility

<P>you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only

<P>accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank

<P>Churchill entered the room.&nbsp; Emma had not been thinking of him,

<P>she had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him.

<P>Mrs. Weston would be at ease.&nbsp; The black mare was blameless;

<P>they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.

<P>He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;

<P>a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given

<P>up every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot

<P>a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,

<P>he believed he should not have come at all.&nbsp; The heat was excessive;

<P>he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid

<P>at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,

<P>etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest

<P>possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire,

<P>looking very deplorable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said Emma.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.&nbsp; I could very

<P>ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!

<P>You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.

<P>I met one as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's

<P>state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being

<P>out of humour.&nbsp; Some people were always cross when they were hot.

<P>Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating

<P>and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,

<P>she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance

<P>of every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out

<P>the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No--he should not eat.&nbsp; He was not hungry; it would only make

<P>him hotter."&nbsp; In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;

<P>and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.&nbsp; Emma returned

<P>all her attention to her father, saying in secret--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad I have done being in love with him.&nbsp; I should not like
a

<P>man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.&nbsp; Harriet's sweet

<P>easy temper will not mind it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came

<P>back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,

<P>like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest

<P>in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he

<P>should be so late.&nbsp; He was not in his best spirits, but seemed

<P>trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense

<P>very agreeably.&nbsp; They were looking over views in Swisserland.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he.

<P>"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places.

<P>You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour

<P>to read--or my poem.&nbsp; I shall do something to expose myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.&nbsp; You will

<P>never go to Swisserland.&nbsp; Your uncle and aunt will never allow

<P>you to leave England."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They may be induced to go too.&nbsp; A warm climate may be prescribed

<P>for her.&nbsp; I have more than half an expectation of our all going
abroad.

<P>I assure you I have.&nbsp; I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,

<P>that I shall soon be abroad.&nbsp; I ought to travel.&nbsp; I am tired

<P>of doing nothing.&nbsp; I want a change.&nbsp; I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--

<P>and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.&nbsp; Cannot you invent

<P>a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I sick of prosperity and indulgence!&nbsp; You are quite mistaken.

<P>I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.&nbsp; I
am

<P>thwarted in every thing material.&nbsp; I do not consider myself at
all

<P>a fortunate person."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.

<P>Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.

<P>Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,

<P>will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No--I shall not stir.&nbsp; I shall sit by you.&nbsp; You are my best
cure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.

<P>It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young

<P>man so much in want of a change.&nbsp; You will stay, and go with us?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No--It will not be worth while.&nbsp; If I come, I shall be cross."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then pray stay at Richmond."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.&nbsp; I can never bear to think

<P>of you all there without me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.

<P>Chuse your own degree of crossness.&nbsp; I shall press you no more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.

<P>With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;

<P>others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress

<P>and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained.

<P>That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with

<P>a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted.

<P>Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased

<P>so much, that his last words to Emma were,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well;--if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from

<P>Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.
