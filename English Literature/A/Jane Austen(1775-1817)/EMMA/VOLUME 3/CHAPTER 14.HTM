<P>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house

<P>from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope

<P>for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite

<P>flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed

<P>must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--

<P>how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen

<P>on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful

<P>effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,

<P>never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could

<P>summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,

<P>or even the attentive daughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him

<P>in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so

<P>anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he

<P>have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;

<P>but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,

<P>without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in

<P>the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably

<P>all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked

<P>on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they

<P>could have told him in return.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;

<P>but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised

<P>and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was

<P>the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious

<P>points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness

<P>must have some alloy.&nbsp; Her father--and Harriet.&nbsp; She could
not be

<P>alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;

<P>and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.

<P>With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.

<P>She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short

<P>parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution

<P>of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,

<P>as a sin of thought.&nbsp; While he lived, it must be only an engagement;

<P>but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of

<P>drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--

<P>How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--

<P>how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make

<P>her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--

<P>On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--

<P>and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter

<P>reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--

<P>She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a

<P>meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;

<P>that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just

<P>now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--

<P>nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation

<P>for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;

<P>and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--

<P>She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited

<P>by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--

<P>At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,

<P>from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting

<P>of the evil day, when they must all be together again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment

<P>which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,

<P>in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;

<P>and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again

<P>with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate

<P>her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have

<P>the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter

<P>was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed

<P>what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--

<P>She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted

<P>no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--

<P>and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was

<P>incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.&nbsp; She opened

<P>the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,

<P>ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding

<P>to you the enclosed.&nbsp; I know what thorough justice you will

<P>do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think

<P>we shall never materially disagree about the writer again;

<P>but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.--

<P>This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have

<P>been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday,

<P>but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being

<P>affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.--

<P>I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday

<P>afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing

<P>last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.

WINDSOR-JULY.

<P>MY DEAR MADAM,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;

<P>but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.--

<P>You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even

<P>all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--

<P>But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.

<P>My courage rises while I write.&nbsp; It is very difficult for the

<P>prosperous to be humble.&nbsp; I have already met with such success

<P>in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking

<P>myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have

<P>had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend

<P>the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls;

<P>you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept

<P>at all hazards.&nbsp; This was the fact.&nbsp; My right to place myself

<P>in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.

<P>I shall not discuss it here.&nbsp; For my temptation to think it a right,

<P>I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,

<P>and casements above, in Highbury.&nbsp; I dared not address her openly;

<P>my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well

<P>known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,

<P>before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female

<P>mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--

<P>Had she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,

<P>what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--

<P>To any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,

<P>sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.

<P>Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings

<P>secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence.

<P>If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,

<P>of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting

<P>a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses

<P>or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these

<P>circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I

<P>am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.

<P>You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax

<P>was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will

<P>forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion,

<P>by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house,

<P>so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.&nbsp; My behaviour,

<P>during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not,

<P>I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.

<P>And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my

<P>conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,

<P>or requires very solicitous explanation.&nbsp; With the greatest respect,

<P>and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father

<P>perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--

<P>A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion,

<P>and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour

<P>to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--

<P>In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led

<P>on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy

<P>into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss

<P>Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe

<P>the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,

<P>I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--

<P>Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me

<P>the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was

<P>perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much

<P>my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,

<P>friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.

<P>We seemed to understand each other.&nbsp; From our relative situation,

<P>those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss

<P>Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of

<P>that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,

<P>I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,

<P>and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no

<P>doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--

<P>She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must

<P>have penetrated a part.&nbsp; I cannot doubt it.&nbsp; You will find,

<P>whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,

<P>that it did not take her wholly by surprize.&nbsp; She frequently gave

<P>me hints of it.&nbsp; I remember her telling me at the ball, that I

<P>owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--

<P>I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted

<P>by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.

<P>While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,

<P>I could deserve nothing from either.&nbsp; Acquit me here, and procure

<P>for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that

<P>said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,

<P>as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--

<P>Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have

<P>now a key to.&nbsp; My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to
get

<P>my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.

<P>If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--

<P>Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,

<P>that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would

<P>never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--

<P>The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,

<P>my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.

<P>You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--

<P>No description can describe her.&nbsp; She must tell you herself what
she is--

<P>yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would

<P>so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,

<P>which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--

<P>She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,

<P>I dare not depend.&nbsp; I want to have your opinion of her looks.

<P>I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.

<P>Perhaps it is paid already.&nbsp; Let me hear from you without delay;

<P>I am impatient for a thousand particulars.&nbsp; Remember how few

<P>minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:

<P>and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness

<P>or misery.&nbsp; When I think of the kindness and favour I have met
with,

<P>of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad

<P>with joy:&nbsp; but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned
her,

<P>and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.

<P>If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.

<P>My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add

<P>to this long letter.&nbsp; You have not heard all that you ought to
hear.

<P>I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,

<P>and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst
out,

<P>needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you

<P>will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,

<P>I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the

<P>very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.

<P>I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have

<P>felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--

<P>But I had no choice.&nbsp; The hasty engagement she had entered into
with

<P>that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,

<P>to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,

<P>and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter

<P>what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect

<P>for me.&nbsp; I behaved shamefully.&nbsp; And here I can admit, that
my manners

<P>to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.

<P>She disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of

<P>concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;

<P>I thought unreasonably so:&nbsp; I thought her, on a thousand occasions,

<P>unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:&nbsp; I thought her even cold.

<P>But she was always right.&nbsp; If I had followed her judgment, and
subdued

<P>my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have

<P>escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--

<P>Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--There every little

<P>dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.&nbsp; I was
late;

<P>I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,

<P>but she would not suffer it.&nbsp; She absolutely refused to allow me,

<P>which I then thought most unreasonable.&nbsp; Now, however, I see nothing

<P>in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.

<P>While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one

<P>hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she

<P>to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made

<P>every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together

<P>between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--

<P>I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.

<P>I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by

<P>such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,

<P>and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been

<P>impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her

<P>resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--

<P>In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,

<P>abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,

<P>though I might have staid with you till the next morning,

<P>merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.&nbsp; Even
then,

<P>I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;

<P>but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went

<P>away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall

<P>always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.

<P>Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would

<P>ever have thought well of me again.&nbsp; Its effect upon her appears

<P>in the immediate resolution it produced:&nbsp; as soon as she found
I

<P>was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that

<P>officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,

<P>by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.

<P>I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been

<P>so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly

<P>protest against the share of it which that woman has known.--

<P>"Jane," indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself

<P>in calling her by that name, even to you.&nbsp; Think, then, what I
must

<P>have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all

<P>the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of

<P>imaginary superiority.&nbsp; Have patience with me, I shall soon have
done.--

<P>She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,

<P>and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--

<P>She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery

<P>to each:&nbsp; she dissolved it.--This letter reached me on the very

<P>morning of my poor aunt's death.&nbsp; I answered it within an hour;

<P>but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business

<P>falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all

<P>the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;

<P>and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,

<P>to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather

<P>disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;

<P>but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--

<P>too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;

<P>and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters

<P>all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,

<P>stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply

<P>to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could

<P>not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both

<P>to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,

<P>she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,

<P>that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them

<P>to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period

<P>to her at--:&nbsp; in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's,

<P>near Bristol, stared me in the face.&nbsp; I knew the name, the place,

<P>I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.

<P>It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character

<P>which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,

<P>as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive

<P>of its anxious delicacy.&nbsp; For the world would not she have seemed

<P>to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually

<P>detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--

<P>What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle.

<P>Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--

<P>I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened

<P>away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,

<P>wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!

<P>with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness

<P>in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be

<P>of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must

<P>have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while

<P>all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,

<P>and saw how ill I had made her.&nbsp; Do not pity me till I saw her
wan,

<P>sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my

<P>knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance

<P>of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was

<P>not disappointed either in the object of my journey.&nbsp; A great deal

<P>of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away.

<P>But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,

<P>and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.&nbsp; Now,
my

<P>dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.

<P>A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have

<P>ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart

<P>will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier

<P>than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me

<P>the child of good fortune.&nbsp; I hope she is right.--In one respect,

<P>my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe

<P>myself,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your obliged and affectionate Son,
