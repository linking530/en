<P>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found

<P>it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--

<P>with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton

<P>engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.&nbsp; She and Mrs. Weston were

<P>obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.

<P>Mrs. Elton left them no choice.&nbsp; If Jane repressed her for a

<P>little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed

<P>between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,

<P>there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:

<P>The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,

<P>were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must

<P>be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had

<P>yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of

<P>Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you.

<P>June will soon be here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked

<P>forward to the summer in general."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But have you really heard of nothing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware

<P>of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton,

<P>who can have thought of it as I have done?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.&nbsp; You do
not

<P>know how many candidates there always are for the first situations.

<P>I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.

<P>A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity

<P>of applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,

<P>for she moves in the first circle.&nbsp; Wax-candles in the schoolroom!

<P>You may imagine how desirable!&nbsp; Of all houses in the kingdom

<P>Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,"

<P>said Jane.&nbsp; "I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will

<P>want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself.

<P>But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries

<P>at present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.&nbsp; You are afraid of giving

<P>me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can

<P>hardly be more interested about you than I am.&nbsp; I shall write

<P>to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict

<P>charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject

<P>to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving

<P>any body trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,

<P>and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business

<P>to accomplish before us.&nbsp; Your inexperience really amuses me!

<P>A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for
you,

<P>is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice;

<P>indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no

<P>inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.

<P>When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid

<P>of being long unemployed.&nbsp; There are places in town, offices,

<P>where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--

<P>not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear, human flesh!&nbsp; You quite shock me; if you mean a fling

<P>at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather

<P>a friend to the abolition."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," replied Jane;

<P>"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;

<P>widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;

<P>but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where

<P>it lies.&nbsp; But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,

<P>and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon

<P>meeting with something that would do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; "Aye, that may

<P>suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature

<P>you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up

<P>with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,

<P>in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command

<P>the elegancies of life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;

<P>it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,

<P>I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.

<P>A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I

<P>shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will

<P>be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right

<P>to move in the first circle.&nbsp; Your musical knowledge alone would

<P>entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,

<P>and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--

<P>if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;

<P>but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,

<P>even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must

<P>and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before

<P>the Campbells or I have any rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort

<P>of such a situation together," said Jane, "they are pretty sure

<P>to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing

<P>to be attempted at present for me.&nbsp; I am exceedingly obliged to
you,

<P>Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am

<P>quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.

<P>For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as

<P>I am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am quite serious too, I assure you," replied Mrs. Elton gaily,

<P>"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends

<P>to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing

<P>till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change

<P>of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his

<P>gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature

<P>he is;--I assure you I like him excessively.&nbsp; I admire all that
quaint,

<P>old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;

<P>modern ease often disgusts me.&nbsp; But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
I assure

<P>you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.

<P>I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.

<P>How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I

<P>do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest

<P>dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.

<P>I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me.

<P>A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste

<P>is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely

<P>preferable to finery.&nbsp; But I am quite in the minority, I believe;

<P>few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery

<P>are every thing.&nbsp; I have some notion of putting such a trimming

<P>as this to my white and silver poplin.&nbsp; Do you think it will

<P>look well?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room

<P>when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.&nbsp; He had returned

<P>to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.

<P>He had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--

<P>but there was great joy.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see

<P>him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.&nbsp; John Knightley

<P>only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent

<P>his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,

<P>should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house,

<P>for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing

<P>his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,

<P>was a circumstance to strike him deeply.&nbsp; A man who had been in
motion

<P>since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,

<P>who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been

<P>in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,

<P>to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,

<P>and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into

<P>the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken

<P>back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would

<P>probably prolong rather than break up the party.&nbsp; John Knightley

<P>looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,

<P>"I could not have believed it even of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation

<P>he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all

<P>the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere

<P>from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;

<P>and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,

<P>convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants

<P>had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,

<P>was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally

<P>addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being

<P>highly interesting to every body in the room.&nbsp; He gave her a letter,

<P>it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,

<P>and had taken the liberty of opening it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Read it, read it," said he, "it will give you pleasure;

<P>only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling

<P>and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,

<P>but very audible to every body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.&nbsp; Well, what do

<P>you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,

<P>did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would

<P>not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;

<P>for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is

<P>to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.

<P>As to her illness, all nothing of course.&nbsp; But it is an excellent

<P>thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.&nbsp; They will
stay

<P>a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.

<P>This is precisely what I wanted.&nbsp; Well, pretty good news, is not
it?

<P>Have you finished it?&nbsp; Has Emma read it all?&nbsp; Put it up, put
it up;

<P>we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not

<P>do now.&nbsp; I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others
in a

<P>common way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion.

<P>Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them.&nbsp; She was happy,

<P>she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy.

<P>Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak

<P>so fluently.&nbsp; She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,

<P>and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she

<P>rather thought was considerable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative

<P>to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,

<P>and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial

<P>communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he

<P>might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley

<P>particularly delighted.&nbsp; They were the first entitled,

<P>after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would

<P>have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation

<P>with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive

<P>an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and

<P>her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.
