<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's

<P>youngest daughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry,

<P>and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,

<P>hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy

<P>remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking

<P>under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By birth she belonged to Highbury:&nbsp; and when at three years old,

<P>on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge,

<P>the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had

<P>seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;

<P>of her being taught only what very limited means could command,

<P>and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,

<P>to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,

<P>good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave

<P>a change to her destiny.&nbsp; This was Colonel Campbell, who had

<P>very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most

<P>deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for

<P>such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved

<P>his life.&nbsp; These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,

<P>though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,

<P>before his own return to England put any thing in his power.

<P>When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.

<P>He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,

<P>about Jane's age:&nbsp; and Jane became their guest, paying them long
visits

<P>and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,

<P>his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being

<P>a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell

<P>of undertaking the whole charge of her education.&nbsp; It was accepted;

<P>and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family,

<P>and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother

<P>from time to time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;

<P>the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father

<P>making independence impossible.&nbsp; To provide for her otherwise

<P>was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay

<P>and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must

<P>be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped

<P>to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such was Jane Fairfax's history.&nbsp; She had fallen into good hands,

<P>known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given

<P>an excellent education.&nbsp; Living constantly with right-minded

<P>and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received

<P>every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's

<P>residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done

<P>full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.

<P>Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that

<P>friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far

<P>as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,

<P>fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she

<P>was too much beloved to be parted with.&nbsp; Neither father nor mother

<P>could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.&nbsp; The evil
day

<P>was put off.&nbsp; It was easy to decide that she was still too young;

<P>and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all

<P>the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious

<P>mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future,

<P>the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind

<P>her that all this might soon be over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss

<P>Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party

<P>from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty

<P>and acquirements.&nbsp; That nature had given it in feature could not

<P>be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind

<P>be unfelt by the parents.&nbsp; They continued together with unabated

<P>regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,

<P>that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,

<P>giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,

<P>engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,

<P>almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly

<P>and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to
be

<P>yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path

<P>of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment

<P>had fixed on for beginning.&nbsp; She had long resolved that one-and-twenty

<P>should be the period.&nbsp; With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate,

<P>she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,

<P>and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,

<P>equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such

<P>a resolution, though their feelings did.&nbsp; As long as they lived,

<P>no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;

<P>and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;

<P>but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better

<P>be soon.&nbsp; Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder

<P>and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared

<P>her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must

<P>now be relinquished.&nbsp; Still, however, affection was glad to catch

<P>at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.

<P>She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage;

<P>and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,

<P>they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being

<P>compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,

<P>under the most favourable circumstances, to require something

<P>more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with

<P>tolerable comfort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account

<P>to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some

<P>truths not told.&nbsp; It was her own choice to give the time of their

<P>absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect

<P>liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:

<P>and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,

<P>whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement

<P>their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few

<P>months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,

<P>than on any thing else.&nbsp; Certain it was that she was to come;

<P>and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which

<P>had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for

<P>the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness

<P>of a two years' absence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did

<P>not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than

<P>she wished, and less than she ought!&nbsp; Why she did not like Jane

<P>Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley

<P>had once told her it was because she saw in her the really

<P>accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;

<P>and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,

<P>there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could

<P>not quite acquit her.&nbsp; But "she could never get acquainted with
her:

<P>she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--

<P>such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,

<P>her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss

<P>with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were

<P>to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had

<P>supposed they must be so fond of each other."&nbsp; These were her reasons--

<P>she had no better.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified

<P>by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any

<P>considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;

<P>and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'

<P>interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance

<P>and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.

<P>Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had

<P>herself the highest value for elegance.&nbsp; Her height was pretty,

<P>just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could

<P>think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most

<P>becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance

<P>of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.

<P>Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--

<P>there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;

<P>it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.&nbsp; Her eyes,

<P>a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied

<P>their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,

<P>as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed

<P>no fuller bloom.&nbsp; It was a style of beauty, of which elegance

<P>was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,

<P>by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person

<P>or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.&nbsp; There, not to be vulgar,

<P>was distinction, and merit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax

<P>with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense

<P>of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike

<P>her no longer.&nbsp; When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,

<P>as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance

<P>was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going

<P>to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion

<P>and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling

<P>her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance

<P>of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started

<P>to herself.&nbsp; In that case, nothing could be more pitiable

<P>or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.

<P>Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced

<P>Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous

<P>which her imagination had suggested at first.&nbsp; If it were love,

<P>it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.

<P>She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,

<P>while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,

<P>the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit

<P>to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from

<P>him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,

<P>as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury

<P>afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;

<P>nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were charming feelings--but not lasting.&nbsp; Before she had

<P>committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for

<P>Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices

<P>and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, "She certainly is handsome;

<P>she is better than handsome!"&nbsp; Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield

<P>with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much

<P>into its usual state.&nbsp; Former provocations reappeared.&nbsp; The
aunt

<P>was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her

<P>health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to

<P>listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter

<P>she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,

<P>as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her

<P>mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.&nbsp; They had music;

<P>Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily

<P>followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air

<P>of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very

<P>superior performance.&nbsp; She was, besides, which was the worst of
all,

<P>so cold, so cautious!&nbsp; There was no getting at her real opinion.

<P>Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined

<P>to hazard nothing.&nbsp; She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more

<P>reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.

<P>She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character,

<P>or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness

<P>of the match.&nbsp; It was all general approbation and smoothness;

<P>nothing delineated or distinguished.&nbsp; It did her no service however.

<P>Her caution was thrown away.&nbsp; Emma saw its artifice, and returned

<P>to her first surmises.&nbsp; There probably was something more to conceal

<P>than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near

<P>changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell,

<P>for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The like reserve prevailed on other topics.&nbsp; She and Mr. Frank
Churchill

<P>had been at Weymouth at the same time.&nbsp; It was known that they
were

<P>a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma

<P>procure as to what he truly was.&nbsp; "Was he handsome?"--"She believed

<P>he was reckoned a very fine young man."&nbsp; "Was he agreeable?"--

<P>"He was generally thought so."&nbsp; "Did he appear a sensible young
man;

<P>a young man of information?"--"At a watering-place, or in a common

<P>London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.

<P>Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer

<P>knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.&nbsp; She believed

<P>every body found his manners pleasing."&nbsp; Emma could not forgive
her.
