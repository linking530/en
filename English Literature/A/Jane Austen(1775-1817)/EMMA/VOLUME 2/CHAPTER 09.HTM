<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.

<P>The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day;

<P>and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side

<P>of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour

<P>of popularity.&nbsp; She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people,

<P>who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would

<P>not soon die away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were

<P>two points on which she was not quite easy.&nbsp; She doubted whether

<P>she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying

<P>her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.

<P>It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it

<P>would escape her, and his submission to all that she told,

<P>was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult

<P>for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;

<P>and there she had no doubt.&nbsp; She did unfeignedly and unequivocally

<P>regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing.&nbsp; She did

<P>most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat

<P>down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's

<P>praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't class us together, Harriet.&nbsp; My playing is no more like

<P>her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two.&nbsp; I think you play

<P>quite as well as she does.&nbsp; I am sure I had much rather hear you.

<P>Every body last night said how well you played."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.

<P>The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,

<P>but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,

<P>or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.

<P>Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked

<P>a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more

<P>than execution."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you sure?&nbsp; I saw she had execution, but I did not know she
had

<P>any taste.&nbsp; Nobody talked about it.&nbsp; And I hate Italian singing.--

<P>There is no understanding a word of it.&nbsp; Besides, if she does play

<P>so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,

<P>because she will have to teach.&nbsp; The Coxes were wondering last
night

<P>whether she would get into any great family.&nbsp; How did you think
the

<P>Coxes looked?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Just as they always do--very vulgar."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly;"

<P>but it is nothing of any consequence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful

<P>of its producing Mr. Elton.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They told me---that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him

<P>to stay to dinner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox.

<P>I do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I

<P>should go and stay there again next summer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox

<P>should be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.&nbsp; He sat

<P>by her at dinner.&nbsp; Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would

<P>be very glad to marry him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar

<P>girls in Highbury."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go

<P>with her.&nbsp; Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible,

<P>and in her present state, would be dangerous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always

<P>very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins

<P>and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could

<P>not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--

<P>Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at

<P>the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise,

<P>or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest

<P>objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on

<P>the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from

<P>shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone,

<P>and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window

<P>eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,

<P>and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.

<P>A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see

<P>nothing that does not answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She looked down the Randalls road.&nbsp; The scene enlarged;

<P>two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were

<P>walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.&nbsp; They were stopping,

<P>however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was

<P>a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked,

<P>when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road

<P>and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's

<P>engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.

<P>Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,

<P>in order to hear the new instrument.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For my companion tells me," said she, "that I absolutely promised

<P>Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.&nbsp; I was

<P>not aware of it myself.&nbsp; I did not know that I had fixed a day,

<P>but as he says I did, I am going now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"

<P>said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--

<P>if you are going home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was disappointed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you meant to go with me.&nbsp; They would be very much pleased."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!&nbsp; I should be quite in the way.&nbsp; But, perhaps--I may be
equally

<P>in the way here.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me.

<P>My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.&nbsp; She says I fidget

<P>her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say

<P>the same.&nbsp; What am I to do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only waiting

<P>for my friend.&nbsp; She will probably have soon done, and then we

<P>shall go home.&nbsp; But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear

<P>the instrument."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell

<P>should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove

<P>to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?&nbsp; I shall be no

<P>support to Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She might do very well by herself.

<P>A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I

<P>am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.--"I am persuaded

<P>that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;

<P>but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.

<P>Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion

<P>last night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeable

<P>to you.&nbsp; It need not detain us long.&nbsp; We will go to Hartfield
afterwards.

<P>We will follow them to Hartfield.&nbsp; I really wish you to call with
me.

<P>It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you

<P>meant it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,

<P>returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door.&nbsp; Emma watched them
in,

<P>and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all

<P>the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain

<P>muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon,

<P>be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.

<P>At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.--

<P>"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is

<P>at Hartfield.&nbsp; No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.

<P>But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the

<P>pattern gown home any day.&nbsp; But I shall want the ribbon directly--

<P>so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon.&nbsp; You could

<P>make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble

<P>of two parcels."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No more it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No trouble in the world, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs. Ford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.

<P>Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--

<P>I do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well

<P>have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.

<P>What do you advise?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That you do not give another half-second to the subject.

<P>To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, that will be much best," said Harriet, quite satisfied,

<P>"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies:

<P>Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across to

<P>entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,

<P>and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.

<P>How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged

<P>Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; My mother is delightfully
well;

<P>and Jane caught no cold last night.&nbsp; How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am
so glad

<P>to hear such a good account.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--

<P>Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will

<P>allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother

<P>will be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party,

<P>she cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill,

<P>`Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--

<P>But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go

<P>with me.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished

<P>my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,

<P>in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of
my

<P>mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.--

<P>So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--

<P>could not put them on.&nbsp; And, by the bye, every body ought to have

<P>two pair of spectacles; they should indeed.&nbsp; Jane said so.

<P>I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,

<P>but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,

<P>then another, there is no saying what, you know.&nbsp; At one time Patty
came

<P>to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping.&nbsp; Oh, said
I,

<P>Patty do not come with your bad news to me.&nbsp; Here is the rivet

<P>of your mistress's spectacles out.&nbsp; Then the baked apples came
home,

<P>Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and

<P>obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people

<P>say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,

<P>but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention

<P>from them.&nbsp; And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,

<P>for what is our consumption of bread, you know?&nbsp; Only three of
us.--

<P>besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such

<P>a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.

<P>I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one

<P>thing and then I say another, and it passes off.&nbsp; But about the

<P>middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes

<P>so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,

<P>for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry;

<P>I happened to meet him in the street.&nbsp; Not that I had any doubt
before--

<P>I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.

<P>I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the

<P>fruit thoroughly wholesome.&nbsp; We have apple-dumplings, however,

<P>very often.&nbsp; Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,

<P>Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will

<P>oblige us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma would be "very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.," and they

<P>did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss

<P>Bates than,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?&nbsp; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I did not
see

<P>you before.&nbsp; I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons

<P>from town.&nbsp; Jane came back delighted yesterday.&nbsp; Thank ye,

<P>the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;

<P>but Jane is taking them in."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they were

<P>all in the street.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my

<P>mother's spectacles.&nbsp; So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!

<P>`Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job

<P>of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so

<P>very. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him

<P>before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any

<P>thing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly.

<P>He seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!' said he,

<P>`I can fasten the rivet.&nbsp; I like a job of that sort excessively.'

<P>I never shall forget his manner.&nbsp; And when I brought out the baked

<P>apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very

<P>obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing

<P>in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking

<P>home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'&nbsp; That, you know, was
so

<P>very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.

<P>Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them

<P>full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,

<P>and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--

<P>but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.&nbsp; The apples

<P>themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;

<P>all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.

<P>He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such

<P>a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there

<P>is two of them.&nbsp; My mother says the orchard was always famous

<P>in her younger days.&nbsp; But I was really quite shocked the other
day--

<P>for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples,

<P>and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,

<P>and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.

<P>`I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I will send you

<P>another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.

<P>William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.

<P>I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.'

<P>So I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could

<P>not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half

<P>a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could

<P>not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he

<P>had been already; and Jane said the same.&nbsp; And when he was gone,

<P>she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled,

<P>for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed

<P>that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had

<P>made him believe we had a great many left.&nbsp; Oh, said I, my dear,

<P>I did say as much as I could.&nbsp; However, the very same evening

<P>William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same

<P>sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,

<P>and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,

<P>as you may suppose.&nbsp; William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!

<P>I am always glad to see him.&nbsp; But, however, I found afterwards

<P>from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort

<P>his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not

<P>one left to bake or boil.&nbsp; William did not seem to mind it himself,

<P>he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,

<P>you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing;

<P>but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being

<P>all sent away.&nbsp; She could not bear that her master should not be

<P>able to have another apple-tart this spring.&nbsp; He told Patty this,

<P>but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us

<P>about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as

<P>so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.

<P>And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!

<P>I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for

<P>the world!&nbsp; He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from

<P>Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was

<P>aware."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors

<P>walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,

<P>pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.

<P>Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--

<P>rather darker and narrower than one could wish.&nbsp; Miss Smith,

<P>pray take care.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure
you

<P>hit your foot.&nbsp; Miss Smith, the step at the turning."
