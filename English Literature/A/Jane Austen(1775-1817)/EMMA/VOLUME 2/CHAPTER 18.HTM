<P>"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,"

<P>said Mr. Weston.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended

<P>her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," he continued--

<P>"and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.

<P>I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we

<P>shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--

<P>He is to be in town next week, if not sooner.&nbsp; We have notice of
it

<P>in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,

<P>and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed

<P>to me--it was to Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She is his principal correspondent,

<P>I assure you.&nbsp; I hardly ever get a letter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
Mr. Weston--

<P>(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous

<P>precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow

<P>your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,

<P>we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Weston,

<P>I could not have believed it of you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, we men are sad fellows.&nbsp; You must take care of yourself,

<P>Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in

<P>a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all

<P>coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has

<P>not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--

<P>so they are all to move southward without loss of time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.&nbsp; Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London.

<P>a considerable journey."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.&nbsp; Sixty-five miles farther

<P>than from Maple Grove to London.&nbsp; But what is distance, Mr. Weston,

<P>to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,

<P>Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.&nbsp; You will hardly believe me--

<P>but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again

<P>with four horses."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The evil of the distance from Enscombe," said Mr. Weston, "is, that

<P>Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the

<P>sofa for a week together.&nbsp; In Frank's last letter she complained,

<P>he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having

<P>both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree

<P>of weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she

<P>means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.

<P>Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,

<P>Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; You must grant me that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.&nbsp; I Always take the part

<P>of my own sex.&nbsp; I do indeed.&nbsp; I give you notice--You will
find me

<P>a formidable antagonist on that point.&nbsp; I always stand up for women--

<P>and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect

<P>to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's

<P>making incredible exertions to avoid it.&nbsp; Selina says it is quite

<P>horror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety.

<P>She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.

<P>Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other

<P>fine lady ever did.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady

<P>in the land for"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.&nbsp; Selina is no fine lady,

<P>I assure you.&nbsp; Do not run away with such an idea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is not she?&nbsp; Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is

<P>as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.

<P>It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister

<P>was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence

<P>of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,

<P>when Mr. Weston went on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--

<P>but this is quite between ourselves.&nbsp; She is very fond of Frank,

<P>and therefore I would not speak ill of her.&nbsp; Besides, she is out
of

<P>health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been.

<P>I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much

<P>faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,

<P>or to Clifton?"&nbsp; "She has taken it into her head that Enscombe
is too

<P>cold for her.&nbsp; The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.

<P>She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever

<P>was before, and she begins to want change.&nbsp; It is a retired place.

<P>A fine place, but very retired."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.&nbsp; Nothing can stand more retired
from

<P>the road than Maple Grove.&nbsp; Such an immense plantation all round
it!

<P>You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--

<P>And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina

<P>to enjoy that sort of seclusion.&nbsp; Or, perhaps she may not have

<P>resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.

<P>I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel

<P>very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent

<P>of society."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I remember to have heard.&nbsp; He will find an addition to the

<P>society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume

<P>to call myself an addition.&nbsp; But perhaps he may never have heard

<P>of there being such a creature in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,

<P>and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear madam!&nbsp; Nobody but yourself could imagine such a

<P>thing possible.&nbsp; Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's

<P>letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had done his duty and could return to his son.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When Frank left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when we

<P>might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome.

<P>It has been completely unexpected.&nbsp; That is, I always had a strong

<P>persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something

<P>favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.&nbsp; He and Mrs.
Weston

<P>were both dreadfully desponding.&nbsp; `How could he contrive to come?

<P>And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare

<P>him again?' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen

<P>in our favour; and so it has, you see.&nbsp; I have observed, Mrs. Elton,

<P>in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,

<P>they are sure to mend the next."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.&nbsp; It is just what I used

<P>to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,

<P>when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all

<P>the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,

<P>and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May before

<P>Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.&nbsp; Oh! the pains I have

<P>been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!

<P>The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,

<P>I remember, he came to me quite in despair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly

<P>seized the opportunity of going on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were mentioning May.&nbsp; May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill

<P>is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place

<P>than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the

<P>agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--

<P>precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen

<P>for it:&nbsp; days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,

<P>always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.&nbsp; When
he

<P>was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal

<P>of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,

<P>and we could not do half that we intended.&nbsp; Now will be the time.

<P>This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,

<P>whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant

<P>expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,

<P>and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having

<P>him actually in the house.&nbsp; I think it is so.&nbsp; I think it
is the

<P>state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.&nbsp; I hope you

<P>will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.

<P>He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.

<P>Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,

<P>most gratifying to me.&nbsp; She thinks nobody equal to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my

<P>opinion will be decidedly in his favour.&nbsp; I have heard so much

<P>in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair

<P>to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,

<P>and are by no means implicitly guided by others.&nbsp; I give you notice

<P>that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston was musing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope," said he presently, "I have not been severe upon poor

<P>Mrs. Churchill.&nbsp; If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;

<P>but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult

<P>for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.

<P>You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,

<P>nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,

<P>the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.&nbsp; She was the instigator.

<P>Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her.

<P>Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's:

<P>his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would

<P>harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;

<P>but her pride is arrogance and insolence!&nbsp; And what inclines one
less

<P>to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.&nbsp; She was
nobody

<P>when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever

<P>since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them

<P>all in high and mighty claims:&nbsp; but in herself, I assure you, she
is

<P>an upstart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!&nbsp; I have quite

<P>a horror of upstarts.&nbsp; Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust

<P>to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood

<P>who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs

<P>they give themselves!&nbsp; Your description of Mrs. Churchill made
me

<P>think of them directly.&nbsp; People of the name of Tupman, very lately

<P>settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving

<P>themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old

<P>established families.&nbsp; A year and a half is the very utmost that
they can

<P>have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.

<P>They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,

<P>you know, Mr. Weston.&nbsp; One has not great hopes from Birmingham.

<P>I always say there is something direful in the sound:&nbsp; but nothing

<P>more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things

<P>I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently

<P>think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens

<P>to be one of their nearest neighbours.&nbsp; It is infinitely too bad.

<P>Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,

<P>and whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am

<P>almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before

<P>his death."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were interrupted.&nbsp; Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,

<P>having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of

<P>walking away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse

<P>to cards.&nbsp; The remaining five were left to their own powers,

<P>and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed

<P>little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,

<P>which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself

<P>in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.

<P>He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about

<P>the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is

<P>down at full length there we may be sure.&nbsp; My charge would be much

<P>more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit;

<P>all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,

<P>and do not physic them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I rather hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "for I shall do all

<P>in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;

<P>and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is very likely.&nbsp; You think so, do not you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--

<P>or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements

<P>continue to increase as much as they have done lately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Increase!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made

<P>a great difference in your way of life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Difference!&nbsp; No indeed I am not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company

<P>than you used to be.&nbsp; Witness this very time.&nbsp; Here am I come

<P>down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--

<P>When did it happen before, or any thing like it?&nbsp; Your neighbourhood

<P>is increasing, and you mix more with it.&nbsp; A little while ago,

<P>every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;

<P>dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.&nbsp; The difference

<P>which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less

<P>influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,

<P>that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.&nbsp; And if they are,

<P>I only beg you to send them home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence.

<P>Let them be sent to Donwell.&nbsp; I shall certainly be at leisure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me!&nbsp; I should like to
know

<P>how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being

<P>of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure

<P>to attend to the little boys.&nbsp; These amazing engagements of mine--

<P>what have they been?&nbsp; Dining once with the Coles--and having a
ball

<P>talked of, which never took place.&nbsp; I can understand you--(nodding
at

<P>Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of

<P>your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.

<P>But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom

<P>I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a

<P>series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.&nbsp; And as to my dear

<P>little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,

<P>I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,

<P>who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--

<P>and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling

<P>his accounts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded

<P>without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.
