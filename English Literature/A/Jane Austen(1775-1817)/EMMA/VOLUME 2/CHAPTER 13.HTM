<P>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.&nbsp; Her
ideas

<P>only varied as to the how much.&nbsp; At first, she thought it was a
good deal;

<P>and afterwards, but little.&nbsp; She had great pleasure in hearing
Frank

<P>Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever

<P>in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,

<P>and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was,

<P>how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance

<P>of his coming to Randalls again this spring.&nbsp; But, on the other
hand,

<P>she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the

<P>first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;

<P>she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could

<P>yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him

<P>so much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand

<P>amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,

<P>fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;

<P>the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she

<P>refused him.&nbsp; Their affection was always to subside into friendship.

<P>Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting;

<P>but still they were to part.&nbsp; When she became sensible of this,

<P>it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite

<P>of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father,

<P>never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more

<P>of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice," said she.--

<P>"In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives,

<P>is there any allusion to making a sacrifice.&nbsp; I do suspect that
he

<P>is not really necessary to my happiness.&nbsp; So much the better.

<P>I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.&nbsp; I
am

<P>quite enough in love.&nbsp; I should be sorry to be more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much

<P>in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue,

<P>I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most

<P>inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.

<P>Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto.

<P>No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would

<P>not have been so wretched.&nbsp; Could he have thought himself encouraged,

<P>his looks and language at parting would have been different.--

<P>Still, however, I must be on my guard.&nbsp; This is in the supposition

<P>of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that
I

<P>expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man--

<P>I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--

<P>His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--

<P>Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful

<P>that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well

<P>again after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;

<P>for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall

<P>have been let off easily."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;

<P>and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made

<P>her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she

<P>had undervalued their strength.&nbsp; It was a long, well-written letter,

<P>giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,

<P>expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was

<P>natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local

<P>that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.

<P>No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the

<P>language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition

<P>from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some

<P>of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on

<P>to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been

<P>said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own

<P>name was not wanting.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once,

<P>and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a

<P>compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;

<P>and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it

<P>was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern

<P>the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment

<P>perhaps of all conveyed.&nbsp; Compressed into the very lowest vacant

<P>corner were these words--"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,

<P>as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.&nbsp; Pray
make

<P>my excuses and adieus to her."&nbsp; This, Emma could not doubt, was
all

<P>for herself.&nbsp; Harriet was remembered only from being her friend.

<P>His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor

<P>better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,

<P>and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for

<P>coming to Randalls again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the

<P>material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up

<P>and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,

<P>that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn

<P>to do without her.&nbsp; Her intentions were unchanged.&nbsp; Her resolution

<P>of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for

<P>his subsequent consolation and happiness.&nbsp; His recollection of
Harriet,

<P>and the words which clothed it, the "beautiful little friend,"

<P>suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections.

<P>Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his

<P>inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with

<P>the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;

<P>and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in

<P>her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must not dwell upon it," said she.--"I must not think of it.

<P>I know the danger of indulging such speculations.&nbsp; But stranger

<P>things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other

<P>as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort

<P>of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward

<P>to with pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf,

<P>though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil

<P>in that quarter was at hand.&nbsp; As Frank Churchill's arrival had

<P>succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,

<P>as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now

<P>upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were

<P>assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.

<P>He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.

<P>There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe

<P>before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was in every body's mouth,

<P>and Frank Churchill was forgotten.&nbsp; Emma grew sick at the sound.

<P>She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;

<P>and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately

<P>gaining strength.&nbsp; With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,

<P>there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;

<P>but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state

<P>of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,

<P>bell-ringing, and all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the

<P>reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma

<P>could give.&nbsp; Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,

<P>that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;

<P>but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing

<P>any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions

<P>the same.&nbsp; Harriet listened submissively, and said "it was very
true--

<P>it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to

<P>think about them--and she would not think about them any longer"

<P>but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour

<P>saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.

<P>At last Emma attacked her on another ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about

<P>Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can

<P>make me.&nbsp; You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake
I

<P>fell into.&nbsp; It was all my doing, I know.&nbsp; I have not forgotten
it,

<P>I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--

<P>and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.&nbsp; Do not imagine

<P>me in danger of forgetting it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words

<P>of eager exclamation.&nbsp; Emma continued,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,

<P>talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,

<P>I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important

<P>than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration

<P>of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour

<P>to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,

<P>and restore your tranquillity.&nbsp; These are the motives which I

<P>have been pressing on you.&nbsp; They are very important--and sorry

<P>I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.

<P>My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.&nbsp; I
want

<P>you to save yourself from greater pain.&nbsp; Perhaps I may sometimes

<P>have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather

<P>what would be kind by me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.

<P>The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,

<P>whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,

<P>and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained

<P>powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it

<P>very tolerably.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--

<P>Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody

<P>as I do for you!--Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look

<P>and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet

<P>so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," said she

<P>afterwards to herself.&nbsp; "There is nothing to be compared to it.

<P>Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,

<P>will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,

<P>I am sure it will.&nbsp; It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear

<P>father so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--

<P>I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is

<P>my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.

<P>Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,

<P>longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.&nbsp; Oh! the coldness

<P>of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--

<P>a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.&nbsp; I mention no names;

<P>but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"
