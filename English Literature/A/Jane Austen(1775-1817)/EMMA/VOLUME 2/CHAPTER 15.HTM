<P>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill

<P>opinion of Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; Her observation had been pretty correct.

<P>Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,

<P>such she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,

<P>familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a

<P>little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself

<P>coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve

<P>a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held

<P>such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently

<P>from his wife.&nbsp; He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.

<P>He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such

<P>a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;

<P>and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,

<P>or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's

<P>good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever

<P>and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;

<P>so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it

<P>ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her

<P>first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "very

<P>pleasant and very elegantly dressed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared

<P>at first.&nbsp; Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,

<P>by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,

<P>she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold

<P>and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will

<P>which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike.

<P>Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.

<P>They were sneering and negligent.&nbsp; Emma hoped it must rapidly work

<P>Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour

<P>sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor

<P>Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,

<P>and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable

<P>to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been

<P>given also.&nbsp; She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--

<P>When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin

<P>abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew

<P>in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous

<P>treatment of Harriet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.

<P>Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be

<P>supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she

<P>was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--

<P>but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting

<P>to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,

<P>and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's

<P>knight-errantry on the subject.--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite

<P>rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.&nbsp; So mild

<P>and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she

<P>has very extraordinary talents.&nbsp; I do not scruple to say that she

<P>plays extremely well.&nbsp; I know enough of music to speak decidedly

<P>on that point.&nbsp; Oh! she is absolutely charming!&nbsp; You will
laugh at

<P>my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--

<P>And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,

<P>we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.

<P>We must bring her forward.&nbsp; Such talent as hers must not be suffered

<P>to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of

<P>the poet,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Full many a flower is born
to blush unseen,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `And waste its
fragrance on the desert air.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm answer--

<P>"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation

<P>and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,

<P>I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,

<P>such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have

<P>enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!&nbsp; And I think

<P>she feels it.&nbsp; I am sure she does.&nbsp; She is very timid and
silent.

<P>One can see that she feels the want of encouragement.&nbsp; I like her

<P>the better for it.&nbsp; I must confess it is a recommendation to me.

<P>I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does

<P>not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,

<P>it is extremely prepossessing.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I assure you, Jane Fairfax

<P>is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I

<P>can express."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any

<P>of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known

<P>her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare

<P>to act.&nbsp; You and I need not be afraid.&nbsp; If we set the example,

<P>many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not

<P>our situations.&nbsp; We have carriages to fetch and convey her home,

<P>and we live in a style which could not make the addition of

<P>Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be

<P>extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,

<P>as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax

<P>to partake of it.&nbsp; I have no idea of that sort of thing.&nbsp;
It is

<P>not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to.

<P>My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the

<P>other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.

<P>Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--

<P>for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,

<P>in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--

<P>I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce

<P>her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,

<P>and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.

<P>My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt

<P>of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,

<P>of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come

<P>to us.&nbsp; I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets

<P>a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,

<P>for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is

<P>highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they

<P>are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in

<P>the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Jane Fairfax!"--thought Emma.--"You have not deserved this.

<P>You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a

<P>punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection

<P>of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp;
Let me

<P>not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--

<P>But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness

<P>of that woman's tongue!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively

<P>addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a "dear Miss

<P>Woodhouse."&nbsp; The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,

<P>and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular

<P>friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very

<P>active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a

<P>general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was
done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for

<P>Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless

<P>simplicity and warmth.&nbsp; She was quite one of her worthies--

<P>the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished

<P>and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.

<P>Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept

<P>those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do.

<P>She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,

<P>spending a day with the Eltons!&nbsp; This was astonishing!--She could
not

<P>have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax

<P>could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.--"To chuse to remain

<P>here month after month, under privations of every sort!&nbsp; And now

<P>to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury

<P>of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions

<P>who have always loved her with such real, generous affection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells

<P>were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells

<P>had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,

<P>and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.

<P>According to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had

<P>written most pressingly.&nbsp; Would Jane but go, means were to be found,

<P>servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed

<P>to exist; but still she had declined it!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing

<P>this invitation," was Emma's conclusion.&nbsp; "She must be under some

<P>sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.

<P>There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--

<P>She is not to be with the Dixons.&nbsp; The decree is issued by somebody.

<P>But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a

<P>separate puzzle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,

<P>before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston

<P>ventured this apology for Jane.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,

<P>my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.

<P>Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,

<P>must be very tiresome.&nbsp; We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,

<P>before we condemn her taste for what she goes to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are right, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "Miss Fairfax

<P>is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.

<P>Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have

<P>chosen her.&nbsp; But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives

<P>attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;

<P>and she was herself struck by his warmth.&nbsp; With a faint blush,

<P>she presently replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined,

<P>would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton's

<P>invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should not wonder," said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were to have

<P>been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness

<P>in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her.&nbsp; Poor Miss Bates
may

<P>very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater

<P>appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,

<P>in spite of the very natural wish of a little change."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few

<P>minutes silence, he said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton

<P>does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her.&nbsp; We all know

<P>the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest

<P>spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond

<P>common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--

<P>a something more early implanted.&nbsp; We cannot give any body the

<P>disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.

<P>We feel things differently.&nbsp; And besides the operation of this,

<P>as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes

<P>Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,

<P>face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she

<P>has a claim to.&nbsp; Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell

<P>in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent

<P>her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not

<P>in consciousness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax," said Emma.

<P>Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy

<P>made her irresolute what else to say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,

<P>but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--

<P>she hurried on--"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself

<P>how highly it is.&nbsp; The extent of your admiration may take you by

<P>surprize some day or other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick

<P>leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,

<P>or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.&nbsp; Mr. Cole

<P>gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did

<P>not herself know what to think.&nbsp; In a moment he went on--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That will never be, however, I can assure you.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax,

<P>I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very

<P>sure I shall never ask her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased

<P>enough to exclaim,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; I will say that for you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner

<P>which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No indeed I have not.&nbsp; You have scolded me too much for match-making,

<P>for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.&nbsp; What I said

<P>just now, meant nothing.&nbsp; One says those sort of things, of course,

<P>without any idea of a serious meaning.&nbsp; Oh! no, upon my word I
have not

<P>the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.

<P>You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,

<P>if you were married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.&nbsp; The result of his reverie
was,

<P>"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will

<P>ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,

<P>I assure you."&nbsp; And soon afterwards, "Jane Fairfax is a very charming

<P>young woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.&nbsp; She has a fault.

<P>She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.

<P>"Well," said she, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very soon.&nbsp; He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;

<P>he asked my pardon and said no more.&nbsp; Cole does not want to be
wiser

<P>or wittier than his neighbours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser

<P>and wittier than all the world!&nbsp; I wonder how she speaks of the
Coles--

<P>what she calls them!&nbsp; How can she find any appellation for them,

<P>deep enough in familiar vulgarity?&nbsp; She calls you, Knightley--what
can

<P>she do for Mr. Cole?&nbsp; And so I am not to be surprized that Jane

<P>Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.

<P>Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.&nbsp; I can much more

<P>readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,

<P>than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over

<P>Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself

<P>the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any

<P>restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot

<P>imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor

<P>with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not
be

<P>continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring

<P>her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful

<P>exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley--"I do not

<P>accuse her of want of feeling.&nbsp; Her sensibilities, I suspect,

<P>are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,

<P>patience, self-controul; but it wants openness.&nbsp; She is reserved,

<P>more reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an

<P>open temper.&nbsp; No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,

<P>it had never entered my head.&nbsp; I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed
with

<P>her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Mrs. Weston," said Emma triumphantly when he left them,

<P>"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied

<P>by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder

<P>if it were to end in his being so at last.&nbsp; Do not beat me."
