<P>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:&nbsp; but though devotion might

<P>be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,

<P>and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,

<P>to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,

<P>or not pretty at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,

<P>to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;

<P>and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of

<P>the business might be gone through as soon as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room

<P>to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,

<P>to lace up her boot, without recollecting.&nbsp; A thousand vexatious

<P>thoughts would recur.&nbsp; Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;

<P>and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be

<P>recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather

<P>pale and silent.&nbsp; The visit was of course short; and there was
so

<P>much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma

<P>would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,

<P>and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms

<P>of being "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did not really like her.&nbsp; She would not be in a hurry to find
fault,

<P>but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--

<P>She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,

<P>there was too much ease.&nbsp; Her person was rather good; her face

<P>not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,

<P>were elegant.&nbsp; Emma thought at least it would turn out so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would

<P>not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.

<P>It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,

<P>and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.

<P>The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,

<P>and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own

<P>good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly

<P>unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with

<P>the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,

<P>and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him

<P>to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,

<P>and as little really easy as could be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted

<P>the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;

<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--

<P>Is not she very charming?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;

<P>and she came in his way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she

<P>was very much attached to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the

<P>woman who loves him best.&nbsp; Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,

<P>and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody could ever

<P>have a better.&nbsp; Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.&nbsp;
And now,

<P>Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.

<P>He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,

<P>it is quite a different thing.&nbsp; No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you
need

<P>not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.

<P>To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--

<P>She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.

<P>Happy creature!&nbsp; He called her `Augusta.'&nbsp; How delightful!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.&nbsp; She could
then

<P>see more and judge better.&nbsp; From Harriet's happening not to be

<P>at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,

<P>she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,

<P>and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite

<P>convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well

<P>satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;

<P>that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which

<P>had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her

<P>notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;

<P>that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would

<P>certainly do Mr. Elton no good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet would have been a better match.&nbsp; If not wise or refined
herself,

<P>she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,

<P>it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best

<P>of her own set.&nbsp; The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride

<P>of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride

<P>of him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "My brother

<P>Mr. Suckling's seat;"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.

<P>The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the

<P>house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably

<P>impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she

<P>could see or imagine.&nbsp; "Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was
quite

<P>struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size

<P>of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room."--

<P>Mr. Elton was appealed to.--"Was not it astonishingly like?--

<P>She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like

<P>the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.

<P>I really could not help exclaiming!&nbsp; I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so

<P>extremely partial to as Maple Grove.&nbsp; I have spent so many happy

<P>months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,

<P>undoubtedly.&nbsp; Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;

<P>but to me, it has been quite a home.&nbsp; Whenever you are transplanted,

<P>like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it

<P>is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.

<P>I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient

<P>for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So extremely like Maple Grove!&nbsp; And it is not merely the house--

<P>the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly

<P>like.&nbsp; The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as
here,

<P>and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;

<P>and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,

<P>which put me so exactly in mind!&nbsp; My brother and sister will be

<P>enchanted with this place.&nbsp; People who have extensive grounds

<P>themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.&nbsp; She had a great idea

<P>that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little

<P>for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth

<P>while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said

<P>in reply,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think

<P>you have overrated Hartfield.&nbsp; Surry is full of beauties."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.&nbsp; It is the garden of England,

<P>you know.&nbsp; Surry is the garden of England."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.

<P>Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,

<P>as well as Surry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile."

<P>I never heard any county but Surry called so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was silenced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,

<P>or summer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be

<P>our time for exploring.&nbsp; While they are with us, we shall explore

<P>a great deal, I dare say.&nbsp; They will have their barouche-landau,

<P>of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying

<P>any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different

<P>beauties extremely well.&nbsp; They would hardly come in their chaise,

<P>I think, at that season of the year.&nbsp; Indeed, when the time draws
on,

<P>I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;

<P>it will be so very much preferable.&nbsp; When people come into a beautiful

<P>country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes

<P>them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond

<P>of exploring.&nbsp; We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer,

<P>in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the

<P>barouche-landau.&nbsp; You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,

<P>Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No; not immediately here.&nbsp; We are rather out of distance of the
very

<P>striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;

<P>and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed

<P>to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.

<P>Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am.&nbsp; I was quite

<P>a proverb for it at Maple Grove.&nbsp; Many a time has Selina said,

<P>when she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl

<P>to move from the house.&nbsp; I absolutely must go in by myself, though
I

<P>hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;

<P>but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir

<P>beyond the park paling.'&nbsp; Many a time has she said so; and yet
I

<P>am no advocate for entire seclusion.&nbsp; I think, on the contrary,

<P>when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very

<P>bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in

<P>a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.

<P>I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--

<P>(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must

<P>be a great drawback.&nbsp; Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should.

<P>Let me recommend Bath to you.&nbsp; I assure you I have no doubt of
its doing

<P>Mr. Woodhouse good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving

<P>any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown

<P>to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be

<P>useful now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief

<P>they give.&nbsp; In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!

<P>And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of

<P>use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes

<P>much depressed.&nbsp; And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy
I

<P>need not take much pains to dwell on them.&nbsp; The advantages of Bath

<P>to the young are pretty generally understood.&nbsp; It would be a charming

<P>introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could

<P>immediately secure you some of the best society in the place.

<P>A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my

<P>particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided

<P>with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,

<P>and would be the very person for you to go into public with."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.

<P>The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called

<P>an introduction--of her going into public under the auspices

<P>of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,

<P>who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--

<P>The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could

<P>have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their going

<P>to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly

<P>convinced that the place might suit her better than her father."

<P>And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the

<P>subject directly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; Upon these
occasions,

<P>a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long

<P>known that you are a superior performer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.

<P>A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.

<P>Consider from how partial a quarter your information came.

<P>I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends

<P>say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,

<P>upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree.

<P>You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.&nbsp; I assure
you

<P>it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,

<P>to hear what a musical society I am got into.&nbsp; I absolutely cannot

<P>do without music.&nbsp; It is a necessary of life to me; and having
always

<P>been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,

<P>it would have been a most serious sacrifice.&nbsp; I honestly said as
much

<P>to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing

<P>his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;

<P>and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been

<P>accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.

<P>When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the

<P>world I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear

<P>of retirement.&nbsp; Blessed with so many resources within myself,

<P>the world was not necessary to me.&nbsp; I could do very well without
it.

<P>To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my

<P>resources made me quite independent.&nbsp; And as to smaller-sized rooms

<P>than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought.

<P>I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.

<P>Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but
I

<P>did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,

<P>nor were spacious apartments.&nbsp; `But,' said I, `to be quite honest,

<P>I do not think I can live without something of a musical society.

<P>I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank

<P>to me.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mr. Elton would hesitate

<P>to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury;

<P>and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than

<P>may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.&nbsp; I am delighted

<P>to find myself in such a circle.&nbsp; I hope we shall have many sweet

<P>little concerts together.&nbsp; I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I

<P>must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings

<P>at your house, or ours.&nbsp; Will not it be a good plan?&nbsp; If we

<P>exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.

<P>Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me,

<P>as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--

<P>there is a sad story against them, in general.&nbsp; They are but too
apt

<P>to give up music."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can

<P>be no danger, surely?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,

<P>I tremble.&nbsp; Selina has entirely given up music--never touches

<P>the instrument--though she played sweetly.&nbsp; And the same may be
said

<P>of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,

<P>now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.

<P>Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.&nbsp; I used to be

<P>quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend

<P>that a married woman has many things to call her attention.

<P>I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon

<P>be in so regular a train--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,

<P>had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton

<P>chose another subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them

<P>both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.

<P>I like them extremely.&nbsp; Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--

<P>quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.

<P>And she appears so truly good--there is something so motherly

<P>and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.

<P>She was your governess, I think?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton

<P>hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her

<P>so very lady-like!&nbsp; But she is really quite the gentlewoman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly good.

<P>Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest

<P>model for any young woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And who do you think came in while we were there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was quite at a loss.&nbsp; The tone implied some old acquaintance--

<P>and how could she possibly guess?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!--Was not

<P>it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,

<P>I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a

<P>friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.&nbsp; `My friend Knightley'

<P>had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;

<P>and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not

<P>be ashamed of his friend.&nbsp; Knightley is quite the gentleman.

<P>I like him very much.&nbsp; Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like
man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Happily, it was now time to be gone.&nbsp; They were off; and Emma

<P>could breathe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation.&nbsp; "Worse than
I

<P>had supposed.&nbsp; Absolutely insufferable!&nbsp; Knightley!--I could
not

<P>have believed it.&nbsp; Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,

<P>and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!

<P>A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo,

<P>and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and

<P>underbred finery.&nbsp; Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is

<P>a gentleman!&nbsp; I doubt whether he will return the compliment,

<P>and discover her to be a lady.&nbsp; I could not have believed it!

<P>And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!

<P>One would fancy we were bosom friends!&nbsp; And Mrs. Weston!--

<P>Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be

<P>a gentlewoman!&nbsp; Worse and worse.&nbsp; I never met with her equal.

<P>Much beyond my hopes.&nbsp; Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.

<P>Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?

<P>How angry and how diverted he would be!&nbsp; Ah! there I am--

<P>thinking of him directly.&nbsp; Always the first person to be thought
of!

<P>How I catch myself out!&nbsp; Frank Churchill comes as regularly into

<P>my mind!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time

<P>her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'

<P>departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable

<P>of attending.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, my dear," he deliberately began, "considering we never saw

<P>her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say

<P>she was very much pleased with you.&nbsp; She speaks a little too quick.

<P>A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.

<P>But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks

<P>like you and poor Miss Taylor.&nbsp; However, she seems a very obliging,

<P>pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.

<P>Though I think he had better not have married.&nbsp; I made the best

<P>excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton

<P>on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course

<P>of the summer.&nbsp; But I ought to have gone before.&nbsp; Not to wait
upon

<P>a bride is very remiss.&nbsp; Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!

<P>But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.&nbsp; Mr. Elton knows
you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes:&nbsp; but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects

<P>to her if possible.&nbsp; It was being very deficient."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore

<P>why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride?

<P>It ought to be no recommendation to you.&nbsp; It is encouraging people

<P>to marry if you make so much of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would

<P>always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,

<P>especially, is never to be neglected.&nbsp; More is avowedly due to
her.

<P>A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,

<P>let the others be who they may."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know

<P>what is.&nbsp; And I should never have expected you to be lending your

<P>sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, you do not understand me.&nbsp; This is a

<P>matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,

<P>and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had done.&nbsp; Her father was growing nervous, and could not

<P>understand her.&nbsp; Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences,

<P>and long, very long, did they occupy her.
