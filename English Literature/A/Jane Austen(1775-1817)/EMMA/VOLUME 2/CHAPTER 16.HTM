<P>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,

<P>was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.&nbsp; Dinner-parties
and

<P>evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations

<P>flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending

<P>they were never to have a disengaged day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I see how it is," said she.&nbsp; "I see what a life I am to lead

<P>among you.&nbsp; Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.

<P>We really seem quite the fashion.&nbsp; If this is living in the country,

<P>it is nothing very formidable.&nbsp; From Monday next to Saturday,

<P>I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer

<P>resources than I have, need not have been at a loss."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No invitation came amiss to her.&nbsp; Her Bath habits made evening-parties

<P>perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste

<P>for dinners.&nbsp; She was a little shocked at the want of two

<P>drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being

<P>no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,

<P>Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge

<P>of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought

<P>to be arranged.&nbsp; In the course of the spring she must return their

<P>civilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables

<P>should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs

<P>in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening

<P>than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round

<P>the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner

<P>at Hartfield for the Eltons.&nbsp; They must not do less than others,

<P>or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable

<P>of pitiful resentment.&nbsp; A dinner there must be.&nbsp; After Emma
had

<P>talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,

<P>and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom

<P>of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding

<P>who should do it for him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The persons to be invited, required little thought.&nbsp; Besides the
Eltons,

<P>it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--

<P>and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must

<P>be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given

<P>with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly

<P>pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.

<P>"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.

<P>She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy

<P>wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.&nbsp; If Miss Woodhouse

<P>would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home."

<P>It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it

<P>possible enough for wishing.&nbsp; She was delighted with the fortitude

<P>of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give

<P>up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the

<P>very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--

<P>Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,

<P>she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had

<P>often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.&nbsp; He had said

<P>that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody

<P>else paid her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is very true," said she, "at least as far as relates to me,

<P>which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same
age--

<P>and always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--

<P>She will never like me now.&nbsp; I have neglected her too long.&nbsp;
But I

<P>will shew her greater attention than I have done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Every invitation was successful.&nbsp; They were all disengaged and
all happy.--

<P>The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.

<P>A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.&nbsp; The two eldest little

<P>Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of

<P>some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,

<P>and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be

<P>the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did

<P>not allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were

<P>disturbed by its happening so.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse considered eight

<P>persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--

<P>and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would

<P>be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even

<P>to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,

<P>by representing that though he certainly would make them nine,

<P>yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be

<P>very immaterial.&nbsp; She thought it in reality a sad exchange for
herself,

<P>to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed

<P>to her instead of his brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.

<P>John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town

<P>and must be absent on the very day.&nbsp; He might be able to join them

<P>in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse was
quite

<P>at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys

<P>and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,

<P>removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley

<P>seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.

<P>Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited

<P>for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton, as elegant

<P>as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--

<P>wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss

<P>Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could

<P>talk to her.&nbsp; He had met her before breakfast as he was returning

<P>from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning

<P>to rain.&nbsp; It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,

<P>and he said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I

<P>am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.

<P>I hope you turned directly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I went only to the post-office," said she, "and reached home

<P>before the rain was much.&nbsp; It is my daily errand.&nbsp; I always
fetch

<P>the letters when I am here.&nbsp; It saves trouble, and is a something

<P>to get me out.&nbsp; A walk before breakfast does me good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six

<P>yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;

<P>and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.

<P>The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.

<P>When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are

<P>never worth going through the rain for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a little blush, and then this answer,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of

<P>every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply

<P>growing older should make me indifferent about letters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indifferent!&nbsp; Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.

<P>Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very

<P>positive curse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters

<P>of friendship."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he coolly.

<P>"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly

<P>ever does."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! you are not serious now.&nbsp; I know Mr. John Knightley too well--

<P>I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as

<P>any body.&nbsp; I can easily believe that letters are very little to
you,

<P>much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than

<P>myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.

<P>You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,

<P>never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,

<P>a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,

<P>in worse weather than to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,"

<P>said John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of situation

<P>which time usually brings.&nbsp; I consider one as including the other.

<P>Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within

<P>the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.

<P>As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten

<P>years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.&nbsp; A pleasant

<P>"thank you" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,

<P>a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.

<P>Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,

<P>according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of

<P>his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,

<P>was ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this

<P>morning in the rain.&nbsp; Young ladies should take care of themselves.--

<P>Young ladies are delicate plants.&nbsp; They should take care of their

<P>health and their complexion.&nbsp; My dear, did you change your stockings?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind

<P>solicitude about me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--

<P>I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.&nbsp; They are some

<P>of my very old friends.&nbsp; I wish my health allowed me to be a

<P>better neighbour.&nbsp; You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am
sure.

<P>My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,

<P>and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel

<P>that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,

<P>and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office

<P>in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,

<P>how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there

<P>to take care of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! do not tell me.&nbsp; You really are a very sad girl, and do not

<P>know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!

<P>Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?&nbsp; You and I must positively

<P>exert our authority."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I certainly

<P>do feel tempted to give.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--

<P>Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought

<P>to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.

<P>The spring I always think requires more than common care.

<P>Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,

<P>than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.&nbsp; Now do not
you

<P>feel that you had?&nbsp; Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.

<P>You look as if you would not do such a thing again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! she shall not do such a thing again," eagerly rejoined

<P>Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; "We will not allow her to do such a thing again:"--

<P>and nodding significantly--"there must be some arrangement made,

<P>there must indeed.&nbsp; I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches

<P>our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)

<P>shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.&nbsp; That will obviate

<P>all difficulties you know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane,

<P>you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my

<P>early walk.&nbsp; I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,

<P>I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon

<P>my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Jane, say no more about it.&nbsp; The thing is determined,

<P>that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine

<P>any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.&nbsp; You know,

<P>Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.

<P>But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely

<P>worn out.&nbsp; If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,

<P>consider that point as settled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent

<P>to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.

<P>If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it

<P>always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness

<P>to employ our men."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead

<P>of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she.--

<P>"The regularity and despatch of it!&nbsp; If one thinks of all that
it

<P>has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is certainly very well regulated."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!&nbsp; So seldom

<P>that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing

<P>about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,

<P>I suppose, actually lost!&nbsp; And when one considers the variety

<P>of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,

<P>it increases the wonder."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some

<P>quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.&nbsp; If you

<P>want any farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are

<P>paid for it.&nbsp; That is the key to a great deal of capacity.

<P>The public pays and must be served well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual

<P>observations made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same

<P>sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the

<P>same master teaches, it is natural enough.&nbsp; But for that reason,

<P>I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,

<P>for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble

<P>into any hand they can get.&nbsp; Isabella and Emma, I think, do write

<P>very much alike.&nbsp; I have not always known their writing apart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness.

<P>I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse;

<P>"and always did.&nbsp; And so does poor Mrs. Weston"--with half a sigh

<P>and half a smile at her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"--Emma began, looking also

<P>at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was

<P>attending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,

<P>"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking

<P>his name at once before all these people?&nbsp; Is it necessary

<P>for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--

<P>your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,

<P>if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the

<P>smallest distress.&nbsp; I certainly get better and better.--Now for
it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--"Mr. Frank Churchill

<P>writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; "It is too small--

<P>wants strength.&nbsp; It is like a woman's writing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was not submitted to by either lady.&nbsp; They vindicated him

<P>against the base aspersion.&nbsp; "No, it by no means wanted strength--

<P>it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.

<P>Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?"&nbsp; No, she
had

<P>heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put

<P>it away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had my writing-desk,

<P>I am sure I could produce a specimen.&nbsp; I have a note of his.--

<P>Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you

<P>one day?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He chose to say he was employed"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner

<P>to convince Mr. Knightley."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,"

<P>said Mr. Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,

<P>he will, of course, put forth his best."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,

<P>was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request

<P>to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Must I go first?&nbsp; I really am ashamed of always leading the way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.

<P>She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know

<P>whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.&nbsp; She suspected

<P>that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered

<P>but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,

<P>and that it had not been in vain.&nbsp; She thought there was an air

<P>of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition

<P>and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--

<P>but she abstained.&nbsp; She was quite determined not to utter a word

<P>that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed

<P>the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance

<P>of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.
