<P>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in

<P>interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries

<P>or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first

<P>mentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other,

<P>discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind;

<P>to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable:

<P>and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects,

<P>and circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more

<P>for him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose

<P>music she principally played.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man.&nbsp; He had gone away rejected

<P>and mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series

<P>of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing

<P>the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very

<P>wrong one.&nbsp; He had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged

<P>to another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first,

<P>as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.

<P>He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing

<P>for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages

<P>of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,

<P>of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of

<P>some dignity, as well as some convenience:&nbsp; the story told well;

<P>he had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l.

<P>or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--

<P>the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by

<P>distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole

<P>of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps

<P>so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's,

<P>and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--

<P>with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady

<P>had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,

<P>to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,

<P>that vanity and prudence were equally contented.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,

<P>and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself

<P>and his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be

<P>laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing

<P>all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,

<P>he would have been more cautiously gallant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves

<P>to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for;

<P>and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation,

<P>which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict,

<P>that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just

<P>enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her

<P>the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique

<P>and pretension, now spread over his air.&nbsp; She was, in fact,

<P>beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing

<P>at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very

<P>disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance,

<P>a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind,

<P>she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.

<P>She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare

<P>twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly

<P>be lessened by his marriage.&nbsp; Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--

<P>many awkwardnesses smoothed by it.&nbsp; A Mrs. Elton would be an excuse
for

<P>any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.

<P>It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.&nbsp; She was good

<P>enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--

<P>handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side.

<P>As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,

<P>that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,

<P>he had done nothing.&nbsp; On that article, truth seemed attainable.

<P>What she was, must be uncertain; but who she was, might be found out;

<P>and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at

<P>all Harriet's superior.&nbsp; She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.

<P>Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--

<P>merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the

<P>profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was

<P>not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very

<P>moderate also.&nbsp; Part of every winter she had been used to spend
in Bath;

<P>but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though

<P>the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--

<P>in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded

<P>of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter

<P>had lived.&nbsp; Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,

<P>and too stupid to rise.&nbsp; And all the grandeur of the connexion

<P>seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well married,

<P>to a gentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!

<P>That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of

<P>Miss Hawkins.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!

<P>She had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be

<P>talked out of it.&nbsp; The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies

<P>of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away.&nbsp; He might be superseded

<P>by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer;

<P>even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,

<P>she feared, would cure her.&nbsp; Harriet was one of those, who,

<P>having once begun, would be always in love.&nbsp; And now, poor girl!

<P>she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.

<P>She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.&nbsp; Emma
saw

<P>him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure

<P>just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice,

<P>or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him

<P>in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.

<P>She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when

<P>at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,

<P>and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;

<P>and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already

<P>occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,

<P>comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually

<P>in agitation around her.&nbsp; Her regard was receiving strength by

<P>invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings

<P>irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness,

<P>and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--

<P>his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat,

<P>being all in proof of how much he was in love!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain

<P>to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of

<P>Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.

<P>Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each

<P>was occasionally useful as a check to the other.&nbsp; Mr. Elton's

<P>engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin.

<P>The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been

<P>a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's

<P>a few days afterwards.&nbsp; Harriet had not been at home; but a note
had

<P>been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;

<P>a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness;

<P>and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied

<P>by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,

<P>and wishing to do more than she dared to confess.&nbsp; But Mr. Elton,

<P>in person, had driven away all such cares.&nbsp; While he staid,

<P>the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off

<P>for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,

<P>judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--

<P>and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful

<P>consideration.&nbsp; Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,

<P>when invited to come, would be ingratitude.&nbsp; It must not be:

<P>and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's

<P>returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,

<P>should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.

<P>She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill,

<P>while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon,

<P>as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous

<P>recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what

<P>degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could think of nothing better:&nbsp; and though there was something

<P>in it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,

<P>merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?
