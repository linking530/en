<P>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,

<P>was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,

<P>slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table

<P>near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,

<P>standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most

<P>happy countenance on seeing Emma again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is a pleasure," said he, in rather a low voice, "coming at

<P>least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.&nbsp; You find me

<P>trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!" said Mrs. Weston, "have not you finished it yet? you would

<P>not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not been working uninterruptedly," he replied, "I have been

<P>assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,

<P>it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.

<P>You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.&nbsp; This was very
kind

<P>of you to be persuaded to come.&nbsp; I was almost afraid you would
be

<P>hurrying home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently

<P>employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying

<P>to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was

<P>quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.&nbsp; That she was
not

<P>immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;

<P>she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it

<P>without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;

<P>and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,

<P>and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,

<P>the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.

<P>Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;

<P>Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every

<P>proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the

<P>highest promise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ," said Frank Churchill,

<P>with a smile at Emma, "the person has not chosen ill.&nbsp; I heard
a good

<P>deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the

<P>upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party would

<P>particularly prize.&nbsp; I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave

<P>his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.

<P>Do not you think so?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane did not look round.&nbsp; She was not obliged to hear.&nbsp; Mrs.
Weston

<P>had been speaking to her at the same moment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not fair," said Emma, in a whisper; "mine was a random guess.

<P>Do not distress her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little

<P>doubt and very little mercy.&nbsp; Soon afterwards he began again,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure

<P>on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; I dare say they often think of
you,

<P>and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's

<P>coming to hand.&nbsp; Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business

<P>to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be

<P>the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may

<P>have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time,

<P>to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused.&nbsp; She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell," said she, in a voice

<P>of forced calmness, "I can imagine nothing with any confidence.

<P>It must be all conjecture."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes

<P>one conjectures wrong.&nbsp; I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall

<P>make this rivet quite firm.&nbsp; What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse,

<P>when hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen,

<P>I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get

<P>hold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.

<P>There, it is done.&nbsp; I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)

<P>of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape

<P>a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged

<P>Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you are very kind," said he, "it will be one of the waltzes

<P>we danced last night;--let me live them over again.&nbsp; You did not

<P>enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.&nbsp; I believe

<P>you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--

<P>all the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She played.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!--

<P>If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played

<P>something else.&nbsp; He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,

<P>and turning to Emma, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here is something quite new to me.&nbsp; Do you know it?--Cramer.--

<P>And here are a new set of Irish melodies.&nbsp; That, from such a quarter,

<P>one might expect.&nbsp; This was all sent with the instrument.&nbsp;
Very thoughtful

<P>of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have

<P>no music here.&nbsp; I honour that part of the attention particularly;

<P>it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.&nbsp; Nothing
hastily

<P>done; nothing incomplete.&nbsp; True affection only could have prompted
it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;

<P>and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught

<P>the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush

<P>of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,

<P>she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction

<P>with respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax

<P>was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--

<P>Emma took the opportunity of whispering,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You speak too plain.&nbsp; She must understand you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope she does.&nbsp; I would have her understand me.&nbsp; I am not

<P>in the least ashamed of my meaning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up

<P>the idea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me.

<P>I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.&nbsp; Leave shame to
her.

<P>If she does wrong, she ought to feel it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is not entirely without it, I think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not see much sign of it.&nbsp; She is playing Robin Adair

<P>at this moment--his favourite."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window,

<P>descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible,

<P>just to thank him.&nbsp; I will not open the window here; it would give

<P>you all cold; but I can go into my mother's room you know.&nbsp; I dare

<P>say he will come in when he knows who is here.&nbsp; Quite delightful

<P>to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening

<P>the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention,

<P>and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard

<P>by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.&nbsp; So obliged

<P>to you for the carriage last night.&nbsp; We were just in time;

<P>my mother just ready for us.&nbsp; Pray come in; do come in.&nbsp; You
will

<P>find some friends here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard

<P>in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,

<P>but particularly your niece.&nbsp; How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she

<P>caught no cold last night.&nbsp; How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss

<P>Fairfax is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he

<P>would hear her in any thing else.&nbsp; The listeners were amused;

<P>and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.&nbsp; But Emma

<P>still shook her head in steady scepticism.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,"

<P>resumed Miss Bates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He cut her short with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am going to Kingston.&nbsp; Can I do anything for you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day

<P>she wanted something from Kingston."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Cole has servants to send.&nbsp; Can I do any thing for you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I thank you.&nbsp; But do come in.&nbsp; Who do you think is here?--

<P>Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the

<P>new pianoforte.&nbsp; Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said he, in a deliberating manner, "for five minutes, perhaps."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;

<P>so many friends!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, not now, I thank you.&nbsp; I could not stay two minutes.

<P>I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! do come in.&nbsp; They will be so very happy to see you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no; your room is full enough.&nbsp; I will call another day,

<P>and hear the pianoforte."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party

<P>last night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--

<P>Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill;

<P>I never saw any thing equal to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose

<P>Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing

<P>that passes.&nbsp; And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why
Miss

<P>Fairfax should not be mentioned too.&nbsp; I think Miss Fairfax dances

<P>very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player,

<P>without exception, in England.&nbsp; Now, if your friends have any gratitude,

<P>they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return;

<P>but I cannot stay to hear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--

<P>so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is the matter now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To think of your sending us all your store apples.&nbsp; You said you
had

<P>a great many, and now you have not one left.&nbsp; We really are so
shocked!

<P>Mrs. Hodges may well be angry.&nbsp; William Larkins mentioned it here.

<P>You should not have done it, indeed you should not.&nbsp; Ah! he is
off.

<P>He never can bear to be thanked.&nbsp; But I thought he would have staid
now,

<P>and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,

<P>(returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed.

<P>Mr. Knightley cannot stop.&nbsp; He is going to Kingston.&nbsp; He asked
me

<P>if he could do any thing. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Jane, "we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door

<P>was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.

<P>You must have heard every thing to be sure.&nbsp; `Can I do any thing

<P>for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!

<P>Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come--so very

<P>obliging of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already

<P>lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was

<P>perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking

<P>leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young

<P>ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.
