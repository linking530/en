<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Small heart had Harriet for visiting.&nbsp; Only half an hour before
her

<P>friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led

<P>her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to

<P>The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the

<P>operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to

<P>convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,

<P>excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to

<P>be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led

<P>between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every

<P>thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,

<P>was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,

<P>Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity,

<P>which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed

<P>quarter of an hour.&nbsp; She went on herself, to give that portion

<P>of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;

<P>and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay,

<P>and unattended by any alarming young man.&nbsp; She came solitarily

<P>down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,

<P>and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.

<P>She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her

<P>enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it

<P>was creating.&nbsp; She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.

<P>They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing

<P>beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--

<P>till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden,

<P>that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more

<P>interesting subject, and a warmer manner.&nbsp; In that very room

<P>she had been measured last September, with her two friends.

<P>There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by

<P>the window.&nbsp; He had done it.&nbsp; They all seemed to remember
the day,

<P>the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,

<P>the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;

<P>and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma

<P>must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)

<P>when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.&nbsp; The style of

<P>the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.

<P>Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully

<P>passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture

<P>it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally

<P>Harriet must suffer.&nbsp; It was a bad business.&nbsp; She would have
given

<P>a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins

<P>in a higher rank of life.&nbsp; They were so deserving, that a little

<P>higher should have been enough:&nbsp; but as it was, how could she have

<P>done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.&nbsp; They must

<P>be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--

<P>so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity

<P>of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls

<P>to procure it.&nbsp; Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.

<P>The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard

<P>that neither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both

<P>been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away.&nbsp; "And now we

<P>shall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been

<P>so disappointed."&nbsp; And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge

<P>her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--

<P>such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.

<P>Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt

<P>by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.

<P>There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater

<P>pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted

<P>her with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--

<P>glad to see him so well.&nbsp; Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter

<P>this morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--

<P>he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it
would

<P>be so.&nbsp; If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three
days;

<P>I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going

<P>to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.

<P>We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly

<P>as we could wish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the

<P>influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all

<P>was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,

<P>but not less to the purpose.&nbsp; To know that she thought his coming

<P>certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did

<P>she rejoice in their joy.&nbsp; It was a most delightful reanimation

<P>of exhausted spirits.&nbsp; The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness

<P>of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought,

<P>she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,

<P>which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at

<P>his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;

<P>and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield," said he, at the conclusion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,

<P>from his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had better move on, Mr. Weston," said she, "we are detaining

<P>the girls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, I am ready;"--and turning again to Emma, "but you must

<P>not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had my

<P>account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:"--

<P>though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very

<P>different conviction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer

<P>in a manner that appropriated nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,"

<P>was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,

<P>and meant only for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three," was Mr. Weston's

<P>quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.

<P>Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore

<P>a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish

<P>as before.&nbsp; When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder
at

<P>least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet,

<P>she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"--

<P>was a question, however, which did not augur much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,

<P>and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come

<P>in time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's

<P>faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve

<P>o'clock, that she was to think of her at four.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, dear anxious friend,"--said she, in mental soliloquy,

<P>while walking downstairs from her own room, "always overcareful

<P>for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your

<P>little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure

<P>that all is right."&nbsp; The clock struck twelve as she passed through

<P>the hall.&nbsp; "'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four

<P>hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later,

<P>I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.

<P>I am sure they will bring him soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with

<P>her father--Mr. Weston and his son.&nbsp; They had been arrived only

<P>a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation

<P>of Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet

<P>in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when

<P>she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,

<P>was actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did

<P>not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good

<P>looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable,

<P>and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness

<P>of his father's; he looked quick and sensible.&nbsp; She felt immediately

<P>that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner,

<P>and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending

<P>to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had reached Randalls the evening before.&nbsp; She was pleased

<P>with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan,

<P>and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half

<P>a day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I told you yesterday," cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I told

<P>you all that he would be here before the time named.&nbsp; I remembered

<P>what I used to do myself.&nbsp; One cannot creep upon a journey;

<P>one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the

<P>pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins,

<P>is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it," said the young
man,

<P>"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;

<P>but in coming home I felt I might do any thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency.

<P>Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;

<P>the conviction was strengthened by what followed.&nbsp; He was very
much

<P>pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,

<P>would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,

<P>the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,

<P>and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest

<P>in the country which none but one's own country gives, and the

<P>greatest curiosity to visit it.&nbsp; That he should never have been

<P>able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously

<P>through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a

<P>pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.&nbsp; His manner had no air of
study

<P>or exaggeration.&nbsp; He did really look and speak as if in a state
of no

<P>common enjoyment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.

<P>On his side were the inquiries,--"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--

<P>Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps,

<P>afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses

<P>in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance

<P>proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,

<P>while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing

<P>his mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,

<P>so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she

<P>secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,

<P>as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--

<P>and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.

<P>He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be

<P>thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know

<P>very little of the matter.&nbsp; He understood what would be welcome;

<P>he could be sure of little else.&nbsp; "His father's marriage," he said,

<P>"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;

<P>and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must

<P>be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation

<P>on him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,

<P>without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things
it

<P>was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's

<P>character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved

<P>to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object,
he

<P>wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for," said he;

<P>"but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected

<P>more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;

<P>I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,"

<P>said Emma; "were you to guess her to be eighteen, I should listen

<P>with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using

<P>such words.&nbsp; Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her
as

<P>a pretty young woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope I should know better," he replied; "no, depend upon it,

<P>(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should

<P>understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought

<P>extravagant in my terms."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected

<P>from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession

<P>of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were

<P>to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.

<P>She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she

<P>only felt they were agreeable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.

<P>His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them

<P>with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not

<P>to look, she was confident that he was often listening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,

<P>the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration

<P>or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.&nbsp; Happily he

<P>was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--

<P>Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,

<P>he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;

<P>it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons'

<P>understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were

<P>proved against them.&nbsp; She blessed the favouring blindness.

<P>He could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise,

<P>without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest,

<P>give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous

<P>inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey,

<P>through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express

<P>very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped

<P>catching cold--which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite

<P>assured of himself till after another night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--"He must be going.

<P>He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands

<P>for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else."

<P>His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,

<P>saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the

<P>opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,

<P>and therefore may as well be paid now.&nbsp; I have the honour of being

<P>acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady

<P>residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.

<P>I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;

<P>though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather

<P>say Barnes, or Bates.&nbsp; Do you know any family of that name?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure we do," cried his father; "Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--

<P>I saw Miss Bates at the window.&nbsp; True, true, you are acquainted

<P>with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine

<P>girl she is.&nbsp; Call upon her, by all means."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no necessity for my calling this morning," said the

<P>young man; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree

<P>of acquaintance at Weymouth which--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.&nbsp; What is right to be
done

<P>cannot be done too soon.&nbsp; And, besides, I must give you a hint,
Frank;

<P>any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided.

<P>You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body

<P>she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,

<P>who has barely enough to live on.&nbsp; If you do not call early it

<P>will be a slight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The son looked convinced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she is

<P>a very elegant young woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He agreed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as inclined her almost

<P>to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct

<P>sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could

<P>be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,"

<P>said she, "I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;

<P>see her and hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,

<P>for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?"

<P>said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;

<P>"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very

<P>agreeable young lady.&nbsp; She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama

<P>and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.

<P>They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my

<P>servants shall go with you to shew you the way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,

<P>quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses;

<P>you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,

<P>unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you

<P>where you had best cross the street."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,

<P>and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, "My good friend,

<P>this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he

<P>sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown

<P>in a hop, step, and jump."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,

<P>and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.

<P>Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,

<P>and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of

<P>the day, with full confidence in their comfort.
