<P>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball

<P>completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within

<P>the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite

<P>of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible

<P>that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain

<P>a day beyond his fortnight.&nbsp; But this was not judged feasible.

<P>The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly

<P>ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they

<P>must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--

<P>in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.

<P>His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was

<P>not opposed.&nbsp; All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of
one

<P>solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain

<P>of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's

<P>provoking indifference about it.&nbsp; Either because he did not

<P>dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his

<P>being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,

<P>determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording

<P>him any future amusement.&nbsp; To her voluntary communications Emma

<P>could get no more approving reply, than,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well.&nbsp; If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this

<P>trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing

<P>to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--

<P>Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep

<P>as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over

<P>William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.--

<P>Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--

<P>I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,

<P>must be its own reward.&nbsp; Those who are standing by are usually

<P>thinking of something very different."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.

<P>It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was

<P>so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by her feelings

<P>in reprobating the ball, for she enjoyed the thought of it

<P>to an extraordinary degree.&nbsp; It made her animated--open hearted--

<P>she voluntarily said;--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the
ball.

<P>What a disappointment it would be!&nbsp; I do look forward to it, I
own,

<P>with very great pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have

<P>preferred the society of William Larkins.&nbsp; No!--she was more and
more

<P>convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.

<P>There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment

<P>on his side--but no love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.

<P>Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the

<P>over-throw of every thing.&nbsp; A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill

<P>to urge his nephew's instant return.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchill was unwell--

<P>far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering

<P>state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,

<P>though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant

<P>habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;

<P>but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off

<P>for Enscombe without delay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note

<P>from Mrs. Weston, instantly.&nbsp; As to his going, it was inevitable.

<P>He must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real

<P>alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance.&nbsp; He knew her illnesses;

<P>they never occurred but for her own convenience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston added, "that he could only allow himself time to

<P>hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few

<P>friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;

<P>and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.&nbsp; When once

<P>it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament

<P>and exclaim.&nbsp; The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--

<P>and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--

<P>Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!

<P>and she and her partner the happiest!--"I said it would be so,"

<P>was the only consolation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her father's feelings were quite distinct.&nbsp; He thought principally

<P>of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated;

<P>and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;

<P>but they would all be safer at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared;

<P>but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful

<P>look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.

<P>He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.&nbsp; His dejection

<P>was most evident.&nbsp; He sat really lost in thought for the first

<P>few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you will come again," said Emma.&nbsp; "This will not be your only

<P>visit to Randalls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able

<P>to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object

<P>of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town

<P>this spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--

<P>I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our poor ball must be quite given up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the

<P>pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,

<P>foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse,

<P>why are you always so right?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.&nbsp; I would

<P>much rather have been merry than wise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball.&nbsp; My father

<P>depends on it.&nbsp; Do not forget your engagement."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma looked graciously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such a fortnight as it has been!" he continued; "every day more

<P>precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making

<P>me less fit to bear any other place.&nbsp; Happy those, who can remain

<P>at Highbury!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As you do us such ample justice now," said Emma, laughing, "I will

<P>venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?

<P>Do not we rather surpass your expectations?&nbsp; I am sure we do.

<P>I am sure you did not much expect to like us.&nbsp; You would not have
been

<P>so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,

<P>Emma was convinced that it had been so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you must be off this very morning?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; my father is to join me here:&nbsp; we shall walk back together,

<P>and I must be off immediately.&nbsp; I am almost afraid that every moment

<P>will bring him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and

<P>Miss Bates?&nbsp; How unlucky!&nbsp; Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative
mind

<P>might have strengthened yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better.

<P>It was a right thing to do.&nbsp; I went in for three minutes, and was

<P>detained by Miss Bates's being absent.&nbsp; She was out; and I felt
it

<P>impossible not to wait till she came in.&nbsp; She is a woman that one
may,

<P>that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.

<P>It was better to pay my visit, then"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In short," said he, "perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can

<P>hardly be quite without suspicion"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.&nbsp; She hardly

<P>knew what to say.&nbsp; It seemed like the forerunner of something

<P>absolutely serious, which she did not wish.&nbsp; Forcing herself

<P>to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,
then"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was silent.&nbsp; She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting

<P>on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.

<P>She heard him sigh.&nbsp; It was natural for him to feel that he had

<P>cause to sigh.&nbsp; He could not believe her to be encouraging him.

<P>A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more

<P>determined manner said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be

<P>given to Hartfield.&nbsp; My regard for Hartfield is most warm"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--

<P>He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say

<P>how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?

<P>Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made

<P>him composed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.

<P>Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as

<P>incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable,

<P>as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, "It was time to go;"

<P>and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree,

<P>to take leave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall hear about you all," said he; that is my chief consolation.

<P>I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.&nbsp; I have

<P>engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me.&nbsp; She has been so kind
as

<P>to promise it.&nbsp; Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when
one

<P>is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing.

<P>In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest "Good-bye,"

<P>closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.

<P>Short had been the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma

<P>felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little

<P>society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry,

<P>and feeling it too much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a sad change.&nbsp; They had been meeting almost every day

<P>since his arrival.&nbsp; Certainly his being at Randalls had given

<P>great spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea,

<P>the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,

<P>the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!

<P>It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking

<P>from it into the common course of Hartfield days.&nbsp; To complete
every

<P>other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her.

<P>What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,

<P>was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having

<P>a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;

<P>and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that

<P>she must be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous

<P>determination against it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I certainly must," said she.&nbsp; "This sensation of listlessness,

<P>weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,

<P>this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--

<P>I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I

<P>were not--for a few weeks at least.&nbsp; Well! evil to some is always

<P>good to others.&nbsp; I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,

<P>if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.

<P>He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.&nbsp; He could

<P>not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look

<P>would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily,

<P>that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with

<P>considerable kindness added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really

<P>out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her

<P>honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,

<P>her composure was odious.&nbsp; She had been particularly unwell, however,

<P>suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,

<P>that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have

<P>attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming

<P>indifference to the languor of ill-health.
