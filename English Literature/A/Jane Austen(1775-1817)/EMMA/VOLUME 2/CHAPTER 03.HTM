<P>Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment

<P>were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had

<P>seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,

<P>he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on

<P>business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so

<P>openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,

<P>but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.

<P>He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great

<P>pleasure in marking an improvement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A very pleasant evening," he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse

<P>had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,

<P>and the papers swept away;--"particularly pleasant.&nbsp; You and Miss

<P>Fairfax gave us some very good music.&nbsp; I do not know a more

<P>luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained

<P>a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music

<P>and sometimes with conversation.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Fairfax must

<P>have found the evening pleasant, Emma.&nbsp; You left nothing undone.

<P>I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument

<P>at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am happy you approved," said Emma, smiling; "but I hope I am

<P>not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, my dear," said her father instantly; "that I am sure you

<P>are not.&nbsp; There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.

<P>If any thing, you are too attentive.&nbsp; The muffin last night--if
it

<P>had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; "you are not

<P>often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.

<P>I think you understand me, therefore."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An arch look expressed--"I understand you well enough;" but she

<P>said only, "Miss Fairfax is reserved."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome

<P>all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that

<P>has its foundation in diffidence.&nbsp; What arises from discretion

<P>must be honoured."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think her diffident.&nbsp; I do not see it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Emma," said he, moving from his chair into one close

<P>by her, "you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you

<P>had not a pleasant evening."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;

<P>and amused to think how little information I obtained."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am disappointed," was his only answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope every body had a pleasant evening," said Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>in his quiet way.&nbsp; "I had.&nbsp; Once, I felt the fire rather too
much;

<P>but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did

<P>not disturb me.&nbsp; Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,

<P>as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.&nbsp; However,

<P>she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.

<P>I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of

<P>young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.

<P>She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she

<P>had Emma."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for

<P>the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.

<P>I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared

<P>to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!

<P>a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one

<P>can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--

<P>Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them

<P>a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is

<P>not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma,

<P>unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried,

<P>as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,

<P>for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--

<P>do not you think so, my dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish
it.

<P>There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,

<P>and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's right, my dear, very right.&nbsp; I had not thought of it before,

<P>but that is the best way.&nbsp; They must not over-salt the leg; and
then,

<P>if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,

<P>just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a

<P>boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider

<P>it unwholesome."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma," said Mr. Knightley presently, "I have a piece of news for you.

<P>You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think

<P>will interest you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"News!&nbsp; Oh! yes, I always like news.&nbsp; What is it?--why do
you

<P>smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had time only to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls," when the door

<P>was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.

<P>Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to

<P>give quickest.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,

<P>and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?&nbsp; My dear Miss Woodhouse--

<P>I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!

<P>You are too bountiful!&nbsp; Have you heard the news?&nbsp; Mr. Elton
is going

<P>to be married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was

<P>so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,

<P>and a little blush, at the sound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,"

<P>said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction

<P>of some part of what had passed between them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But where could you hear it?" cried Miss Bates.&nbsp; "Where could

<P>you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?&nbsp; For it is not five minutes

<P>since I received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--

<P>or at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready

<P>to come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about

<P>the pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--

<P>for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan

<P>large enough.&nbsp; So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said,

<P>`Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold,

<P>and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh! my dear,'

<P>said I--well, and just then came the note.&nbsp; A Miss Hawkins--

<P>that's all I know.&nbsp; A Miss Hawkins of Bath.&nbsp; But, Mr. Knightley,

<P>how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole

<P>told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.&nbsp; A Miss Hawkins--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.

<P>He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it

<P>to me directly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more

<P>generally interesting.&nbsp; My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.

<P>My mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a

<P>thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We consider our Hartfield pork," replied Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed it

<P>certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I

<P>cannot have a greater pleasure than---"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good

<P>to us.&nbsp; If ever there were people who, without having great wealth

<P>themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.

<P>We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'

<P>Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course."--

<P>Here was a sly glance at Emma.&nbsp; "He had been so fortunate as to--

<P>I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.

<P>The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married

<P>to a Miss Hawkins.&nbsp; By his style, I should imagine it just settled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Elton going to be married!" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.

<P>"He will have every body's wishes for his happiness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is very young to settle," was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.

<P>"He had better not be in a hurry.&nbsp; He seemed to me very well off

<P>as he was.&nbsp; We were always glad to see him at Hartfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!" said Miss Bates,

<P>joyfully; "my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot

<P>bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.

<P>This is great news, indeed.&nbsp; Jane, you have never seen

<P>Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly

<P>to occupy her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton," she replied, starting on this appeal;

<P>"is he--is he a tall man?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who shall answer that question?" cried Emma.&nbsp; "My father would

<P>say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is

<P>just the happy medium.&nbsp; When you have been here a little longer,

<P>Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard

<P>of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.&nbsp; He is the very best

<P>young man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday

<P>he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.&nbsp; Miss Hawkins,--I dare
say,

<P>an excellent young woman.&nbsp; His extreme attention to my mother--

<P>wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better,

<P>for my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she

<P>does not hear quite quick.&nbsp; Jane says that Colonel Campbell is
a

<P>little deaf.&nbsp; He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm
bath--

<P>but she says it did him no lasting benefit.&nbsp; Colonel Campbell,

<P>you know, is quite our angel.&nbsp; And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming

<P>young man, quite worthy of him.&nbsp; It is such a happiness when good

<P>people get together--and they always do.&nbsp; Now, here will be Mr.
Elton

<P>and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;

<P>and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple

<P>than Mr. and Mrs. Perry.&nbsp; I say, sir," turning to Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>"I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.

<P>I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir,

<P>if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--

<P>a roast loin of pork--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been

<P>acquainted with her," said Emma, "nothing I suppose can be known.

<P>One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.&nbsp; He has been

<P>gone only four weeks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,

<P>Emma said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take

<P>an interest in this news.&nbsp; You, who have been hearing and seeing

<P>so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep

<P>in the business on Miss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse

<P>your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When I have seen Mr. Elton," replied Jane, " I dare say I

<P>shall be interested--but I believe it requires that with me.

<P>And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression

<P>may be a little worn off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,"

<P>said Miss Bates, "four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had

<P>always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts;

<P>not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said,

<P>`No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do

<P>not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries.

<P>I do not pretend to it.&nbsp; What is before me, I see.&nbsp; At the
same time,

<P>nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse

<P>lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not

<P>offend for the world.&nbsp; How does Miss Smith do?&nbsp; She seems
quite

<P>recovered now.&nbsp; Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?

<P>Oh! those dear little children.&nbsp; Jane, do you know I always fancy

<P>Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.&nbsp; I mean in person--tall, and
with

<P>that sort of look--and not very talkative."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.

<P>One takes up a notion, and runs away with it.&nbsp; Mr. Dixon, you say,

<P>is not, strictly speaking, handsome?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Handsome!&nbsp; Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.&nbsp; I told
you he

<P>was plain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,

<P>and that you yourself--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.&nbsp; Where I have a regard,

<P>I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed

<P>the general opinion, when I called him plain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.

<P>The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.

<P>You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must

<P>take leave.&nbsp; This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed.

<P>I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes:

<P>and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you

<P>out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already.

<P>Thank you, we do indeed.&nbsp; I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,

<P>for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork:

<P>when we dress the leg it will be another thing.&nbsp; Good morning to
you,

<P>my dear sir.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley is coming too.&nbsp; Well,
that is

<P>so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to

<P>give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning

<P>to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him

<P>while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--

<P>and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give

<P>to her own view of the subject.&nbsp; It was to herself an amusing

<P>and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton

<P>could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet:

<P>Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving

<P>the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly

<P>from others.&nbsp; It was now about the time that she was likely to
call.

<P>If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning

<P>to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be

<P>detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would

<P>undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,

<P>when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which

<P>hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the

<P>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!" which instantly

<P>burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.

<P>As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater

<P>kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly

<P>through what she had to tell.&nbsp; "She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's

<P>half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been

<P>afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might

<P>get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;

<P>but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman

<P>was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step

<P>in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay

<P>half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,

<P>and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast

<P>as she could, and took shelter at Ford's."--Ford's was the principal

<P>woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united;

<P>the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--"And so,

<P>there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,

<P>full ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--

<P>to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--

<P>who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--

<P>Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think.&nbsp; I thought I should have fainted.

<P>I did not know what to do.&nbsp; I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth
saw

<P>me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.

<P>I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took

<P>no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;

<P>and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!

<P>I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.&nbsp; I could not go
away

<P>you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere

<P>in the world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last,

<P>I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going

<P>on with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.

<P>I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking

<P>that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,

<P>Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came quite up

<P>to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,

<P>if I would.&nbsp; She did not do any of it in the same way that she
used;

<P>I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to try to be

<P>very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time;

<P>but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember

<P>she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost

<P>too kind!&nbsp; Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!

<P>By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined

<P>that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--

<P>I found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as

<P>if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,

<P>and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,

<P>you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it

<P>did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got

<P>three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,

<P>if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round

<P>by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated

<P>by this rain.&nbsp; Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death
of me!

<P>So I said, I was very much obliged to him:&nbsp; you know I could

<P>not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round

<P>by the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,

<P>or any thing about it.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, I would rather
done

<P>any thing than have it happen:&nbsp; and yet, you know, there was a
sort

<P>of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.

<P>And Elizabeth, too.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and
make

<P>me comfortable again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in

<P>her power.&nbsp; She was obliged to stop and think.&nbsp; She was not
thoroughly

<P>comfortable herself.&nbsp; The young man's conduct, and his sister's,

<P>seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.

<P>As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture

<P>of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.

<P>But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before;

<P>and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?

<P>It was folly to be disturbed by it.&nbsp; Of course, he must be sorry

<P>to lose her--they must be all sorry.&nbsp; Ambition, as well as love,

<P>had probably been mortified.&nbsp; They might all have hoped to rise

<P>by Harriet's acquaintance:&nbsp; and besides, what was the value of

<P>Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--

<P>what signified her praise?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable,

<P>by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite

<P>unworthy of being dwelt on,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It might be distressing, for the moment," said she; "but you seem

<P>to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--

<P>can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need

<P>not think about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Harriet said, "very true," and she "would not think about it;"

<P>but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;

<P>and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head,

<P>was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give

<P>with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether

<P>to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state

<P>of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance

<P>with her!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived.&nbsp; Though she did
not

<P>feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before,

<P>or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their

<P>first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the

<P>sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure,

<P>as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place

<P>the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.

<P>It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining

<P>any influence to alarm.&nbsp; As Harriet now lived, the Martins could

<P>not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted

<P>either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her

<P>refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's;

<P>and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again,

<P>with any necessity, or even any power of speech.
