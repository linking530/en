<P>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's

<P>dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston

<P>was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,

<P>to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with

<P>a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed

<P>of what he had done.&nbsp; He had no reason to wish his hair longer,

<P>to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,

<P>to improve his spirits.&nbsp; He was quite as undaunted and as lively

<P>as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things

<P>do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an

<P>impudent way.&nbsp; Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not

<P>always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.

<P>Mr. Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man.&nbsp; If he were,

<P>he would have done this differently.&nbsp; He would either have gloried

<P>in the achievement, or been ashamed of it.&nbsp; There would have been

<P>either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too

<P>weak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he

<P>is not trifling or silly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,

<P>and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,

<P>and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;

<P>of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness

<P>into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those

<P>might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at

<P>Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings

<P>of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed

<P>her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as

<P>Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty,

<P>before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as

<P>they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly

<P>noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all

<P>the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake

<P>and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his

<P>care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise

<P>during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;

<P>she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased

<P>to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping

<P>no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health,

<P>activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get

<P>about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became

<P>the owner of Donwell Abbey.&nbsp; She had an opportunity now of speaking

<P>her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her
out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is coming as you should do," said she; "like a gentleman.--

<P>I am quite glad to see you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He thanked her, observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at the same

<P>moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether

<P>you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--

<P>You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes I should, I am sure I should.&nbsp; There is always a look of

<P>consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know

<P>to be beneath them.&nbsp; You think you carry it off very well, I dare
say,

<P>but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern;

<P>I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.

<P>Now you have nothing to try for.&nbsp; You are not afraid of being

<P>supposed ashamed.&nbsp; You are not striving to look taller than any

<P>body else.&nbsp; Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same

<P>room with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nonsensical girl!" was his reply, but not at all in anger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party

<P>as with Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; She was received with a cordial respect

<P>which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could

<P>wish for.&nbsp; When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,

<P>the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;

<P>the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked

<P>her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated

<P>by her--and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity

<P>on his side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper

<P>unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of

<P>naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,

<P>the lawyer of Highbury.&nbsp; The less worthy females were to come

<P>in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith;

<P>but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject

<P>of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton

<P>were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to

<P>the pleasantness of her neighbour.&nbsp; The first remote sound to which

<P>she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.

<P>Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to
be

<P>very interesting.&nbsp; She listened, and found it well worth listening
to.

<P>That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.

<P>Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates,

<P>and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight

<P>of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand,

<P>but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story,

<P>the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,

<P>and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was,

<P>that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before,

<P>to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;

<P>that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at

<P>a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--

<P>but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only

<P>one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One can suppose nothing else," added Mrs. Cole, "and I was only

<P>surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.&nbsp; But Jane,

<P>it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said

<P>about it.&nbsp; She knows their ways best; but I should not consider
their

<P>silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.

<P>They might chuse to surprize her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the

<P>subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,

<P>and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there

<P>were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way,

<P>and still listen to Mrs. Cole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given

<P>me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,

<P>who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.

<P>It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses

<P>there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.

<P>This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was

<P>but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed

<P>to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I

<P>do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are

<P>but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;

<P>and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not

<P>any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest

<P>old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this

<P>to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he

<P>is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging

<P>himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might

<P>be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;

<P>and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--

<P>or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great

<P>hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing

<P>more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,

<P>turned to Frank Churchill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why do you smile?" said she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, why do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being

<P>so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I rather wonder that it was never made before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--

<P>which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large

<P>for Mrs. Bates's house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You may say what you chuse--but your countenance testifies

<P>that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; I rather believe you are giving me more credit
for

<P>acuteness than I deserve.&nbsp; I smile because you smile, and shall
probably

<P>suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what

<P>there is to question.&nbsp; If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who
can be?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed.&nbsp; I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.

<P>She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument

<P>would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,

<P>is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It

<P>is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.&nbsp; I told you that your suspicions would

<P>guide mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon

<P>in them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Dixon.--Very well.&nbsp; Yes, I immediately perceive that it must

<P>be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.&nbsp; We were speaking the

<P>other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I

<P>had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good

<P>intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help

<P>suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,

<P>he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became

<P>conscious of a little attachment on her side.&nbsp; One might guess

<P>twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure

<P>there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury

<P>instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.&nbsp; Here, she must
be

<P>leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been

<P>all enjoyment.&nbsp; As to the pretence of trying her native air, I
look

<P>upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed;

<P>but what can any body's native air do for them in the months

<P>of January, February, and March?&nbsp; Good fires and carriages would

<P>be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I

<P>dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,

<P>though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly

<P>tell you what they are."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.

<P>Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer

<P>for being very decided."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then, he saved her life.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of that?--

<P>A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.

<P>He caught her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He did.&nbsp; I was there--one of the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,

<P>for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think

<P>I should have made some discoveries."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,

<P>that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon

<P>caught her.--It was the work of a moment.&nbsp; And though the consequent

<P>shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I

<P>believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--

<P>yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar

<P>anxiety to be observable.&nbsp; I do not mean to say, however, that
you

<P>might not have made discoveries."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The conversation was here interrupted.&nbsp; They were called on to
share

<P>in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,

<P>and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when

<P>the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed

<P>exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,

<P>Emma said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.&nbsp; I wanted
to know

<P>a little more, and this tells me quite enough.&nbsp; Depend upon it,

<P>we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we

<P>must conclude it to come from the Campbells."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax knows
it

<P>is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.

<P>She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.

<P>I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced

<P>myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.&nbsp; Your reasonings

<P>carry my judgment along with them entirely.&nbsp; At first, while I

<P>supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw

<P>it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing

<P>in the world.&nbsp; But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much
more

<P>probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.

<P>And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no occasion to press the matter farther.&nbsp; The conviction

<P>seemed real; he looked as if he felt it.&nbsp; She said no more,

<P>other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away;

<P>the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked

<P>to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever

<P>things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion

<P>neither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks,

<P>dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,

<P>in their different divisions, arrived.&nbsp; Emma watched the entree
of her

<P>own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity

<P>and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the

<P>artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,

<P>unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations

<P>of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.

<P>There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had

<P>been lately shedding?&nbsp; To be in company, nicely dressed herself

<P>and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty,

<P>and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.

<P>Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she

<P>might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad

<P>to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having

<P>loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous

<P>pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.

<P>She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much

<P>in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity

<P>or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance;

<P>but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced,

<P>and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations

<P>were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "my

<P>excellent friend Colonel Campbell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested

<P>by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her

<P>perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask

<P>and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious

<P>of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she

<P>plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of
the

<P>early was Frank Churchill.&nbsp; In he walked, the first and the handsomest;

<P>and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and

<P>her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,

<P>where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,

<P>would not sit at all.&nbsp; Emma divined what every body present must

<P>be thinking.&nbsp; She was his object, and every body must perceive
it.

<P>She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient

<P>moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.&nbsp; "He
had

<P>never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete."

<P>And she, "Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,

<P>but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton."

<P>Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first

<P>glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.

<P>He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--

<P>hated sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--

<P>that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left

<P>very busy over parish business--that as long as he had staid,

<P>however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general

<P>a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of

<P>Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--

<P>that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place

<P>rather too much.&nbsp; She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--

<P>the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;

<P>and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe

<P>was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings

<P>were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even

<P>when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even

<P>chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;

<P>that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that,

<P>though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,

<P>without considerable address at times, that he could get away,

<P>or introduce an acquaintance for a night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,

<P>taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more

<P>retirement at home than he liked.&nbsp; His importance at Enscombe was

<P>very evident.&nbsp; He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,

<P>that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,

<P>and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting

<P>one or two points) he could with time persuade her to any thing.

<P>One of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.

<P>He had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed

<P>to be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.&nbsp; This had

<P>happened the year before.&nbsp; Now, he said, he was beginning to have

<P>no longer the same wish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed

<P>to be good behaviour to his father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have made a most wretched discovery," said he, after a short pause.--

<P>"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.&nbsp; I never knew

<P>days fly so fast.&nbsp; A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to

<P>enjoy myself.&nbsp; But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--

<P>I hate the recollection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day,

<P>out of so few, in having your hair cut."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said he, smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all.

<P>I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself

<P>fit to be seen."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself

<P>obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.

<P>When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored

<P>as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room

<P>at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is the matter?" said she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He started.&nbsp; "Thank you for rousing me," he replied.&nbsp; "I believe

<P>I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair

<P>in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes

<P>from her.&nbsp; I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This
must

<P>be a fancy of her own.&nbsp; I see nobody else looking like her!--

<P>I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.&nbsp; Shall I?--

<P>Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;--

<P>whether she colours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss

<P>Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,

<P>as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly

<P>in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:--"one can get

<P>near every body, and say every thing.&nbsp; My dear Emma, I am longing

<P>to talk to you.&nbsp; I have been making discoveries and forming plans,

<P>just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.

<P>Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How?--They were invited, were not they?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They walked, I conclude.&nbsp; How else could they come?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad

<P>it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night,

<P>and cold as the nights are now.&nbsp; And as I looked at her, though
I

<P>never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she

<P>was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.

<P>Poor girl!&nbsp; I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr.
Weston

<P>came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about

<P>the carriage.&nbsp; You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;

<P>and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates,

<P>to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took

<P>us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.

<P>Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.

<P>`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,

<P>many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's

<P>carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.'&nbsp; I was

<P>quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.

<P>Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--

<P>the sort of thing that so few men would think of.&nbsp; And, in short,

<P>from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think

<P>that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.

<P>I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself,

<P>and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very likely," said Emma--"nothing more likely.&nbsp; I know no man

<P>more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any

<P>thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.

<P>He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,

<P>considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case

<P>of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,

<P>there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.

<P>I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed
at

<P>him about it, but he said not a word that could betray."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give him credit for

<P>more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;

<P>for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head,

<P>and I have never been able to get it out again.&nbsp; The more I think

<P>of it, the more probable it appears.&nbsp; In short, I have made a match

<P>between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; See the consequence

<P>of keeping you company!--What do you say to it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!" exclaimed Emma.&nbsp; "Dear Mrs. Weston,

<P>how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley

<P>must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--

<P>Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.&nbsp; I cannot at all consent to

<P>Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.

<P>I am amazed that you should think of such a thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.

<P>I do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--

<P>but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley

<P>really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's

<P>account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I would.&nbsp; I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--

<P>Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I

<P>cannot adopt it now.&nbsp; And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you

<P>very well know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But the imprudence of such a match!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation

<P>than what you mention.&nbsp; His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell
you,

<P>would be quite enough to account for the horses.&nbsp; He has a great

<P>regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--

<P>and is always glad to shew them attention.&nbsp; My dear Mrs. Weston,

<P>do not take to match-making.&nbsp; You do it very ill.&nbsp; Jane Fairfax
mistress

<P>of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.&nbsp; For his own
sake,

<P>I would not have him do so mad a thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.&nbsp; Excepting inequality of
fortune,

<P>and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.&nbsp; I am sure he has not
the

<P>least idea of it.&nbsp; Do not put it into his head.&nbsp; Why should
he marry?--

<P>He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,

<P>and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely

<P>fond of his brother's children.&nbsp; He has no occasion to marry,

<P>either to fill up his time or his heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really

<P>loves Jane Fairfax--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nonsense!&nbsp; He does not care about Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; In the way

<P>of love, I am sure he does not.&nbsp; He would do any good to her,

<P>or her family; but--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good he

<P>could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;

<P>a very shameful and degrading connexion.&nbsp; How would he bear to
have

<P>Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey,

<P>and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--

<P>`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very

<P>kind neighbour!'&nbsp; And then fly off, through half a sentence,

<P>to her mother's old petticoat.&nbsp; `Not that it was such a very old

<P>petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed,

<P>she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For shame, Emma!&nbsp; Do not mimic her.&nbsp; You divert me against

<P>my conscience.&nbsp; And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley
would

<P>be much disturbed by Miss Bates.&nbsp; Little things do not irritate
him.

<P>She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would

<P>only talk louder, and drown her voice.&nbsp; But the question is not,

<P>whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it;

<P>and I think he does.&nbsp; I have heard him speak, and so must you,

<P>so very highly of Jane Fairfax!&nbsp; The interest he takes in her--

<P>his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no

<P>happier prospect!&nbsp; I have heard him express himself so warmly on

<P>those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,

<P>and of her voice!&nbsp; I have heard him say that he could listen to
her

<P>for ever.&nbsp; Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred

<P>to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--

<P>though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present

<P>from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?&nbsp; I cannot

<P>help suspecting him.&nbsp; I think he is just the person to do it,

<P>even without being in love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.

<P>But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.

<P>Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;

<P>oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common

<P>course of things, occur to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have

<P>told her so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.&nbsp; I have a very

<P>strong notion that it comes from him.&nbsp; I am sure he was particularly

<P>silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have

<P>many a time reproached me with doing.&nbsp; I see no sign of attachment--

<P>I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince

<P>me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather

<P>gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was

<P>the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room

<P>shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--

<P>and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse

<P>would do them the honour of trying it.&nbsp; Frank Churchill, of whom,

<P>in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been

<P>seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax,

<P>followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as,

<P>in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very

<P>proper compliance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt

<P>more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste

<P>nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,

<P>and could accompany her own voice well.&nbsp; One accompaniment to her
song

<P>took her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly

<P>taken by Frank Churchill.&nbsp; Her pardon was duly begged at the close

<P>of the song, and every thing usual followed.&nbsp; He was accused

<P>of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;

<P>which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,

<P>and had no voice at all, roundly asserted.&nbsp; They sang together

<P>once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax,

<P>whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could

<P>attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the

<P>numbers round the instrument, to listen.&nbsp; Frank Churchill sang
again.

<P>They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.

<P>But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew

<P>away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking

<P>on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet

<P>sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.

<P>Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.

<P>She could see nothing but evil in it.&nbsp; It would be a great

<P>disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.

<P>A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,

<P>and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her

<P>father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could not at all

<P>endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.&nbsp; A Mrs. Knightley

<P>for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry.

<P>Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.

<P>They talked at first only of the performance.&nbsp; His admiration

<P>was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,

<P>it would not have struck her.&nbsp; As a sort of touchstone, however,

<P>she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece;

<P>and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,

<P>she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any

<P>kindness of his own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I often feel concern," said she, "that I dare not make our carriage

<P>more useful on such occasions.&nbsp; It is not that I am without the
wish;

<P>but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James

<P>should put-to for such a purpose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," he replied;--

<P>"but you must often wish it, I am sure."&nbsp; And he smiled with such

<P>seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This present from the Campbells," said she--"this pianoforte

<P>is very kindly given."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--

<P>"But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.

<P>Surprizes are foolish things.&nbsp; The pleasure is not enhanced, and
the

<P>inconvenience is often considerable.&nbsp; I should have expected better

<P>judgment in Colonel Campbell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley

<P>had had no concern in giving the instrument.&nbsp; But whether he

<P>were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there

<P>were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.

<P>Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That will do," said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--

<P>"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another song, however, was soon begged for.&nbsp; "One more;--they would

<P>not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for

<P>one more."&nbsp; And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you
could

<P>manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.

<P>The strength of the song falls on the second."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Knightley grew angry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That fellow," said he, indignantly, "thinks of nothing but shewing

<P>off his own voice.&nbsp; This must not be."&nbsp; And touching Miss
Bates,

<P>who at that moment passed near--"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let

<P>your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?&nbsp; Go, and interfere.

<P>They have no mercy on her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even

<P>to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all

<P>farther singing.&nbsp; Here ceased the concert part of the evening,

<P>for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers;

<P>but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--

<P>originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted

<P>by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,

<P>to give proper space.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,

<P>was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill,

<P>coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand,

<P>and led her up to the top.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,

<P>Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her

<P>voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.

<P>This would be a trial.&nbsp; He was no dancer in general.&nbsp; If he
were to be

<P>very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.

<P>There was no immediate appearance.&nbsp; No; he was talking to Mrs.
Cole--

<P>he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,

<P>and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;

<P>and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.

<P>Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the

<P>suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well

<P>matched in a partner.&nbsp; They were a couple worth looking at.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.

<P>It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home,

<P>on her mother's account.&nbsp; After some attempts, therefore, to be

<P>permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,

<P>look sorrowful, and have done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps it is as well," said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma

<P>to her carriage.&nbsp; "I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid

<P>dancing would not have agreed with me, after your's."
