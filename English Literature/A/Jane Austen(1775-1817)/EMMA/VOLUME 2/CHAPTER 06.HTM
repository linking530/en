<P>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.&nbsp; He came with

<P>Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.

<P>He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,

<P>till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse

<P>their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--"He did not doubt there

<P>being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him,

<P>he should always chuse the same.&nbsp; Highbury, that airy, cheerful,

<P>happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction."--

<P>Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to

<P>its bearing the same construction with him.&nbsp; They walked thither
directly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma had hardly expected them:&nbsp; for Mr. Weston, who had called
in

<P>for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,

<P>knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize

<P>to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,

<P>arm in arm.&nbsp; She was wanting to see him again, and especially

<P>to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom

<P>her opinion of him was to depend.&nbsp; If he were deficient there,

<P>nothing should make amends for it.&nbsp; But on seeing them together,

<P>she became perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; It was not merely in fine words

<P>or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be

<P>more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could

<P>more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and

<P>securing her affection.&nbsp; And there was time enough for Emma to
form a

<P>reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.

<P>They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--

<P>first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.

<P>He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently

<P>for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,

<P>confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,

<P>and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma

<P>could have supposed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.

<P>He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,

<P>and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting

<P>that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest

<P>of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though

<P>in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit,

<P>they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general,

<P>which must be very like a merit to those he was with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,

<P>it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily

<P>absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making

<P>a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly

<P>had not done him justice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,

<P>though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of

<P>post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood

<P>than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected

<P>to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they

<P>gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built

<P>many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been

<P>in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used

<P>as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the

<P>highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist

<P>club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.

<P>He was immediately interested.&nbsp; Its character as a ball-room caught
him;

<P>and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two

<P>superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate

<P>its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should

<P>have ceased.&nbsp; He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge

<P>none which they suggested.&nbsp; No, it was long enough, broad enough,

<P>handsome enough.&nbsp; It would hold the very number for comfort.

<P>They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through

<P>the winter.&nbsp; Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good

<P>old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!

<P>The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction

<P>that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be

<P>tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.

<P>He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw

<P>around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting;

<P>and even when particulars were given and families described, he was

<P>still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture

<P>would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty

<P>in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.

<P>He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma

<P>was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail

<P>so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.&nbsp; He seemed to
have

<P>all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations

<P>of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.

<P>Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference

<P>to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.

<P>He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.

<P>It was but an effusion of lively spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;

<P>and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,

<P>Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him

<P>if he had paid it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, oh! yes"--he replied; "I was just going to mention it.

<P>A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very

<P>much obliged to you for your preparatory hint.&nbsp; If the talking
aunt

<P>had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.

<P>As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.

<P>Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that

<P>was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home

<P>before him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my

<P>utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)

<P>joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them

<P>very nearly three-quarters of an hour.&nbsp; The good lady had not given
me

<P>the possibility of escape before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look
ill.

<P>But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?

<P>Ladies can never look ill.&nbsp; And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally

<P>so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--

<P>A most deplorable want of complexion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss

<P>Fairfax's complexion.&nbsp; "It was certainly never brilliant, but she

<P>would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was

<P>a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance

<P>to the character of her face."&nbsp; He listened with all due deference;

<P>acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he

<P>must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want

<P>of the fine glow of health.&nbsp; Where features were indifferent,

<P>a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,

<P>the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the

<P>effect was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste.--At least

<P>you admire her except her complexion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shook his head and laughed.--"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax

<P>and her complexion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you see her often at Weymouth?&nbsp; Were you often in the same
society?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,

<P>"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day

<P>of their lives, as my father informs me.&nbsp; He comes to Highbury
himself,

<P>he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.

<P>If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove

<P>myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.

<P>I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--

<P>I dare say they sell gloves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.&nbsp; I do admire your patriotism.

<P>You will be adored in Highbury.&nbsp; You were very popular before you
came,

<P>because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at

<P>Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of "Men's Beavers"

<P>and "York Tan" were bringing down and displaying on the counter,

<P>he said--"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking

<P>to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst

<P>of my amor patriae.&nbsp; Do not let me lose it.&nbsp; I assure you
the utmost

<P>stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any

<P>happiness in private life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax

<P>and her party at Weymouth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be
a

<P>very unfair one.&nbsp; It is always the lady's right to decide on the
degree

<P>of acquaintance.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--

<P>I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.

<P>But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,

<P>she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least

<P>information about any body, that I really think you may say what you

<P>like of your acquaintance with her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me

<P>so well.&nbsp; I met her frequently at Weymouth.&nbsp; I had known the
Campbells

<P>a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.

<P>Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,

<P>warm-hearted woman.&nbsp; I like them all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she

<P>is destined to be?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston smiling;

<P>"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows

<P>what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life.

<P>I will move a little farther off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I certainly do forget to think of her," said Emma, "as having ever

<P>been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,

<P>"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?"

<P>said Frank Churchill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ever hear her!" repeated Emma.&nbsp; "You forget how much she belongs

<P>to Highbury.&nbsp; I have heard her every year of our lives since we

<P>both began.&nbsp; She plays charmingly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who

<P>could really judge.&nbsp; She appeared to me to play well, that is,

<P>with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--

<P>I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill

<P>or right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used

<P>to hear her's admired; and I remember one proof of her being

<P>thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love

<P>with another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--

<P>would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument,

<P>if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed

<P>to like to hear one if he could hear the other.&nbsp; That, I thought,

<P>in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Proof indeed!" said Emma, highly amused.--"Mr. Dixon is very musical,

<P>is he?&nbsp; We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from
you,

<P>than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought

<P>it a very strong proof."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal

<P>stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all

<P>agreeable to me.&nbsp; I could not excuse a man's having more music

<P>than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine

<P>sounds than to my feelings.&nbsp; How did Miss Campbell appear to like
it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was her very particular friend, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor comfort!" said Emma, laughing.&nbsp; "One would rather have a
stranger

<P>preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might

<P>not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend

<P>always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--

<P>Poor Mrs. Dixon!&nbsp; Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are right.&nbsp; It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;

<P>but she really did not seem to feel it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which.

<P>But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship,

<P>or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have

<P>felt it:&nbsp; Miss Fairfax herself.&nbsp; She must have felt the improper

<P>and dangerous distinction."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As to that--I do not--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's

<P>sensations from you, or from any body else.&nbsp; They are known to
no

<P>human being, I guess, but herself.&nbsp; But if she continued to play

<P>whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--"

<P>he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, "however, it

<P>is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--

<P>how it might all be behind the scenes.&nbsp; I can only say that there

<P>was smoothness outwardly.&nbsp; But you, who have known Miss Fairfax
from

<P>a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she

<P>is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children

<P>and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should

<P>be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever

<P>she visited her friends.&nbsp; But we never did.&nbsp; I hardly know
how it

<P>has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side

<P>which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized

<P>and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother,

<P>and all their set.&nbsp; And then, her reserve--I never could attach

<P>myself to any one so completely reserved."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed," said he.&nbsp; "Oftentimes

<P>very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.&nbsp; There is safety

<P>in reserve, but no attraction.&nbsp; One cannot love a reserved person."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction

<P>may be the greater.&nbsp; But I must be more in want of a friend,

<P>or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take

<P>the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.

<P>Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.

<P>I have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that

<P>such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,

<P>such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt

<P>to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He perfectly agreed with her:&nbsp; and after walking together so long,

<P>and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with
him,

<P>that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.

<P>He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the

<P>world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune,

<P>therefore better than she had expected.&nbsp; His ideas seemed more
moderate--

<P>his feelings warmer.&nbsp; She was particularly struck by his manner

<P>of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church,

<P>he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much

<P>fault with.&nbsp; No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such
a house

<P>as a man was to be pitied for having.&nbsp; If it were to be shared
with

<P>the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having

<P>that house.&nbsp; There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.

<P>The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.

<P>Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many

<P>advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could

<P>be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.

<P>But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he did know what he

<P>was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination

<P>to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.

<P>He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be

<P>occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry,

<P>but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make

<P>him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly

<P>give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.
