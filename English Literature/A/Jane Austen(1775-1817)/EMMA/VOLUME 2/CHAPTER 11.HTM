<P>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely.&nbsp; Instances have

<P>been known of young people passing many, many months successively,

<P>without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury

<P>accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--

<P>when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly,

<P>felt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;

<P>and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded

<P>to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young

<P>people in schemes on the subject.&nbsp; Frank's was the first idea;

<P>and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best

<P>judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation

<P>and appearance.&nbsp; But still she had inclination enough for shewing

<P>people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss

<P>Woodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare

<P>herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,

<P>without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first

<P>in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made

<P>to hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour,

<P>in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could

<P>say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's

<P>should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,

<P>and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.

<P>Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,

<P>and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they

<P>could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed,

<P>of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the

<P>indispensable division of space to every couple.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two

<P>Miss Coxes five," had been repeated many times over.&nbsp; "And there

<P>will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself,

<P>besides Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.

<P>You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss

<P>Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But soon it came to be on one side,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think

<P>there will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On another,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth

<P>while to stand up.&nbsp; Five couple are nothing, when one thinks

<P>seriously about it.&nbsp; It will not do to invite five couple.

<P>It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother's,

<P>and must be invited with the rest.&nbsp; Somebody else believed

<P>Mrs. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had

<P>been asked.&nbsp; A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last,

<P>Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included,

<P>and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out,

<P>it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten,

<P>and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they

<P>could be disposed of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.

<P>"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?"

<P>It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that

<P>many of them wanted a better.&nbsp; Emma said it would be awkward;

<P>Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse

<P>opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.&nbsp; It made him so

<P>very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence.

<P>I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.&nbsp; She would

<P>catch a dreadful cold.&nbsp; So would poor little Harriet.

<P>So you would all.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up;

<P>do not let them talk of such a wild thing.&nbsp; Pray do not let them

<P>talk of it.&nbsp; That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.

<P>Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.

<P>He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping

<P>them open very inconsiderately.&nbsp; He does not think of the draught.

<P>I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite

<P>the thing!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.&nbsp; She knew the importance

<P>of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.&nbsp; Every
door

<P>was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme

<P>of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;

<P>and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space

<P>which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient

<P>for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough

<P>for ten.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were too magnificent," said he.&nbsp; "We allowed unnecessary room.

<P>Ten couple may stand here very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma demurred.&nbsp; "It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could

<P>be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true," he gravely replied; "it was very bad."&nbsp; But still
he

<P>went on measuring, and still he ended with,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no," said she, "you are quite unreasonable.&nbsp; It would be dreadful

<P>to be standing so close!&nbsp; Nothing can be farther from pleasure

<P>than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no denying it," he replied.&nbsp; "I agree with you exactly.

<P>A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving

<P>pictures in a few words.&nbsp; Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,

<P>having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.

<P>It would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do

<P>not know that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand

<P>here very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little

<P>self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure

<P>of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave

<P>the rest.&nbsp; Had she intended ever to marry him, it might have been

<P>worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value

<P>of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for

<P>all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered

<P>the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance

<P>of the scheme.&nbsp; It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," he almost immediately began, "your inclination

<P>for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the

<P>terrors of my father's little rooms.&nbsp; I bring a new proposal

<P>on the subject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your

<P>approbation to be acted upon.&nbsp; May I hope for the honour of your

<P>hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,

<P>to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Crown!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,

<P>my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.

<P>Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful

<P>welcome than at Randalls.&nbsp; It is his own idea.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston
sees

<P>no objection to it, provided you are satisfied.&nbsp; This is what we

<P>all feel.&nbsp; Oh! you were perfectly right!&nbsp; Ten couple, in either
of

<P>the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt

<P>how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing

<P>any thing to like to yield.&nbsp; Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--

<P>I hope you consent?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and

<P>Mrs. Weston do not.&nbsp; I think it admirable; and, as far as I can

<P>answer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement

<P>that could be.&nbsp; Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully

<P>comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations

<P>were necessary to make it acceptable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--

<P>much worse than the other.&nbsp; A room at an inn was always damp

<P>and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.

<P>If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.&nbsp; He had
never

<P>been in the room at the Crown in his life--did not know the people

<P>who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan.&nbsp; They would catch

<P>worse colds at the Crown than anywhere."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was going to observe, sir," said Frank Churchill,

<P>"that one of the great recommendations of this change would

<P>be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--

<P>so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!&nbsp; Mr. Perry

<P>might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sir," said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very much

<P>mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.

<P>Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.&nbsp; But I

<P>do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you

<P>than your father's house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.&nbsp; We shall
have

<P>no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening;

<P>and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold

<P>air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think

<P>of opening the windows at Randalls.&nbsp; Nobody could be so imprudent!

<P>I never heard of such a thing.&nbsp; Dancing with open windows!--I am
sure,

<P>neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)

<P>would suffer it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind

<P>a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.

<P>I have often known it done myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!&nbsp; I never could have supposed
it.

<P>But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.

<P>However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come

<P>to talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal

<P>of consideration.&nbsp; One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.

<P>If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,

<P>we may talk it over, and see what can be done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for talking

<P>every thing over.&nbsp; There is no hurry at all.&nbsp; If it can be
contrived

<P>to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.

<P>They will be so near their own stable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So they will, my dear.&nbsp; That is a great thing.&nbsp; Not that
James

<P>ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.

<P>If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is

<P>Mrs. Stokes to be trusted?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; I do not know her,

<P>even by sight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will

<P>be under Mrs. Weston's care.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct

<P>the whole."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,

<P>who is carefulness itself.&nbsp; Do not you remember what Mr. Perry
said,

<P>so many years ago, when I had the measles?&nbsp; `If Miss Taylor undertakes

<P>to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'&nbsp; How often

<P>have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, very true.&nbsp; Mr. Perry did say so.&nbsp; I shall never forget
it.

<P>Poor little Emma!&nbsp; You were very bad with the measles; that is,

<P>you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention.

<P>He came four times a day for a week.&nbsp; He said, from the first,

<P>it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles

<P>are a dreadful complaint.&nbsp; I hope whenever poor Isabella's little
ones

<P>have the measles, she will send for Perry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"

<P>said Frank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house.

<P>I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,

<P>and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice

<P>on the spot.&nbsp; I was desired to say so from both.&nbsp; It would
be the

<P>greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.

<P>They can do nothing satisfactorily without you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,

<P>engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young

<P>people set off together without delay for the Crown.&nbsp; There were

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation,

<P>very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some

<P>little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Emma," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected.

<P>Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot

<P>is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband.&nbsp; "What does

<P>all that signify?&nbsp; You will see nothing of it by candlelight.

<P>It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.&nbsp; We never see any

<P>thing of it on our club-nights."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, "Men never

<P>know when things are dirty or not;" and the gentlemen perhaps

<P>thought each to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses

<P>and needless cares."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.

<P>It regarded a supper-room.&nbsp; At the time of the ballroom's being
built,

<P>suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining,

<P>was the only addition.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; This card-room
would

<P>be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted

<P>unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for

<P>any comfortable supper?&nbsp; Another room of much better size might
be

<P>secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,

<P>and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.

<P>This made a difficulty.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts

<P>for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the

<P>gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded

<P>at supper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,

<P>&amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a

<P>wretched suggestion.&nbsp; A private dance, without sitting down to
supper,

<P>was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;

<P>and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.&nbsp; She then took another

<P>line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not think it is so very small.&nbsp; We shall not be many,

<P>you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps

<P>through the passage, was calling out,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.

<P>It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from

<P>the stairs."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish," said Mrs. Weston, "one could know which arrangement our

<P>guests in general would like best.&nbsp; To do what would be most generally

<P>pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very true," cried Frank, "very true.&nbsp; You want your neighbours'

<P>opinions.&nbsp; I do not wonder at you.&nbsp; If one could ascertain
what the

<P>chief of them--the Coles, for instance.&nbsp; They are not far off.

<P>Shall I call upon them?&nbsp; Or Miss Bates?&nbsp; She is still nearer.--

<P>And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand

<P>the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.&nbsp; I think

<P>we do want a larger council.&nbsp; Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates

<P>to join us?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--if you please," said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, "if you

<P>think she will be of any use."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates," said Emma.

<P>"She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.

<P>She will not even listen to your questions.&nbsp; I see no advantage
in

<P>consulting Miss Bates."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!&nbsp; I am very fond

<P>of hearing Miss Bates talk.&nbsp; And I need not bring the whole family,

<P>you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,

<P>gave it his decided approbation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter

<P>at once.&nbsp; She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know

<P>a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.

<P>Fetch Miss Bates.&nbsp; We are growing a little too nice.&nbsp; She
is

<P>a standing lesson of how to be happy.&nbsp; But fetch them both.

<P>Invite them both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Both sir!&nbsp; Can the old lady?" . . .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The old lady!&nbsp; No, the young lady, to be sure.&nbsp; I shall think
you

<P>a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I beg your pardon, sir.&nbsp; I did not immediately recollect.

<P>Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both."

<P>And away he ran.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,

<P>and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered

<P>woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again,

<P>and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--

<P>indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.

<P>All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.

<P>All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music,

<P>tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles

<P>to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--

<P>Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written

<P>to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,

<P>which could not possibly be refused.&nbsp; And a delightful dance it
was

<P>to be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.

<P>As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much

<P>safer character,) she was truly welcome.&nbsp; Her approbation, at once

<P>general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;

<P>and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro,

<P>between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending,

<P>and all in happy enjoyment of the future.&nbsp; The party did not break

<P>up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances

<P>by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston

<P>whisper to his wife, "He has asked her, my dear.&nbsp; That's right.

<P>I knew he would!"
