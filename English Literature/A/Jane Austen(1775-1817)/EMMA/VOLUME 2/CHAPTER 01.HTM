<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,

<P>in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.

<P>She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;

<P>and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject

<P>as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she

<P>had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must

<P>suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--

<P>"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!" she found something else must be
done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.

<P>She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.

<P>There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and

<P>Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered

<P>by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her,

<P>as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she

<P>ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,

<P>as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion

<P>of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--

<P>and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate

<P>and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,

<P>and therefore she seldom went near them.&nbsp; But now she made the
sudden

<P>resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,

<P>as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,

<P>they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The house belonged to people in business.&nbsp; Mrs. and Miss Bates
occupied

<P>the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,

<P>which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially

<P>and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her

<P>knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up

<P>her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter,

<P>almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for

<P>their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after

<P>Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's,

<P>and sweet-cake from the beaufet--"Mrs. Cole had just been there,

<P>just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an

<P>hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind

<P>as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss

<P>Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.

<P>There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from

<P>Mr. Elton since his going away.&nbsp; Emma knew what was coming; they
must

<P>have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone,

<P>and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he

<P>was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies'

<P>ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the

<P>interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always

<P>putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house;

<P>but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther

<P>incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst

<P>all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.

<P>She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;

<P>but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away

<P>from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from

<P>her niece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--

<P>Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--

<P>Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;

<P>for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her,

<P>Jane is so very great a favourite there.&nbsp; Whenever she is with
us,

<P>Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough;

<P>and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.

<P>And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you

<P>cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time

<P>for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have,

<P>we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw

<P>any body more surprized.&nbsp; `Have you, upon your honour?' said she;

<P>`well, that is quite unexpected.&nbsp; Do let me hear what she says.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?&nbsp; I am extremely happy.

<P>I hope she is well?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt,

<P>while eagerly hunting for the letter.--"Oh! here it is.&nbsp; I was
sure

<P>it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,

<P>without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand

<P>so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.

<P>I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was

<P>reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--

<P>a letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;

<P>so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under

<P>my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what

<P>she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,

<P>apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see--

<P>hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.

<P>My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.

<P>She often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty,

<P>now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--

<P>don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive

<P>to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--

<P>every word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had

<P>made out every word.&nbsp; And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are
not

<P>so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!

<P>with the help of spectacles.&nbsp; It is such a blessing!&nbsp; My mother's

<P>are really very good indeed.&nbsp; Jane often says, when she is here,

<P>`I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see

<P>as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish

<P>my eyes may last me as well.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;

<P>and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss

<P>Fairfax's handwriting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are extremely kind," replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;

<P>"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.

<P>I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure

<P>as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf

<P>you know.&nbsp; Ma'am," addressing her, "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse

<P>is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment

<P>repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.

<P>She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming

<P>very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had

<P>almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,

<P>when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.

<P>By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,

<P>she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.&nbsp; But it
is very

<P>remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.

<P>Jane speaks so distinct!&nbsp; However, she will not find her grandmama

<P>at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great

<P>deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years,

<P>you know, since she was here.&nbsp; We never were so long without seeing

<P>her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know

<P>how to make enough of her now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes; next week."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; You are very kind.&nbsp; Yes, next week.&nbsp; Every
body is

<P>so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.&nbsp; I
am

<P>sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they

<P>can be to see her.&nbsp; Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,

<P>because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one

<P>of those days.&nbsp; So very good of them to send her the whole way!

<P>But they always do, you know.&nbsp; Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.

<P>That is what she writes about.&nbsp; That is the reason of her writing
out

<P>of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have

<P>heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, so I imagined.&nbsp; I was afraid there could be little chance

<P>of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So obliging of you!&nbsp; No, we should not have heard, if it had not

<P>been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here

<P>so soon.&nbsp; My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months

<P>with us at least.&nbsp; Three months, she says so, positively, as I

<P>am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.&nbsp; The case is,

<P>you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.&nbsp; Mrs. Dixon has

<P>persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.

<P>They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so

<P>impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,

<P>she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make

<P>it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,

<P>but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter

<P>to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was,

<P>but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's

<P>name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,

<P>and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back

<P>to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.

<P>Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--

<P>I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;

<P>but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak

<P>of his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used

<P>to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell

<P>were very particular about their daughter's not walking out

<P>often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them;

<P>of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell

<P>about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word

<P>that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he

<P>had taken himself.&nbsp; He is a most amiable, charming young man,

<P>I believe.&nbsp; Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account

<P>of things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering

<P>Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon,

<P>and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design

<P>of farther discovery,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed

<P>to come to you at such a time.&nbsp; Considering the very particular

<P>friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected

<P>her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true, very true, indeed.&nbsp; The very thing that we have always

<P>been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her

<P>at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come

<P>if any thing was to happen.&nbsp; But you see, every thing turns out

<P>for the best.&nbsp; They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to

<P>come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;

<P>nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation,

<P>Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the

<P>least backward in any attention.&nbsp; He is a most charming young man.

<P>Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were

<P>out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling

<P>round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed

<P>into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,

<P>with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--

<P>(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we

<P>had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish

<P>of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you

<P>and Mrs. Bates?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel

<P>and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they

<P>should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to try

<P>her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am concerned to hear of it.&nbsp; I think they judge wisely.

<P>But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed.&nbsp; Mrs. Dixon,

<P>I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not,

<P>by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no.&nbsp; You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly
not.

<P>There is no comparison between them.&nbsp; Miss Campbell always was

<P>absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, that of course."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th

<P>of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been

<P>well since.&nbsp; A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?

<P>She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.

<P>Just like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well,

<P>that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,

<P>and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt

<P>that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--

<P>and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here,

<P>than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we

<P>should do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the

<P>Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--

<P>as you will find from Jane's letter.&nbsp; So sudden!--You may guess,

<P>dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!

<P>If it was not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid

<P>we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly.

<P>I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.

<P>I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first,

<P>before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there

<P>being any thing in them to distress her.&nbsp; Jane desired me to do
it,

<P>so I always do:&nbsp; and so I began to-day with my usual caution;

<P>but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I

<P>burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--

<P>which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly

<P>alarmed at.&nbsp; However, when I read on, I found it was not near so
bad

<P>as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her,

<P>that she does not think much about it.&nbsp; But I cannot imagine

<P>how I could be so off my guard.&nbsp; If Jane does not get well soon,

<P>we will call in Mr. Perry.&nbsp; The expense shall not be thought of;

<P>and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say

<P>he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not

<P>suffer it to be so, you know.&nbsp; He has a wife and family to maintain,

<P>and is not to be giving away his time.&nbsp; Well, now I have just given
you

<P>a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I
am

<P>sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it

<P>for her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid we must be running away," said Emma, glancing at Harriet,

<P>and beginning to rise--"My father will be expecting us.

<P>I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than

<P>five minutes, when I first entered the house.&nbsp; I merely called,

<P>because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates;

<P>but I have been so pleasantly detained!&nbsp; Now, however, we must
wish

<P>you and Mrs. Bates good morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.

<P>She regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been

<P>forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard

<P>the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able

<P>to escape the letter itself.
