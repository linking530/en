<P>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken

<P>the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,

<P>merely to have his hair cut.&nbsp; A sudden freak seemed to have seized
him

<P>at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to

<P>return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than

<P>having his hair cut.&nbsp; There was certainly no harm in his travelling

<P>sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air

<P>of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.&nbsp; It
did

<P>not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense,

<P>or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself

<P>to discern in him yesterday.&nbsp; Vanity, extravagance, love of change,

<P>restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;

<P>heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,

<P>indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became

<P>liable to all these charges.&nbsp; His father only called him a coxcomb,

<P>and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like
it,

<P>was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,

<P>and making no other comment than that "all young people would have

<P>their little whims."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit

<P>hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston

<P>was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he

<P>made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.

<P>He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful

<P>and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,

<P>a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard,

<P>was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the

<P>world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being

<P>attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,

<P>and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.

<P>This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy

<P>for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy

<P>of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;

<P>the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being

<P>at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference--

<P>(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short,

<P>of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must

<P>have some weight.&nbsp; He gave her to understand that Frank admired

<P>her extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming;

<P>and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must

<P>not judge him harshly.&nbsp; As Mrs. Weston observed, "all young people

<P>would have their little whims."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so

<P>leniently disposed.&nbsp; In general he was judged, throughout the parishes

<P>of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances

<P>were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--

<P>one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit

<P>among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows

<P>or smiles--Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; The circumstance was told him at Hartfield;

<P>for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately

<P>afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,

<P>"Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for."&nbsp; She had

<P>half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced

<P>her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,

<P>and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect

<P>particularly opportune.&nbsp; Something occurred while they were

<P>at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was

<P>still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years

<P>in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,

<P>and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,

<P>in trade, and only moderately genteel.&nbsp; On their first coming into

<P>the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,

<P>keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last

<P>year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--

<P>the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general

<P>had smiled on them.&nbsp; With their wealth, their views increased;

<P>their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.

<P>They added to their house, to their number of servants,

<P>to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune

<P>and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.

<P>Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body

<P>for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among

<P>the single men, had already taken place.&nbsp; The regular and best

<P>families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--

<P>neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.&nbsp; Nothing should

<P>tempt her to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's

<P>known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she

<P>could wish.&nbsp; The Coles were very respectable in their way, but
they

<P>ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms

<P>on which the superior families would visit them.&nbsp; This lesson,

<P>she very much feared, they would receive only from herself;

<P>she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many

<P>weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,

<P>it found her very differently affected.&nbsp; Donwell and Randalls

<P>had received their invitation, and none had come for her father

<P>and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose

<P>they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not

<P>dine out," was not quite sufficient.&nbsp; She felt that she should

<P>like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea

<P>of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those

<P>whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again,

<P>she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept.

<P>Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.&nbsp; They
had

<P>been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,

<P>and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence.

<P>Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.

<P>The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;

<P>and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission

<P>to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were

<P>at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her

<P>first remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must be declined,"

<P>she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,

<P>that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely

<P>without inclination for the party.&nbsp; The Coles expressed themselves

<P>so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--

<P>so much consideration for her father.&nbsp; "They would have solicited
the

<P>honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen

<P>from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught

<P>of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the

<P>honour of his company.&nbsp; "Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;

<P>and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be

<P>done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,

<P>if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--

<P>Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's

<P>going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending

<P>the whole evening away from him.&nbsp; As for his going, Emma did

<P>not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late,

<P>and the party too numerous.&nbsp; He was soon pretty well resigned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he--"I never was.

<P>No more is Emma.&nbsp; Late hours do not agree with us.&nbsp; I am sorry

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.&nbsp; I think it would be

<P>much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,

<P>and take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;

<P>which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home

<P>without being out in the damp of the evening.&nbsp; The dews of a summer

<P>evening are what I would not expose any body to.&nbsp; However, as they

<P>are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you

<P>will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,

<P>I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,

<P>neither damp, nor cold, nor windy."&nbsp; Then turning to Mrs. Weston,

<P>with a look of gentle reproach--"Ah!&nbsp; Miss Taylor, if you had

<P>not married, you would have staid at home with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away,

<P>it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will

<P>step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing,

<P>not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation.&nbsp; The ladies knew better

<P>how to allay it.&nbsp; Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing

<P>deliberately arranged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough

<P>for talking as usual.&nbsp; "He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard.

<P>He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,

<P>and invite her.&nbsp; James could take the note.&nbsp; But first of
all,

<P>there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.&nbsp; You
will

<P>say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must

<P>decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments,

<P>of course.&nbsp; But you will do every thing right.&nbsp; I need not
tell you

<P>what is to be done.&nbsp; We must remember to let James know that the
carriage

<P>will be wanted on Tuesday.&nbsp; I shall have no fears for you with
him.

<P>We have never been there above once since the new approach was made;

<P>but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.

<P>And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would

<P>have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.

<P>You will not like staying late.&nbsp; You will get very tired when tea

<P>is over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.&nbsp; There will be

<P>a great many people talking at once.&nbsp; You will not like the noise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early,

<P>it will be breaking up the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; "The sooner

<P>every party breaks up, the better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.

<P>Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence.

<P>They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;

<P>but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no

<P>great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought

<P>of than any other person's in the room.&nbsp; You would not wish to
disappoint

<P>and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people

<P>as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged

<P>to you for reminding me.&nbsp; I should be extremely sorry to be giving

<P>them any pain.&nbsp; I know what worthy people they are.&nbsp; Perry
tells

<P>me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.&nbsp; You would not think

<P>it to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.

<P>No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.&nbsp; My dear
Emma,

<P>we must consider this.&nbsp; I am sure, rather than run the risk of
hurting

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.

<P>You will not regard being tired.&nbsp; You will be perfectly safe,

<P>you know, among your friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes, papa.&nbsp; I have no fears at all for myself; and I should
have

<P>no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.

<P>I am only afraid of your sitting up for me.&nbsp; I am not afraid

<P>of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.

<P>She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid

<P>you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your

<P>usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.

<P>You must promise me not to sit up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did, on the condition of some promises on her side:&nbsp; such as
that,

<P>if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;

<P>if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid

<P>should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see

<P>that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.
