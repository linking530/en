<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room
on her return,

<P>and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered,

<P>opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you do my dear?"--said she in a voice
of great

<P>compassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without

<P>attempting to answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she
looks very bad.--

<P>No wonder.&nbsp; Ay, it is but too true.&nbsp; He is to be married

<P>very soon--a good-for-nothing fellow!&nbsp; I have no patience

<P>with him.&nbsp; Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago,

<P>and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss

<P>Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;

<P>and I was almost ready to sink as it was.&nbsp; Well, said I,

<P>all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used

<P>a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I

<P>wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.

<P>And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it.

<P>I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever

<P>I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he

<P>has not had this many a day.&nbsp; But there is one comfort,

<P>my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man

<P>in the world worth having; and with your pretty face

<P>you will never want admirers.&nbsp; Well, poor thing!&nbsp; I won't

<P>disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry

<P>out at once and have done with.&nbsp; The Parrys and Sandersons

<P>luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of
the room,

<P>as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could

<P>be increased by noise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, to the surprise of her sister,

<P>determined on dining with them.&nbsp; Elinor even advised

<P>her against it.&nbsp; But "no, she would go down; she could

<P>bear it very well, and the bustle about her would

<P>be less."&nbsp; Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a

<P>moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly

<P>possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more;

<P>and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,

<P>while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready

<P>to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were

<P>summoned to it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there, though looking most wretchedly,

<P>she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected.

<P>Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half

<P>Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions

<P>to her, this calmness could not have been maintained;

<P>but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction

<P>of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing

<P>that was passing before her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's
kindness,

<P>though its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes

<P>almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments,

<P>and returned her those civilities, which her sister could

<P>not make or return for herself.&nbsp; Their good friend saw

<P>that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing

<P>was due to her which might make her at all less so.

<P>She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness

<P>of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of

<P>its holidays.&nbsp; Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,

<P>was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house,

<P>and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.

<P>Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,

<P>seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained

<P>by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,

<P>by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.

<P>As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was

<P>forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could

<P>stay no longer.&nbsp; With a hasty exclamation of Misery,

<P>and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got

<P>up and hurried out of the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor soul!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as
she was gone,

<P>"how it grieves me to see her!&nbsp; And I declare if she is

<P>not gone away without finishing her wine!&nbsp; And the dried

<P>cherries too!&nbsp; Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.

<P>I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would

<P>send all over the town for it.&nbsp; Well, it is the oddest

<P>thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl

<P>so ill!&nbsp; But when there is plenty of money on one side,

<P>and next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care

<P>no more about such things!--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called
her--

<P>is very rich?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.&nbsp; Did
you ever see

<P>her? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome.

<P>I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married

<P>a very wealthy man.&nbsp; But the family are all rich together.

<P>Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won't come

<P>before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.

<P>No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!

<P>Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man,

<P>be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl,

<P>and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off

<P>from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer

<P>girl is ready to have him.&nbsp; Why don't he, in such a case,

<P>sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants,

<P>and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you,

<P>Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters

<P>came round.&nbsp; But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the

<P>way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of

<P>this age."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey
is?

<P>Is she said to be amiable?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly
ever

<P>heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say

<P>this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her,

<P>that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry

<P>to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could

<P>never agree."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And who are the Ellisons?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her guardians, my dear.&nbsp; But now she
is of age

<P>and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has

<P>made!--What now," after pausing a moment--"your poor sister

<P>is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself.

<P>Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?&nbsp; Poor dear,

<P>it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.&nbsp; Well, by-and-by we

<P>shall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.

<P>What shall we play at?&nbsp; She hates whist I know; but is there

<P>no round game she cares for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.

<P>Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again

<P>this evening.&nbsp; I shall persuade her if I can to go

<P>early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, I believe that will be best for her.&nbsp;
Let her name

<P>her own supper, and go to bed.&nbsp; Lord! no wonder she has

<P>been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two,

<P>for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as

<P>long as that.&nbsp; And so the letter that came today finished it!

<P>Poor soul!&nbsp; I am sure if I had had a notion of it,

<P>I would not have joked her about it for all my money.

<P>But then you know, how should I guess such a thing?&nbsp; I made

<P>sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and

<P>you know young people like to be laughed at about them.&nbsp; Lord!

<P>how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they

<P>hear it!&nbsp; If I had my senses about me I might have called

<P>in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.

<P>But I shall see them tomorrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you
to caution

<P>Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby,

<P>or making the slightest allusion to what has passed,

<P>before my sister.&nbsp; Their own good-nature must point out

<P>to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing

<P>about it when she is present; and the less that may ever

<P>be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings

<P>will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.&nbsp; It
must be terrible

<P>for you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister,

<P>I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her

<P>for the world.&nbsp; You saw I did not all dinner time.

<P>No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are

<P>all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I

<P>give them a hint, as I certainly will.&nbsp; For my part,

<P>I think the less that is said about such things, the better,

<P>the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot.&nbsp; And what does

<P>talking ever do you know?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this affair it can only do harm; more so

<P>perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it

<P>has been attended by circumstances which, for the sake

<P>of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become

<P>the public conversation.&nbsp; I must do THIS justice to

<P>Mr. Willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement

<P>with my sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Law, my dear!&nbsp; Don't pretend to defend
him.

<P>No positive engagement indeed! after taking her all

<P>over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they

<P>were to live in hereafter!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press
the

<P>subject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her

<P>for Willoughby's; since, though Marianne might lose much,

<P>he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.

<P>After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,

<P>with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an
ill-wind,

<P>for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.

<P>He will have her at last; aye, that he will.&nbsp; Mind me,

<P>now, if they an't married by Mid-summer.&nbsp; Lord! how he'll

<P>chuckle over this news!&nbsp; I hope he will come tonight.

<P>It will be all to one a better match for your sister.

<P>Two thousand a year without debt or drawback--except

<P>the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;

<P>but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then

<P>what does it signify?&nbsp; Delaford is a nice place, I can

<P>tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place,

<P>full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great

<P>garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees

<P>in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!

<P>Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we

<P>were there!&nbsp; Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful

<P>stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,

<P>in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is

<P>close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from

<P>the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only

<P>go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,

<P>you may see all the carriages that pass along.

<P>Oh! 'tis a nice place!&nbsp; A butcher hard by in the village,

<P>and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.

<P>To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,

<P>where they are forced to send three miles for their meat,

<P>and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.

<P>Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.

<P>One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.

<P>If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am," said Elinor,

<P>"we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon."

<P>And then rising, she went away to join Marianne,

<P>whom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning,

<P>in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire,

<P>which, till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You had better leave me," was all the notice

<P>that her sister received from her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will leave you," said Elinor, "if you will
go

<P>to bed." But this, from the momentary perverseness

<P>of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.

<P>Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,

<P>soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her

<P>lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,

<P>in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,

<P>she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass,

<P>full of something, in her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear," said she, entering, "I have just
recollected

<P>that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the

<P>house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it

<P>for your sister.&nbsp; My poor husband! how fond he was of it!

<P>Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said

<P>it did him more good than any thing else in the world.

<P>Do take it to your sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear Ma'am," replied Elinor, smiling at the
difference

<P>of the complaints for which it was recommended, "how good

<P>you are!&nbsp; But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,

<P>almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much

<P>service to her as rest, if you will give me leave,

<P>I will drink the wine myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had
not been

<P>five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;

<P>and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,

<P>that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,

<P>of little importance to her, its healing powers,

<P>on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried

<P>on herself as on her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon came in while the party were
at tea,

<P>and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,

<P>Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected

<P>nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he

<P>was already aware of what occasioned her absence.

<P>Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;

<P>for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room

<P>to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--

<P>"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.&nbsp; He knows

<P>nothing of it; do tell him, my dear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to
her's,

<P>and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his

<P>good information, inquired after her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne is not well," said she.&nbsp; "She
has been

<P>indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what
I

<P>heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it

<P>than I could believe possible at first."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you hear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in
short,

<P>that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I

<P>tell you?&nbsp; If you know it already, as surely you must,

<P>I may be spared."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness,

<P>"Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey.&nbsp; Yes, we DO

<P>know it all.&nbsp; This seems to have been a day of general

<P>elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.

<P>Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!&nbsp; Where did you hear it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where
I

<P>had business.&nbsp; Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,

<P>and one of them was giving the other an account of the

<P>intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,

<P>that it was impossible for me not to hear all.&nbsp; The name

<P>of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,

<P>first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive

<P>assertion that every thing was now finally settled

<P>respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer

<P>to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,

<P>with many particulars of preparations and other matters.

<P>One thing, especially, I remember, because it served

<P>to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony

<P>was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat

<P>in Somersetshire.&nbsp; My astonishment!--but it would be

<P>impossible to describe what I felt.&nbsp; The communicative

<P>lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop

<P>till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I

<P>have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is.&nbsp; But have you likewise heard that
Miss Grey

<P>has fifty thousand pounds?&nbsp; In that, if in any thing,

<P>we may find an explanation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at
least

<P>I think"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice

<P>which seemed to distrust itself, "And your sister--

<P>how did she--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her sufferings have been very severe.&nbsp;
I have

<P>only to hope that they may be proportionately short.

<P>It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.&nbsp; Till yesterday,

<P>I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,

<P>perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was

<P>really attached to her.&nbsp; He has been very deceitful! and,

<P>in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!" said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed!&nbsp;
But

<P>your sister does not--I think you said so--she does

<P>not consider quite as you do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know her disposition, and may believe
how eagerly

<P>she would still justify him if she could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by
the removal

<P>of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,

<P>the subject was necessarily dropped.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, who had

<P>watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who

<P>expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication,

<P>in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side,

<P>as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope

<P>and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole

<P>evening more serious and thoughtful than usual.
