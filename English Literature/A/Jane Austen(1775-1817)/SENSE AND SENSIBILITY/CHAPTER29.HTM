<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the house-maid had lit their fire the
next day,

<P>or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning

<P>in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling

<P>against one of the window-seats for the sake of all

<P>the little light she could command from it, and writing

<P>as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.

<P>In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation

<P>and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her

<P>for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone

<P>of the most considerate gentleness,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne, may I ask-?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Elinor," she replied, "ask nothing; you
will

<P>soon know all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sort of desperate calmness with which this
was said,

<P>lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately

<P>followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.

<P>It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,

<P>and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,

<P>at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her

<P>feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing

<P>for the last time to Willoughby.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive
attention

<P>in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and

<P>tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,

<P>with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,

<P>not to speak to her for the world.&nbsp; In such circumstances,

<P>it was better for both that they should not be long together;

<P>and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented

<P>her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,

<P>but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,

<P>made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding

<P>the sight of every body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted
to eat

<P>any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed,

<P>not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing

<P>to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning's

<P>notice entirely to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,

<P>it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting

<P>themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a

<P>letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught

<P>from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,

<P>instantly ran out of the room.&nbsp; Elinor, who saw as plainly

<P>by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must

<P>come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness

<P>at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,

<P>and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it

<P>impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning's notice.&nbsp; That good lady,

<P>however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter

<P>from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,

<P>and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,

<P>that she would find it to her liking.&nbsp; Of Elinor's distress,

<P>she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted

<P>for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing

<P>her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so

<P>desperately in love in my life!&nbsp; MY girls were nothing

<P>to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as

<P>for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.

<P>I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her

<P>waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her

<P>look so ill and forlorn.&nbsp; Pray, when are they to be married?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, though never less disposed to speak
than at

<P>that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack

<P>as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, "And have

<P>you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion

<P>of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?&nbsp; I thought

<P>it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems

<P>to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not

<P>deceive yourself any longer.&nbsp; I do assure you that nothing

<P>would surprise me more than to hear of their being going

<P>to be married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can
you

<P>talk so?&nbsp; Don't we all know that it must be a match, that

<P>they were over head and ears in love with each other from

<P>the first moment they met?&nbsp; Did not I see them together

<P>in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I

<P>know that your sister came to town with me on purpose

<P>to buy wedding clothes?&nbsp; Come, come, this won't do.

<P>Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody

<P>else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you,

<P>for it has been known all over town this ever so long.

<P>I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, Ma'am," said Elinor, very seriously,

<P>"you are mistaken.&nbsp; Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing

<P>in spreading the report, and you will find that you have

<P>though you will not believe me now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had
not

<P>spirits to say more, and eager at all events to know

<P>what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,

<P>where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on

<P>the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,

<P>and two or three others laying by her.&nbsp; Elinor drew near,

<P>but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,

<P>took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,

<P>and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first

<P>was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter,

<P>though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness

<P>of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in

<P>joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands;

<P>and then covering her face with her handkerchief,

<P>almost screamed with agony.&nbsp; Elinor, who knew that such grief,

<P>shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,

<P>watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat

<P>spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter,

<P>read as follows:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just
had the honour of receiving your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letter, for which I beg to return my sincere

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acknowledgments.&nbsp; I am much concerned
to find there

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was anything in my behaviour last night that
did

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not meet your approbation; and though I am
quite at

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a loss to discover in what point I could be
so

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgiveness of what I can assure you to have
been

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly unintentional.&nbsp; I shall never
reflect on

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my former acquaintance with your family in
Devonshire

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself it will not be broken by any mistake
or

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; misapprehension of my actions.&nbsp; My esteem
for your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole family is very sincere; but if I have
been so

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of
more than

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach
myself

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for not having been more guarded in my professions

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of that esteem.&nbsp; That I should ever have
meant more

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will allow to be impossible, when you understand

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this engagement is fulfilled.&nbsp; It is with
great

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regret that I obey your commands in returning
the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letters with which I have been honoured from
you,

"JOHN WILLOUGHBY."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what indignation such a letter as this
must

<P>be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined.&nbsp; Though aware,

<P>before she began it, that it must bring a confession

<P>of his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever,

<P>she was not aware that such language could be suffered

<P>to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby

<P>capable of departing so far from the appearance of every

<P>honourable and delicate feeling--so far from the common

<P>decorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently

<P>cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire

<P>of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no

<P>breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--

<P>a letter of which every line was an insult, and which

<P>proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused over it for some time with indignant

<P>astonishment; then read it again and again; but every

<P>perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man,

<P>and so bitter were her feelings against him, that she

<P>dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound

<P>Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,

<P>not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an

<P>escape from the worst and most irremediable of all

<P>evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man,

<P>as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her earnest meditations on the contents
of the letter,

<P>on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,

<P>and probably, on the very different mind of a very different

<P>person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair

<P>than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed,

<P>Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister,

<P>forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread,

<P>and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room,

<P>that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door,

<P>she went to the window to see who could be coming so

<P>unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive

<P>Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been

<P>ordered till one.&nbsp; Determined not to quit Marianne,

<P>though hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease,

<P>she hurried away to excuse herself from attending

<P>Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed.

<P>Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern

<P>for its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor,

<P>after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she

<P>found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached

<P>just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor,

<P>faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;

<P>for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many

<P>nights since she had really slept; and now, when her

<P>mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense,

<P>the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,

<P>a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness.

<P>A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,

<P>made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express

<P>some sense of her kindness, by saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only wish," replied her sister, "there were

<P>any thing I COULD do, which might be of comfort to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, as every thing else would have been,

<P>was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim,

<P>in the anguish of her heart, "Oh! Elinor, I am miserable,

<P>indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could no longer witness this torrent

<P>of unresisted grief in silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exert yourself, dear Marianne," she cried,

<P>"if you would not kill yourself and all who love you.

<P>Think of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer:

<P>for her sake you must exert yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave
me,

<P>leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!

<P>but do not torture me so.&nbsp; Oh! how easy for those,

<P>who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion!&nbsp; Happy,

<P>happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you call ME happy, Marianne?&nbsp; Ah!
if you knew!--And

<P>can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgive me, forgive me," throwing her arms
round

<P>her sister's neck; "I know you feel for me; I know what

<P>a heart you have; but yet you are--you must be happy;

<P>Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such happiness

<P>as that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "he loves
you,

<P>and only you.&nbsp; You CAN have no grief."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can have no pleasure while I see you in
this state."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you will never see me otherwise.&nbsp;
Mine is

<P>a misery which nothing can do away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must not talk so, Marianne.&nbsp; Have
you no

<P>comforts? no friends?&nbsp; Is your loss such as leaves

<P>no opening for consolation?&nbsp; Much as you suffer now,

<P>think of what you would have suffered if the discovery

<P>of his character had been delayed to a later period--

<P>if your engagement had been carried on for months and months,

<P>as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it.

<P>Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side,

<P>would have made the blow more dreadful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Engagement!" cried Marianne, "there has been

<P>no engagement."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No engagement!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.

<P>He has broken no faith with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he told you that he loved you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes--no--never absolutely.&nbsp; It was every
day implied,

<P>but never professedly declared.&nbsp; Sometimes I thought it

<P>had been--but it never was."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet you wrote to him?"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes--could that be wrong after all that had
passed?--

<P>But I cannot talk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor said no more, and turning again to the
three

<P>letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity

<P>than before, directly ran over the contents of all.

<P>The first, which was what her sister had sent him

<P>on their arrival in town, was to this effect.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I to
imagine, Willoughby, by your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviour last night?&nbsp; Again I demand
an explanation

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of it.&nbsp; I was prepared to meet you with
the pleasure

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which our separation naturally produced, with
the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me to justify.&nbsp; I was repulsed indeed!
I have

excuse

than

of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.&nbsp; You have perhaps been misinformed,
or purposely

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deceived, in something concerning me, which
may have

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lowered me in your opinion.&nbsp; Tell me what
it is,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explain the grounds on which you acted, and
I shall

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.&nbsp;
It

ill

you, that

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your regard for us all was insincere, that
your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviour to me was intended only to deceive,
let

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it be told as soon as possible.&nbsp; My feelings
are at

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present in a state of dreadful indecision;
I wish

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to acquit you, but certainty on either side
will be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ease to what I now suffer.&nbsp; If your sentiments
are

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer what they were, you will return my
notes,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"M.D."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That such letters, so full of affection and
confidence,

<P>could have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake,

<P>would have been unwilling to believe.&nbsp; But her condemnation

<P>of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their

<P>having been written at all; and she was silently grieving

<P>over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited

<P>proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,

<P>and most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne,

<P>perceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to

<P>her that they contained nothing but what any one would

<P>have written in the same situation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly

<P>engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant

<P>had bound us to each other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can believe it," said Elinor; "but unfortunately

<P>he did not feel the same."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and
weeks he

<P>felt it.&nbsp; I know he did.&nbsp; Whatever may have changed him now,
(and

<P>nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done

<P>it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish.

<P>This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up,

<P>was begged of me with the most earnest supplication.

<P>Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice

<P>at that moment!&nbsp; Have you forgot the last evening of our

<P>being together at Barton?&nbsp; The morning that we parted

<P>too!&nbsp; When he told me that it might be many weeks before

<P>we met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment or two she could say no more;

<P>but when this emotion had passed away, she added,

<P>in a firmer tone,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not
by Willoughby."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dearest Marianne, who but himself?&nbsp; By
whom can he

<P>have been instigated?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By all the world, rather than by his own heart.

<P>I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance

<P>leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe

<P>his nature capable of such cruelty.&nbsp; This woman of whom he

<P>writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own

<P>dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous

<P>to bely me.&nbsp; Beyond you three, is there a creature

<P>in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil

<P>than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not contend, and only replied,

<P>"Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them

<P>be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister,

<P>by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own

<P>innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.

<P>It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists

<P>such malevolence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no," cried Marianne, "misery such as mine
has

<P>no pride.&nbsp; I care not who knows that I am wretched.

<P>The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world.

<P>Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and

<P>independent as they like--may resist insult, or return

<P>mortification--but I cannot.&nbsp; I must feel--I must be

<P>wretched--and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness

<P>of it that can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But for my mother's sake and mine--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would do more than for my own.&nbsp; But
to appear

<P>happy when I am so miserable--Oh! who can require it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again they were both silent.&nbsp; Elinor was
employed

<P>in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window,

<P>from the window to the fire, without knowing that she

<P>received warmth from one, or discerning objects through

<P>the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,

<P>with her head leaning against one of its posts,

<P>again took up Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering

<P>over every sentence, exclaimed--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby,
could this

<P>be yours!&nbsp; Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.&nbsp; Elinor,

<P>nothing can.&nbsp; Whatever he might have heard against me--

<P>ought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to

<P>have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing

<P>myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)

<P>which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.

<P>Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?

<P>Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Marianne, in no possible way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet this woman--who knows what her art
may

<P>have been?--how long it may have been premeditated,

<P>and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can

<P>she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and

<P>attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one,

<P>no one--he talked to me only of myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly
agitated,

<P>and it ended thus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor, I must go home.&nbsp; I must go and
comfort mama.

<P>Can not we be gone to-morrow?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To-morrow, Marianne!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for

<P>Willoughby's sake--and now who cares for me? Who regards me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We
owe

<P>Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of

<P>the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but
I cannot

<P>stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions

<P>and remarks of all these people.&nbsp; The Middletons and

<P>Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?&nbsp; The pity of such

<P>a woman as Lady Middleton!&nbsp; Oh, what would HE say to that!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for
a

<P>moment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease;

<P>and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one

<P>posture to another, till growing more and more hysterical,

<P>her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all,

<P>and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call

<P>for assistance.&nbsp; Some lavender drops, however, which she

<P>was at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from

<P>that time till Mrs. Jennings returned, she continued

<P>on the bed quiet and motionless.
