<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's illness, though weakening in its
kind,

<P>had not been long enough to make her recovery slow;

<P>and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence

<P>in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,

<P>within four days after the arrival of the latter,

<P>into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room.&nbsp; When there, at her own

<P>particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth

<P>her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon

<P>was invited to visit her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His emotion on entering the room, in seeing
her altered

<P>looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately

<P>held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture,

<P>must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,

<P>or the consciousness of its being known to others;

<P>and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying

<P>complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable

<P>recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,

<P>brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza

<P>already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,

<P>the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,

<P>and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed
than

<P>her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,

<P>and therefore watching to very different effect,

<P>saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose

<P>from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in

<P>the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself

<P>to think that something more than gratitude already dawned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of another day or two, Marianne
growing

<P>visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,

<P>urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes,

<P>began to talk of removing to Barton.&nbsp; On HER measures

<P>depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could

<P>not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel

<P>Brandon was soon brought, by their united request,

<P>to consider his own abode there as equally determinate,

<P>if not equally indispensable.&nbsp; At his and Mrs. Jennings's

<P>united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed

<P>on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,

<P>for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,

<P>at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,

<P>whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable

<P>for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure

<P>to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course

<P>of a few weeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day of separation and departure arrived;

<P>and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened

<P>a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full

<P>of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart

<P>from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding

<P>Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,

<P>was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he

<P>seemed anxious that she should engross at least half.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others

<P>were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,

<P>and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned

<P>to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid

<P>for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon

<P>immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and
Marianne

<P>bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.

<P>Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most

<P>solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,

<P>was the office of each watchful companion, and each

<P>found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness

<P>of spirits.&nbsp; To Elinor, the observation of the latter

<P>was particularly grateful.&nbsp; She, who had seen her week

<P>after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish

<P>of heart which she had neither courage to speak of,

<P>nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other

<P>could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,

<P>in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,

<P>must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered

<P>on scenes of which every field and every tree brought

<P>some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent

<P>and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,

<P>sat earnestly gazing through the window.&nbsp; But here,

<P>Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,

<P>as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she

<P>had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural

<P>in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,

<P>and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.&nbsp; In the

<P>whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction

<P>of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner

<P>had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne

<P>turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,

<P>as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight

<P>of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could

<P>be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed

<P>at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,

<P>it never passed away without the atonement of a smile.

<P>After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;

<P>but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,

<P>procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their

<P>favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name

<P>in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,

<P>put the music aside, and after running over the keys

<P>for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,

<P>and closed the instrument again; declaring however

<P>with firmness as she did so, that she should in future

<P>practice much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning produced no abatement in these

<P>happy symptoms.&nbsp; On the contrary, with a mind and body

<P>alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with

<P>more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of

<P>Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party

<P>which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits

<P>and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the weather is settled, and I have recovered

<P>my strength," said she, "we will take long walks together

<P>every day.&nbsp; We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,

<P>and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's

<P>new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;

<P>and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,

<P>and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told

<P>they once reached.&nbsp; I know we shall be happy.&nbsp; I know

<P>the summer will pass happily away.&nbsp; I mean never to be

<P>later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner

<P>I shall divide every moment between music and reading.

<P>I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course

<P>of serious study.&nbsp; Our own library is too well known to me,

<P>to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.

<P>But there are many works well worth reading at the Park;

<P>and there are others of more modern production which I

<P>know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.&nbsp; By reading only six

<P>hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month

<P>a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself

<P>to want."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated

<P>so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager

<P>fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid

<P>indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing

<P>excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous

<P>self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she

<P>remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,

<P>and feared she had that to communicate which might again

<P>unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time

<P>this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.&nbsp; Willing therefore

<P>to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her

<P>sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it.

<P>But the resolution was made only to be broken.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had been two or three days at home,
before

<P>the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself

<P>to venture out.&nbsp; But at last a soft, genial morning appeared;

<P>such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the

<P>mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm,

<P>was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,

<P>in the lane before the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the
feebleness

<P>of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her

<P>illness required;--and they had advanced only so far

<P>beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,

<P>the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes

<P>turned towards it, Marianne calmly said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There, exactly there,"--pointing with one
hand,

<P>"on that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there I

<P>first saw Willoughby."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice sunk with the word, but presently
reviving

<P>she added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am thankful to find that I can look with
so little pain

<P>on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?"--

<P>hesitatingly it was said.--"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk

<P>of it now, I hope, as I ought to do."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for regret," said Marianne, "I have done
with that,

<P>as far as HE is concerned.&nbsp; I do not mean to talk to you

<P>of what my feelings have been for him, but what they

<P>are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,

<P>if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS

<P>acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,

<P>if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked

<P>as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story

<P>of that unfortunate girl"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopt.&nbsp; Elinor joyfully treasured
her words

<P>as she answered,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you could be assured of that, you think
you

<P>should be easy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in
it;--

<P>for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has

<P>been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must

<P>it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,

<P>but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose

<P>me to"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How then," asked her sister, "would you account

<P>for his behaviour?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would
I suppose

<P>him, only fickle, very, very fickle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor said no more.&nbsp; She was debating
within herself

<P>on the eligibility of beginning her story directly,

<P>or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--

<P>and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not wishing him too much good," said
Marianne

<P>at last with a sigh, "when I wish his secret reflections

<P>may be no more unpleasant than my own.&nbsp; He will suffer

<P>enough in them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you compare your conduct with his?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I compare it with what it ought to have
been;

<P>I compare it with yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our situations have borne little resemblance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have borne more than our conduct.--Do
not,

<P>my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know

<P>your judgment must censure.&nbsp; My illness has made me think--

<P>It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.

<P>Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly

<P>able to reflect.&nbsp; I considered the past: I saw in my

<P>own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance

<P>with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence

<P>towards myself, and want of kindness to others.

<P>I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,

<P>and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led

<P>me to the grave.&nbsp; My illness, I well knew, had been

<P>entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my

<P>own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.

<P>Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I

<P>did not know my danger till the danger was removed;

<P>but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,

<P>I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness

<P>of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,

<P>and to you all, did not kill me at once.&nbsp; Had I died,--

<P>in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,

<P>my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful

<P>selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the

<P>murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR

<P>remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled

<P>her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.

<P>Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,

<P>or some failing indulged.&nbsp; Every body seemed injured by me.

<P>The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,

<P>I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.&nbsp; To the Middletons,

<P>to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,

<P>I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened

<P>against their merits, and a temper irritated by their

<P>very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,

<P>little as they deserve, I had given less than their due.

<P>But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged

<P>by me.&nbsp; I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;

<P>yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion

<P>that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was

<P>before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate

<P>of you and your comfort?&nbsp; Did I imitate your forbearance,

<P>or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those

<P>offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude

<P>which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--

<P>not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I

<P>had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every

<P>exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow

<P>to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which

<P>had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for or I

<P>professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my

<P>sake."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving
spirit;

<P>and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest

<P>to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support

<P>which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.

<P>Marianne pressed her hand and replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good.--The future must be my
proof.

<P>I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering

<P>to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.

<P>They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.

<P>I shall now live solely for my family.&nbsp; You, my mother,

<P>and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me;

<P>you will share my affections entirely between you.

<P>>From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest

<P>incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society,

<P>it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,

<P>my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities,

<P>the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.

<P>As for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall

<P>ever forget him, would be idle.&nbsp; His remembrance can be overcome

<P>by no change of circumstances or opinions.&nbsp; But it shall

<P>be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,

<P>by constant employment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused--and added in a low voice, "If I
could

<P>but know HIS heart, everything would become easy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting

<P>on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding

<P>her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than

<P>at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection

<P>did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself

<P>leading to the fact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She managed the recital, as she hoped, with
address;

<P>prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply

<P>and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby

<P>grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,

<P>and softened only his protestations of present regard.

<P>Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes

<P>were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter

<P>than even sickness had left them.&nbsp; A thousand inquiries

<P>sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.

<P>She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,

<P>unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and

<P>tears covered her cheeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards
home;

<P>and till they reached the door of the cottage,

<P>easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be

<P>though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of

<P>nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together;

<P>and was carefully minute in every particular of speech

<P>and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged.

<P>As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss

<P>of gratitude and these two words just articulate through

<P>her tears, "Tell mama," withdrew from her sister and

<P>walked slowly up stairs.&nbsp; Elinor would not attempt

<P>to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;

<P>and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,

<P>and a resolution of reviving the subject again,

<P>should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour

<P>to fulfill her parting injunction.
