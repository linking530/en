<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's
visit

<P>at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,

<P>filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings

<P>for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every

<P>one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the

<P>comings and goings of all their acquaintance.&nbsp; She wondered,

<P>with little intermission what could be the reason of it;

<P>was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over

<P>every kind of distress that could have befallen him,

<P>with a fixed determination that he should not escape

<P>them all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something very melancholy must be the matter,

<P>I am sure," said she.&nbsp; "I could see it in his face.

<P>Poor man!&nbsp; I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.

<P>The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand

<P>a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.

<P>I do think he must have been sent for about money matters,

<P>for what else can it be?&nbsp; I wonder whether it is so.

<P>I would give anything to know the truth of it.&nbsp; Perhaps it

<P>is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,

<P>because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.

<P>May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,

<P>for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.

<P>I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.

<P>It is not so very likely he should be distressed in

<P>his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,

<P>and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.

<P>I wonder what it can be!&nbsp; May be his sister is worse

<P>at Avignon, and has sent for him over.&nbsp; His setting off

<P>in such a hurry seems very like it.&nbsp; Well, I wish him out

<P>of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into

<P>the bargain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp;
Her opinion

<P>varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming

<P>equally probable as they arose.&nbsp; Elinor, though she felt

<P>really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,

<P>could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly

<P>away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;

<P>for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion

<P>justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,

<P>her wonder was otherwise disposed of.&nbsp; It was engossed

<P>by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby

<P>on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly

<P>interesting to them all.&nbsp; As this silence continued,

<P>every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible

<P>with the disposition of both.&nbsp; Why they should not openly

<P>acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant

<P>behaviour to each other declared to have taken place,

<P>Elinor could not imagine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could easily conceive that marriage might
not

<P>be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby

<P>was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.

<P>His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven

<P>hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income

<P>could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained

<P>of his poverty.&nbsp; But for this strange kind of secrecy

<P>maintained by them relative to their engagement, which

<P>in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;

<P>and it was so wholly contradictory to their general

<P>opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered

<P>her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt

<P>was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing could be more expressive of attachment

<P>to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.&nbsp; To Marianne

<P>it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's

<P>heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the

<P>affectionate attention of a son and a brother.&nbsp; The cottage

<P>seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;

<P>many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;

<P>and if no general engagement collected them at the park,

<P>the exercise which called him out in the morning was

<P>almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day

<P>was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his

<P>favourite pointer at her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening in particular, about a week after

<P>Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed

<P>more than usually open to every feeling of attachment

<P>to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's

<P>happening to mention her design of improving the cottage

<P>in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration

<P>of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What!" he exclaimed--"Improve this dear cottage!

<P>No. THAT I will never consent to.&nbsp; Not a stone must

<P>be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,

<P>if my feelings are regarded."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood,

<P>"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother

<P>will never have money enough to attempt it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am heartily glad of it", he cried.&nbsp;
"May she

<P>always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Willoughby.&nbsp; But you may be
assured that I

<P>would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment

<P>of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements

<P>in the world.&nbsp; Depend upon it that whatever unemployed

<P>sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,

<P>I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose

<P>of it in a manner so painful to you.&nbsp; But are you really

<P>so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am," said he.&nbsp; "To me it is faultless.&nbsp;
Nay, more,

<P>I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness

<P>is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull

<P>Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that
smokes,

<P>I suppose," said Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with
all

<P>and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience

<P>or INconvenience about it, should the least variation

<P>be perceptible.&nbsp; Then, and then only, under such a roof, I

<P>might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even
under

<P>the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,

<P>you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you

<P>now do this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby,

<P>"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will

<P>always have one claim of my affection, which no other can

<P>possibly share."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,

<P>whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,

<P>as plainly denoted how well she understood him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How often did I wish," added he, "when I was
at

<P>Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were

<P>inhabited!&nbsp; I never passed within view of it without admiring

<P>its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.

<P>How little did I then think that the very first news

<P>I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into

<P>the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I

<P>felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,

<P>which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I

<P>should experience from it, can account for.&nbsp; Must it not have

<P>been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a lowered voice.

<P>Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this

<P>house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?&nbsp; You would rob it

<P>of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear

<P>parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which

<P>so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,

<P>you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,

<P>and every body would be eager to pass through the room

<P>which has hitherto contained within itself more real

<P>accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of

<P>the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration

<P>of the kind should be attempted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a good woman," he warmly replied.

<P>"Your promise makes me easy.&nbsp; Extend it a little farther,

<P>and it will make me happy.&nbsp; Tell me that not only your

<P>house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find

<P>you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you

<P>will always consider me with the kindness which has made

<P>everything belonging to you so dear to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's

<P>behaviour during the whole of the evening declared

<P>at once his affection and happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said
Mrs. Dashwood,

<P>when he was leaving them.&nbsp; "I do not ask you to come in

<P>the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.
