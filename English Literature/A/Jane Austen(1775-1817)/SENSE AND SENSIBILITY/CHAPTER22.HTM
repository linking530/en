<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, who had never much toleration for
any

<P>thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,

<P>or even difference of taste from herself, was at

<P>this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state

<P>of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles,

<P>or to encourage their advances; and to the invariable

<P>coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every

<P>endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally

<P>attributed that preference of herself which soon became

<P>evident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy,

<P>who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,

<P>or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy

<P>and frank communication of her sentiments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were
often

<P>just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour

<P>Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers

<P>had received no aid from education: she was ignorant

<P>and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,

<P>her want of information in the most common particulars,

<P>could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her

<P>constant endeavour to appear to advantage.&nbsp; Elinor saw,

<P>and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education

<P>might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less

<P>tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,

<P>of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,

<P>her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;

<P>and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company

<P>of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;

<P>whose want of instruction prevented their meeting

<P>in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct

<P>toward others made every shew of attention and deference

<P>towards herself perfectly valueless.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will think my question an odd one, I dare
say,"

<P>said Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together

<P>from the park to the cottage--"but pray, are you

<P>personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother,

<P>Mrs. Ferrars?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor DID think the question a very odd one,

<P>and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she

<P>had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed!" replied Lucy; "I wonder at that,
for I

<P>thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.

<P>Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman

<P>she is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," returned Elinor, cautious of giving her
real

<P>opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous

<P>of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--

<P>"I know nothing of her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring

<P>about her in such a way," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively

<P>as she spoke; "but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish

<P>I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice

<P>of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked
on

<P>for a few minutes in silence.&nbsp; It was broken by Lucy,

<P>who renewed the subject again by saying, with some

<P>hesitation,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently
curious.

<P>I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be

<P>thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth

<P>having as yours.&nbsp; And I am sure I should not have the smallest

<P>fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your

<P>advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation

<P>as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.

<P>I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry I do NOT," said Elinor, in great
astonishment,

<P>"if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.

<P>But really I never understood that you were at all connected

<P>with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,

<P>I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not
at all

<P>wonder at it.&nbsp; But if I dared tell you all, you would not be

<P>so much surprised.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me

<P>at present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come

<P>must depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately connected."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,

<P>with only one side glance at her companion to observe its

<P>effect on her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "what do you
mean?

<P>Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?&nbsp; Can you be?"

<P>And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such

<P>a sister-in-law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I

<P>never saw him in my life; but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor,

<P>"to his eldest brother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,

<P>that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not

<P>an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.

<P>She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine

<P>the reason or object of such a declaration; and though

<P>her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,

<P>and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may well be surprised," continued Lucy;

<P>"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;

<P>for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it

<P>to you or any of your family; because it was always meant

<P>to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully

<P>kept so by me to this hour.&nbsp; Not a soul of all my relations

<P>know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned

<P>it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence

<P>in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my

<P>behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars

<P>must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.

<P>And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,

<P>when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has

<P>the highest opinion in the world of all your family,

<P>and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite

<P>as his own sisters."--She paused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor for a few moments remained silent.

<P>Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too

<P>great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,

<P>and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,

<P>which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--

<P>"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been engaged these four years."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four years!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt
unable

<P>to believe it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not know," said she, "that you were
even

<P>acquainted till the other day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our acquaintance, however, is of many years
date.

<P>He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your uncle!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; Mr. Pratt.&nbsp; Did you never hear him
talk

<P>of Mr. Pratt?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion

<P>of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He was four years with my uncle, who lives
at Longstaple,

<P>near Plymouth.&nbsp; It was there our acquaintance begun,

<P>for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,

<P>and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till

<P>a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost

<P>always with us afterwards.&nbsp; I was very unwilling to enter

<P>into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and

<P>approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved

<P>him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--

<P>Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,

<P>you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is

<P>very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," answered Elinor, without knowing
what

<P>she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,

<P>with revived security of Edward's honour and love,

<P>and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward

<P>Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at

<P>what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;

<P>but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.

<P>We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling.&nbsp;
"Mr. Edward

<P>Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,

<P>and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,

<P>is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely

<P>to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is strange," replied Elinor, in a most
painful perplexity,

<P>"that I should never have heard him even mention your name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; considering our situation, it was not
strange.

<P>Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.--

<P>You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,

<P>there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name

<P>to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his

<P>sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough

<P>for his not mentioning it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but
her

<P>self-command did not sink with it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four years you have been engaged," said she

<P>with a firm voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may
have

<P>to wait.&nbsp; Poor Edward!&nbsp; It puts him quite out of heart."

<P>Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,

<P>"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look

<P>at this face.&nbsp; It does not do him justice, to be sure,

<P>but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person

<P>it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put it into her hands as she spoke; and
when Elinor

<P>saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a

<P>too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood

<P>might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of

<P>its being Edward's face.&nbsp; She returned it almost instantly,

<P>acknowledging the likeness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never been able," continued Lucy, "to
give

<P>him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,

<P>for he has been always so anxious to get it!&nbsp; But I am

<P>determined to set for it the very first opportunity."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are quite in the right," replied Elinor
calmly.

<P>They then proceeded a few paces in silence.&nbsp; Lucy spoke first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in
the world

<P>of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must

<P>know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach

<P>his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.

<P>I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding

<P>proud woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly did not seek your confidence,"
said Elinor;

<P>"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I

<P>may be depended on.&nbsp; Your secret is safe with me;

<P>but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary

<P>a communication.&nbsp; You must at least have felt that my

<P>being acquainted with it could not add to its safety."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,

<P>hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the

<P>falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;

<P>but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was afraid you would think I was taking
a great

<P>liberty with you," said she, "in telling you all this.

<P>I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,

<P>but I have known you and all your family by description

<P>a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if

<P>you was an old acquaintance.&nbsp; Besides in the present case,

<P>I really thought some explanation was due to you after my

<P>making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother;

<P>and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose

<P>advice I can ask.&nbsp; Anne is the only person that knows of it,

<P>and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great

<P>deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her

<P>betraying me.&nbsp; She does not know how to hold her tongue,

<P>as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest

<P>fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was

<P>mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.

<P>You can't think how much I go through in my mind from

<P>it altogether.&nbsp; I only wonder that I am alive after what

<P>I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.

<P>Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing

<P>him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.

<P>I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor
did

<P>not feel very compassionate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes." continued Lucy, after wiping her
eyes,

<P>"I think whether it would not be better for us both

<P>to break off the matter entirely."&nbsp; As she said this,

<P>she looked directly at her companion.&nbsp; "But then

<P>at other times I have not resolution enough for it.--

<P>I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,

<P>as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.

<P>And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't

<P>think I could be equal to it.&nbsp; What would you advise

<P>me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?&nbsp; What would you

<P>do yourself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the
question;

<P>"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.

<P>Your own judgment must direct you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure," continued Lucy, after a few minutes

<P>silence on both sides, "his mother must provide for him

<P>sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!

<P>Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at

<P>Barton?&nbsp; He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,

<P>to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did he come from your uncle's, then, when
he visited us?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with
us.

<P>Did you think he came directly from town?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible
of

<P>every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity;

<P>"I remember he told us, that he had been staying

<P>a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth."

<P>She remembered too, her own surprise at the time,

<P>at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,

<P>at his total silence with respect even to their names.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?"

<P>repeated Lucy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We did, indeed, particularly so when he first
arrived."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I begged him to exert himself for fear you

<P>should suspect what was the matter; but it made him

<P>so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a

<P>fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--

<P>Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;

<P>for he writes in wretched spirits.&nbsp; I heard from him just

<P>before I left Exeter;" taking a letter from her pocket

<P>and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.

<P>"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;

<P>but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,

<P>I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full

<P>as possible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could
doubt

<P>no longer.&nbsp; This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,

<P>might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have

<P>been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them

<P>by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,

<P>could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she

<P>was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could

<P>hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;

<P>and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression

<P>of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for

<P>the time complete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Writing to each other," said Lucy, returning
the

<P>letter into her pocket, "is the only comfort we have

<P>in such long separations.&nbsp; Yes, I have one other comfort

<P>in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.

<P>If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.

<P>I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at

<P>Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,

<P>but not equal to a picture.&nbsp; Perhaps you might notice

<P>the ring when you saw him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did," said Elinor, with a composure of voice,

<P>under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond

<P>any thing she had ever felt before.&nbsp; She was mortified,

<P>shocked, confounded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately for her, they had now reached the
cottage,

<P>and the conversation could be continued no farther.

<P>After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles

<P>returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty

<P>to think and be wretched.
