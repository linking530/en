<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was
satisfied.--

<P>She had found in her every thing that could tend to make

<P>a farther connection between the families undesirable.--

<P>She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her

<P>determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all

<P>the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement,

<P>and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been

<P>otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful

<P>for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her

<P>from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation,

<P>preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any

<P>solicitude for her good opinion.&nbsp; Or at least, if she did not

<P>bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered

<P>to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable,

<P>she OUGHT to have rejoiced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so
very much

<P>elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest

<P>and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make

<P>the attention which seemed only paid her because she was

<P>NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow

<P>her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,

<P>because her real situation was unknown.&nbsp; But that it was so,

<P>had not only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time,

<P>but was declared over again the next morning more openly,

<P>for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down

<P>in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,

<P>to tell her how happy she was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chance proved a lucky one, for a message
from

<P>Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear friend," cried Lucy, as soon as they
were

<P>by themselves, "I come to talk to you of my happiness.

<P>Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars's way

<P>of treating me yesterday?&nbsp; So exceeding affable as she

<P>was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--

<P>but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an

<P>affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say,

<P>she had quite took a fancy to me.&nbsp; Now was not it so?--

<P>You saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She was certainly very civil to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--

<P>I saw a vast deal more.&nbsp; Such kindness as fell to the share

<P>of nobody but me!--No pride, no hauteur, and your sister

<P>just the same--all sweetness and affability!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor wished to talk of something else, but
Lucy still

<P>pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness;

<P>and Elinor was obliged to go on.--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,"

<P>said she, "nothing could be more flattering than their

<P>treatment of you;--but as that was not the case"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guessed you would say so"--replied Lucy

<P>quickly--"but there was no reason in the world why

<P>Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not,

<P>and her liking me is every thing.&nbsp; You shan't talk me

<P>out of my satisfaction.&nbsp; I am sure it will all end well,

<P>and there will be no difficulties at all, to what I

<P>used to think.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman,

<P>and so is your sister.&nbsp; They are both delightful women,

<P>indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable

<P>Mrs. Dashwood was!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did
not

<P>attempt any.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you

<P>don't speak;--sure you an't well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never was in better health."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am glad of it with all my heart; but really
you did

<P>not look it.&nbsp; I should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have

<P>been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven

<P>knows what I should have done without your friendship."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though
doubting

<P>her own success.&nbsp; But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she

<P>directly replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard

<P>for me, and next to Edward's love, it is the greatest

<P>comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one

<P>good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often,

<P>for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood,

<P>so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say,

<P>and Edward spends half his time with his sister--besides,

<P>Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--

<P>and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say

<P>more than once, they should always be glad to see me.--

<P>They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you

<P>tell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak

<P>too high."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elinor would not give her any encouragement

<P>to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister.&nbsp; Lucy continued.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure I should have seen it in a moment,

<P>if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me.&nbsp; If she had only

<P>made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying

<P>a word, and never after had took any notice of me,

<P>and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know

<P>what I mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding

<P>sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair.

<P>I could not have stood it.&nbsp; For where she DOES dislike,

<P>I know it is most violent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was prevented from making any reply
to this

<P>civil triumph, by the door's being thrown open, the servant's

<P>announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's immediately walking in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance
of each

<P>shewed that it was so.&nbsp; They all looked exceedingly foolish;

<P>and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk

<P>out of the room again, as to advance farther into it.

<P>The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form,

<P>which they would each have been most anxious to avoid,

<P>had fallen on them.--They were not only all three together,

<P>but were together without the relief of any other person.

<P>The ladies recovered themselves first.&nbsp; It was not Lucy's

<P>business to put herself forward, and the appearance of

<P>secrecy must still be kept up.&nbsp; She could therefore only

<P>LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,

<P>said no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was
she,

<P>for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she

<P>forced herself, after a moment's recollection,

<P>to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,

<P>and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still

<P>improved them.&nbsp; She would not allow the presence of Lucy,

<P>nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,

<P>to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,

<P>and that she had very much regretted being from home,

<P>when he called before in Berkeley Street.&nbsp; She would

<P>not be frightened from paying him those attentions which,

<P>as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the

<P>observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them

<P>to be narrowly watching her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward,
and he

<P>had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still

<P>exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case

<P>rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;

<P>for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor

<P>could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed
determined

<P>to make no contribution to the comfort of the others,

<P>and would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS

<P>said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer

<P>all the information about her mother's health, their coming

<P>to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,

<P>but never did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon

<P>afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as

<P>to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne,

<P>to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,

<P>and THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away

<P>several minutes on the landing-place, with the most

<P>high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.

<P>When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures

<P>of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into

<P>the drawing-room immediately.&nbsp; Her pleasure in seeing him

<P>was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,

<P>and strongly spoken.&nbsp; She met him with a hand that would

<P>be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear Edward!" she cried, "this is a moment
of great

<P>happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,

<P>but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he

<P>really felt.&nbsp; Again they all sat down, and for a moment

<P>or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the

<P>most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes

<P>at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each

<P>other should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.

<P>Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice

<P>Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her

<P>not finding London agree with her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't think of me!" she replied with spirited

<P>earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears

<P>as she spoke, "don't think of MY health.&nbsp; Elinor is well,

<P>you see.&nbsp; That must be enough for us both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This remark was not calculated to make Edward
or

<P>Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy,

<P>who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like London?" said Edward, willing
to say

<P>any thing that might introduce another subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all.&nbsp; I expected much pleasure
in it,

<P>but I have found none.&nbsp; The sight of you, Edward, is the

<P>only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you

<P>are what you always were!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused--no one spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, Elinor," she presently added, "we
must

<P>employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton.

<P>In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust,

<P>Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Edward muttered something, but what it
was,

<P>nobody knew, not even himself.&nbsp; But Marianne, who saw

<P>his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever

<P>cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,

<P>and soon talked of something else.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street

<P>yesterday!&nbsp; So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much

<P>to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with this admirable discretion did she
defer

<P>the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more

<P>disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly

<P>disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did
you

<P>not come?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was engaged elsewhere."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Engaged!&nbsp; But what was that, when such
friends

<P>were to be met?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager
to take

<P>some revenge on her, "you think young men never stand

<P>upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them,

<P>little as well as great."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed
entirely

<P>insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I
am very

<P>sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.

<P>And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience

<P>in the world; the most scrupulous in performing

<P>every engagement, however minute, and however it

<P>may make against his interest or pleasure.&nbsp; He is the

<P>most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,

<P>and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body

<P>I ever saw.&nbsp; Edward, it is so, and I will say it.

<P>What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you

<P>must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept

<P>of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of her commendation, in the present
case,

<P>however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the

<P>feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very

<P>unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going so soon!" said Marianne; "my dear Edward,

<P>this must not be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drawing him a little aside, she whispered

<P>her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer.

<P>But even this encouragement failed, for he would go;

<P>and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted

<P>two hours, soon afterwards went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can bring her here so often?" said Marianne,

<P>on her leaving them.&nbsp; "Could not she see that we wanted

<P>her gone!--how teazing to Edward!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy
has been

<P>the longest known to him of any.&nbsp; It is but natural

<P>that he should like to see her as well as ourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked at her steadily, and said,
"You know,

<P>Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.

<P>If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,

<P>as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect

<P>that I am the last person in the world to do it.

<P>I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are

<P>not really wanted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then left the room; and Elinor dared not
follow

<P>her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise

<P>of secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that

<P>would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences

<P>of her still continuing in an error might be, she was

<P>obliged to submit to it.&nbsp; All that she could hope, was

<P>that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the

<P>distress of hearing Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the

<P>repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended

<P>their recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.
