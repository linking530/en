<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took
place

<P>the next day, and two of her daughters went with her;

<P>but Marianne excused herself from being of the party,

<P>under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,

<P>who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby

<P>the night before of calling on her while they were absent,

<P>was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their return from the park they found Willoughby's

<P>curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,

<P>and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture

<P>had been just.&nbsp; So far it was all as she had foreseen;

<P>but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight

<P>had taught her to expect.&nbsp; They were no sooner in the

<P>passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour

<P>apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief

<P>at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.

<P>Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room

<P>she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,

<P>who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back

<P>towards them.&nbsp; He turned round on their coming in,

<P>and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook

<P>of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anything the matter with her?" cried Mrs.
Dashwood

<P>as she entered--"is she ill?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope not," he replied, trying to look cheerful;

<P>and with a forced smile presently added, "It is I who may

<P>rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a

<P>very heavy disappointment!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Disappointment?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement
with you.

<P>Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege

<P>of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on

<P>business to London.&nbsp; I have just received my dispatches,

<P>and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration

<P>I am now come to take my farewell of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To London!--and are you going this morning?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost this moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very unfortunate.&nbsp; But Mrs. Smith
must

<P>be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from

<P>us long I hope."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coloured as he replied, "You are very kind,
but I

<P>have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.

<P>My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within

<P>the twelvemonth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?&nbsp;
Is Allenham the only

<P>house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?

<P>For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed

<P>on the ground he only replied, "You are too good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.

<P>Elinor felt equal amazement.&nbsp; For a few moments every one

<P>was silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that
at

<P>Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not

<P>press you to return here immediately, because you only

<P>can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;

<P>and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question

<P>your judgment than to doubt your inclination."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My engagements at present," replied Willoughby,

<P>confusedly, "are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopt.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was too much
astonished

<P>to speak, and another pause succeeded.&nbsp; This was broken

<P>by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, "It is folly

<P>to linger in this manner.&nbsp; I will not torment myself

<P>any longer by remaining among friends whose society

<P>it is impossible for me now to enjoy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then hastily took leave of them all and
left

<P>the room.&nbsp; They saw him step into his carriage,

<P>and in a minute it was out of sight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and
instantly

<P>quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern

<P>and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her
mother's.

<P>She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.

<P>Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment,

<P>and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness

<P>to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover,

<P>so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.&nbsp; One moment she feared

<P>that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the

<P>next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and

<P>her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room

<P>was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,

<P>though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was,

<P>a quarrel seemed almost impossible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whatever might be the particulars of their
separation,

<P>her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought

<P>with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow

<P>which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving

<P>way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In about half an hour her mother returned,
and though

<P>her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from
Barton, Elinor,"

<P>said she, as she sat down to work, "and with how heavy a heart

<P>does he travel?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is all very strange.&nbsp; So suddenly
to be gone! It

<P>seems but the work of a moment.&nbsp; And last night he was

<P>with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?&nbsp; And now,

<P>after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending

<P>to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must

<P>have happened.&nbsp; He did not speak, he did not behave

<P>like himself.&nbsp; YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.

<P>What can it be?&nbsp; Can they have quarrelled?&nbsp; Why else should
he

<P>have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor;
I could

<P>plainly see THAT.&nbsp; He had not the power of accepting it.

<P>I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can

<P>perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed

<P>strange to me as well as to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you, indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I have explained it to myself in the
most

<P>satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt

<P>where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you

<P>shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.&nbsp; I am persuaded

<P>that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,

<P>disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views

<P>for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--

<P>and that the business which she sends him off to transact

<P>is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.&nbsp; This is what I

<P>believe to have happened.&nbsp; He is, moreover, aware that she

<P>DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore

<P>at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,

<P>and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,

<P>to give into her schemes, and absent himself from

<P>Devonshire for a while.&nbsp; You will tell me, I know,

<P>that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen

<P>to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method

<P>of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.

<P>And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you would have told me, that it might
or might not

<P>have happened.&nbsp; Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your

<P>feelings!&nbsp; You had rather take evil upon credit than good.

<P>You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt

<P>for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.

<P>You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took

<P>leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour

<P>has shewn.&nbsp; And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,

<P>or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?&nbsp; Are

<P>no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they

<P>are not certainties?&nbsp; Is nothing due to the man whom we

<P>have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world

<P>to think ill of?&nbsp; To the possibility of motives unanswerable

<P>in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?&nbsp; And,

<P>after all, what is it you suspect him of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can hardly tell myself.&nbsp; But suspicion
of

<P>something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence

<P>of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.

<P>There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged

<P>of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it

<P>is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.

<P>Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient

<P>reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.

<P>But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge

<P>them at once.&nbsp; Secrecy may be advisable; but still I

<P>cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not blame him, however, for departing from

<P>his character, where the deviation is necessary.

<P>But you really do admit the justice of what I have said

<P>in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not entirely.&nbsp; It may be proper to conceal
their

<P>engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--

<P>and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient

<P>for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.

<P>But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you
accuse

<P>Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange

<P>indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day

<P>for incautiousness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want no proof of their affection," said
Elinor;

<P>"but of their engagement I do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am perfectly satisfied of both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet not a syllable has been said to you on
the

<P>subject, by either of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not wanted syllables where actions
have

<P>spoken so plainly.&nbsp; Has not his behaviour to Marianne

<P>and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,

<P>declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,

<P>and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest

<P>relation?&nbsp; Have we not perfectly understood each other?

<P>Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,

<P>his attentive and affectionate respect?&nbsp; My Elinor,

<P>is it possible to doubt their engagement?&nbsp; How could

<P>such a thought occur to you?&nbsp; How is it to be supposed

<P>that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your

<P>sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps

<P>for months, without telling her of his affection;--that

<P>they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I confess," replied Elinor, "that every circumstance

<P>except ONE is in favour of their engagement;

<P>but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,

<P>and with me it almost outweighs every other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How strange this is!&nbsp; You must think
wretchedly indeed

<P>of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,

<P>you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.

<P>Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister

<P>all this time?&nbsp; Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I cannot think that.&nbsp; He must and
does love her

<P>I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But with a strange kind of tenderness, if
he can

<P>leave her with such indifference, such carelessness

<P>of the future, as you attribute to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must remember, my dear mother, that I
have never

<P>considered this matter as certain.&nbsp; I have had my doubts,

<P>I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they

<P>may soon be entirely done away.&nbsp; If we find they correspond,

<P>every fear of mine will be removed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A mighty concession indeed!&nbsp; If you were
to see

<P>them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to

<P>be married.&nbsp; Ungracious girl!&nbsp; But I require no such proof.

<P>Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;

<P>no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open

<P>and unreserved.&nbsp; You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.

<P>It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.&nbsp; But why?

<P>Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any

<P>inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor.

<P>"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his

<P>integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.

<P>It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.

<P>I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his

<P>manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,

<P>and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.

<P>But all this may be explained by such a situation of his

<P>affairs as you have supposed.&nbsp; He had just parted from

<P>my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;

<P>and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,

<P>to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet

<P>aware that by declining your invitation, by saying

<P>that he was going away for some time, he should seem

<P>to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,

<P>be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.&nbsp; In such a case,

<P>a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been

<P>more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent

<P>with his general character;--but I will not raise objections

<P>against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,

<P>as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from

<P>what I may think right and consistent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You speak very properly.&nbsp; Willoughby
certainly does

<P>not deserve to be suspected.&nbsp; Though WE have not known

<P>him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;

<P>and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?&nbsp; Had he been

<P>in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,

<P>it might have been odd that he should leave us without

<P>acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.

<P>It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,

<P>for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;

<P>and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now

<P>be very advisable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret;

<P>and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations

<P>of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,

<P>and hope for the justice of all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,

<P>when she entered the room and took her place at the table

<P>without saying a word.&nbsp; Her eyes were red and swollen;

<P>and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained

<P>with difficulty.&nbsp; She avoided the looks of them all,

<P>could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her

<P>mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,

<P>her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst

<P>into tears and left the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This violent oppression of spirits continued
the

<P>whole evening.&nbsp; She was without any power, because she

<P>was without any desire of command over herself.

<P>The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby

<P>overpowered her in an instant; and though her family

<P>were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was

<P>impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear

<P>of every subject which her feelings connected with him.
