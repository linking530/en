<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances
of his

<P>release might appear to the whole family, it was certain

<P>that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would

<P>be employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after

<P>experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement,

<P>contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already

<P>done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected

<P>of him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction

<P>of another.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple
one.

<P>It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering

<P>that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,

<P>it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable

<P>in the present case as he really did, so much in need of

<P>encouragement and fresh air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How soon he had walked himself into the proper

<P>resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising

<P>it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,

<P>and how he was received, need not be particularly told.

<P>This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to

<P>table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival,

<P>he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent,

<P>and was not only in the rapturous profession of

<P>the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,

<P>one of the happiest of men.&nbsp; His situation indeed was

<P>more than commonly joyful.&nbsp; He had more than the ordinary

<P>triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise

<P>his spirits.&nbsp; He was released without any reproach

<P>to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed

<P>his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--

<P>and elevated at once to that security with another,

<P>which he must have thought of almost with despair,

<P>as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.

<P>He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from

<P>misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken

<P>in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,

<P>as his friends had never witnessed in him before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,

<P>all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment

<P>to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,"

<P>said he, "the consequence of ignorance of the world--

<P>and want of employment.&nbsp; Had my brother given me

<P>some active profession when I was removed at eighteen

<P>from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure,

<P>it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple

<P>with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable

<P>preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit,

<P>any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance

<P>from her for a few months, I should very soon have

<P>outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing

<P>more with the world, as in such case I must have done.

<P>But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any

<P>profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself,

<P>I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first

<P>twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,

<P>which belonging to the university would have given me;

<P>for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen.

<P>I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy

<P>myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home

<P>in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend,

<P>no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance,

<P>it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,

<P>where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure

<P>of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part

<P>of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared

<P>everything that was amiable and obliging.&nbsp; She was pretty

<P>too--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little

<P>of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see

<P>no defects.&nbsp; Considering everything, therefore, I hope,

<P>foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since

<P>in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural

<P>or an inexcusable piece of folly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change which a few hours had wrought in
the minds

<P>and the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as

<P>promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how

<P>to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough

<P>thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,

<P>nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained

<P>conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,

<P>the sight and society of both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne could speak HER happiness only by
tears.

<P>Comparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,

<P>though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to

<P>give her neither spirits nor language.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From

<P>the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another,

<P>that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying

<P>the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every

<P>thing by turns but tranquil.&nbsp; But when the second moment

<P>had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude

<P>removed, compared her situation with what so lately it

<P>had been,--saw him honourably released from his former

<P>engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release,

<P>to address herself and declare an affection as tender,

<P>as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she

<P>was oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;--

<P>and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily

<P>familiarized with any change for the better, it required

<P>several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any

<P>degree of tranquillity to her heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least
for

<P>a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him,

<P>it was impossible that less than a week should be given

<P>up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or suffice

<P>to say half that was to be said of the past, the present,

<P>and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in

<P>the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more

<P>subjects than can really be in common between any two

<P>rational creatures, yet with lovers it is different.

<P>Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication

<P>is even made, till it has been made at least twenty

<P>times over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable
wonder

<P>among them all, formed of course one of the earliest

<P>discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor's particular knowledge

<P>of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one

<P>of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances

<P>she had ever heard.&nbsp; How they could be thrown together,

<P>and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry

<P>a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak

<P>without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged

<P>to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been

<P>thrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension

<P>to make out.&nbsp; To her own heart it was a delightful affair,

<P>to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but

<P>to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward could only attempt an explanation by
supposing,

<P>that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity

<P>of the one had been so worked on by the flattery

<P>of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.

<P>Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,

<P>of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's

<P>affairs might have done, if applied to in time.

<P>She repeated it to Edward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "THAT was exactly like Robert,"--was his immediate

<P>observation.--"And THAT," he presently added, "might

<P>perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between

<P>them first began.&nbsp; And Lucy perhaps at first might

<P>think only of procuring his good offices in my favour.

<P>Other designs might afterward arise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long it had been carrying on between them,

<P>however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out;

<P>for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since

<P>his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her

<P>but from herself, and her letters to the very last were

<P>neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.

<P>Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred

<P>to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it

<P>burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been

<P>for some time, he believed, half stupified between

<P>the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.

<P>He put the letter into Elinor's hands.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "DEAR SIR,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being very sure
I have long lost your affections,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thought myself at liberty to bestow
my own

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on another, and have no doubt of being as happy
with

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him as I once used to think I might be with
you;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart
was

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another's.&nbsp; Sincerely wish you happy in
your choice,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it shall not be my fault if we are not
always

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good friends, as our near relationship now
makes

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proper.&nbsp; I can safely say I owe you no
ill-will,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and am sure you will be too generous to do
us any

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ill offices.&nbsp; Your brother has gained
my affections

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entirely, and as we could not live without
one

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another, we are just returned from the altar,
and

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks,
which

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place your dear brother has great curiosity
to see,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but thought I would first trouble you with
these

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; few lines, and shall always remain,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sincere
well-wisher, friend, and sister,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"LUCY FERRARS.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have burnt
all your letters, and will return

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your picture the first opportunity.&nbsp; Please
to destroy

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are
very

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome to keep."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor read and returned it without any comment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,"

<P>said Edward.--"For worlds would not I have had a letter

<P>of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it

<P>is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I have blushed over

<P>the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that

<P>since the first half year of our foolish--business--this

<P>is the only letter I ever received from her, of which

<P>the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However it may have come about," said Elinor,

<P>after a pause,--"they are certainly married.&nbsp; And your mother

<P>has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment.

<P>The independence she settled on Robert, through resentment

<P>against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;

<P>and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand

<P>a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the

<P>other for intending to do.&nbsp; She will hardly be less hurt,

<P>I suppose, by Robert's marrying Lucy, than she would have

<P>been by your marrying her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always

<P>was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it,

<P>and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what state the affair stood at present between
them,

<P>Edward knew not, for no communication with any of his family

<P>had yet been attempted by him.&nbsp; He had quitted Oxford

<P>within four and twenty hours after Lucy's letter arrived,

<P>and with only one object before him, the nearest road

<P>to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct,

<P>with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.

<P>He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with

<P>Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate,

<P>it is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with

<P>which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite

<P>of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts,

<P>and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts,

<P>he did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception.

<P>It was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he

<P>said it very prettily.&nbsp; What he might say on the subject

<P>a twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination

<P>of husbands and wives.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to
go off

<P>with a flourish of malice against him in her message

<P>by Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself,

<P>now thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no

<P>scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness

<P>of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,

<P>even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her

<P>ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--

<P>they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want

<P>of education; and till her last letter reached him,

<P>he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,

<P>good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.

<P>Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented

<P>his putting an end to an engagement, which, long before

<P>the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger,

<P>had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it my duty," said he, "independent
of my feelings,

<P>to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,

<P>when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all

<P>appearance without a friend in the world to assist me.

<P>In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing

<P>to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,

<P>how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted

<P>on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing

<P>but the most disinterested affection was her inducement?

<P>And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,

<P>or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be

<P>fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,

<P>and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.

<P>She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; but she might suppose that something would
occur

<P>in your favour; that your own family might in time relent.

<P>And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,

<P>for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination

<P>nor her actions.&nbsp; The connection was certainly a

<P>respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among

<P>her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,

<P>it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward was, of course, immediately convinced
that

<P>nothing could have been more natural than Lucy's conduct,

<P>nor more self-evident than the motive of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always
scold

<P>the imprudence which compliments themselves, for having

<P>spent so much time with them at Norland, when he must

<P>have felt his own inconstancy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,"
said she;

<P>"because--to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations

<P>were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you

<P>were THEN situated, could never be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could only plead an ignorance of his own
heart,

<P>and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was simple enough to think, that because
my FAITH

<P>was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being

<P>with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was

<P>to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.&nbsp; I felt

<P>that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;

<P>and till I began to make comparisons between yourself

<P>and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.&nbsp; After that,

<P>I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,

<P>and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the

<P>expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger

<P>is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor smiled, and shook her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's

<P>being expected at the Cottage, as he really wished

<P>not only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an

<P>opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented

<P>his giving him the living of Delaford--"Which, at present,"

<P>said he, "after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine

<P>were on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven

<P>him for offering."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW he felt astonished himself that he had
never yet

<P>been to the place.&nbsp; But so little interest had be taken

<P>in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,

<P>garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of

<P>the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,

<P>who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard

<P>it with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One question after this only remained undecided,

<P>between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.

<P>They were brought together by mutual affection,

<P>with the warmest approbation of their real friends;

<P>their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make

<P>their happiness certain--and they only wanted something

<P>to live upon.&nbsp; Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor

<P>one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could

<P>call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood

<P>should advance anything; and they were neither of them

<P>quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty

<P>pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward was not entirely without hopes of some

<P>favourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT

<P>he rested for the residue of their income.&nbsp; But Elinor

<P>had no such dependence; for since Edward would still

<P>be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself

<P>had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language

<P>as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,

<P>she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other

<P>purpose than to enrich Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel

<P>Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction,

<P>and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time

<P>since her living at Barton, more company with her than

<P>her house would hold.&nbsp; Edward was allowed to retain the

<P>privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore

<P>walked every night to his old quarters at the Park;

<P>from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough

<P>to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where,

<P>in his evening hours at least, he had little to do

<P>but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six

<P>and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind

<P>which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks,

<P>all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement

<P>of her mother's language, to make it cheerful.

<P>Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.

<P>No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew

<P>nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his

<P>visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.

<P>Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,

<P>and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done

<P>for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen
advanced

<P>in the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each

<P>other's acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise.

<P>Their resemblance in good principles and good sense,

<P>in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably

<P>have been sufficient to unite them in friendship,

<P>without any other attraction; but their being in love

<P>with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,

<P>made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,

<P>which might otherwise have waited the effect of time

<P>and judgment.

<P>have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport,

<P>now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.

<P>Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her

<P>honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth

<P>her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,

<P>had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,

<P>by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--

<P>"I do think," she continued, "nothing was ever carried

<P>on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called

<P>and sat a couple of hours with me.&nbsp; Not a soul suspected

<P>anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!

<P>came crying to me the day after, in a great fright

<P>for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to

<P>get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her

<P>money before she went off to be married, on purpose

<P>we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not

<P>seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give

<P>her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she

<P>thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,

<P>in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.

<P>And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them

<P>along with them in the chaise is worse than all.

<P>Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you

<P>must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to

<P>comfort him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.

<P>Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor

<P>Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he

<P>considered the existence of each, under such a blow,

<P>with grateful wonder.&nbsp; Robert's offence was unpardonable,

<P>but Lucy's was infinitely worse.&nbsp; Neither of them were

<P>ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,

<P>if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,

<P>his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,

<P>nor be permitted to appear in her presence.&nbsp; The secrecy

<P>with which everything had been carried on between them,

<P>was rationally treated as enormously heightening

<P>the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred

<P>to the others, proper measures would have been taken

<P>to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join

<P>with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward

<P>had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus

<P>be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--

<P>He thus continued:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's
name,

<P>which does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment,

<P>not a line has been received from him on the occasion.

<P>Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,

<P>and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line

<P>to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter

<P>of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,

<P>and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;

<P>for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart,

<P>and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms

<P>with her children."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paragraph was of some importance to the

<P>prospects and conduct of Edward.&nbsp; It determined him

<P>to attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly

<P>in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A letter of proper submission!" repeated he;

<P>"would they have me beg my mother's pardon for Robert's

<P>ingratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can

<P>make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor

<P>penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy;

<P>but that would not interest.--I know of no submission

<P>that IS proper for me to make."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may certainly ask to be forgiven," said
Elinor,

<P>"because you have offended;--and I should think you

<P>might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern

<P>for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you

<P>your mother's anger."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He agreed that he might.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little
humility

<P>may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement,

<P>almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had nothing to urge against it, but still

<P>resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;

<P>and therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared

<P>a much greater willingness to make mean concessions

<P>by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,

<P>instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London,

<P>and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.--

<P>"And if they really DO interest themselves," said Marianne,

<P>in her new character of candour, "in bringing about

<P>a reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny

<P>are not entirely without merit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of
only three

<P>or four days, the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.--

<P>They were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward

<P>might have some personal knowledge of his future home,

<P>and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what

<P>improvements were needed to it; and from thence,

<P>after staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed

<P>on his journey to town.
