<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,

<P>that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up

<P>the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with

<P>visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period

<P>to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found

<P>the Miss Dashwoods very ready to ressume their former share.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the third or fourth morning after their

<P>being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,

<P>on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,

<P>entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting

<P>by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance

<P>as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her

<P>time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,

<P>by saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard
the news?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am.&nbsp; What is it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something so strange!&nbsp; But you shall
hear it all.--

<P>When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite

<P>in a fuss about the child.&nbsp; She was sure it was very

<P>ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.

<P>So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'

<P>says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--'

<P>and nurse said just the same.&nbsp; But Charlotte, she would

<P>not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily

<P>he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he

<P>stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,

<P>be said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world

<P>but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.&nbsp; And so,

<P>just as he was going away again, it came into my head,

<P>I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,

<P>but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.

<P>So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,

<P>and seemed to know something or other, and at last he

<P>said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report

<P>should reach the young ladies under your care as to their

<P>sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say,

<P>that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope

<P>Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What! is Fanny ill?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is exactly what I said, my dear.&nbsp;
'Lord!' says I,

<P>'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the

<P>long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,

<P>seems to be this.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young

<P>man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it

<P>turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing

<P>in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged

<P>above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you,

<P>my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,

<P>except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--

<P>There is no great wonder in their liking one another;

<P>but that matters should be brought so forward between them,

<P>and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened

<P>to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it

<P>out directly.&nbsp; Well, and so this was kept a great secret,

<P>for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your

<P>brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--

<P>till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a

<P>well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.

<P>'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond

<P>of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'

<P>and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all

<P>alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to

<P>come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five

<P>minutes before, that she thought to make a match between

<P>Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.

<P>So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity

<P>and pride.&nbsp; She fell into violent hysterics immediately,

<P>with such screams as reached your brother's ears,

<P>as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,

<P>thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.

<P>So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,

<P>for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming

<P>what was going on.&nbsp; Poor soul!&nbsp; I pity HER.&nbsp; And I must
say,

<P>I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded

<P>like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.

<P>Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;

<P>and your brother, he walked about the room, and said

<P>he did not know what to do.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood declared

<P>they should not stay a minute longer in the house,

<P>and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,

<P>to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed

<P>up their clothes.&nbsp; THEN she fell into hysterics again,

<P>and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,

<P>and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.

<P>The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor

<P>cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he

<P>came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,

<P>she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.

<P>I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,

<P>with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.

<P>Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he

<P>hears of it!&nbsp; To have his love used so scornfully! for

<P>they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.

<P>I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest

<P>passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.&nbsp; He and I

<P>had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,

<P>that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may

<P>be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she

<P>was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,

<P>for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;

<P>and so she may, for what I care.&nbsp; I have no pity for

<P>either of them.&nbsp; I have no notion of people's making

<P>such a to-do about money and greatness.&nbsp; There is no

<P>reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;

<P>for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well

<P>by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,

<P>she knows better than any body how to make the most

<P>of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only

<P>allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good

<P>an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.

<P>Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage

<P>as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;

<P>and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my

<P>Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them

<P>exactly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had
had

<P>time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able

<P>to give such an answer, and make such observations,

<P>as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.

<P>Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary

<P>interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late

<P>often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her

<P>at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,

<P>in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able

<P>to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to

<P>give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality

<P>on the conduct of every one concerned in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could hardly determine what her own expectation

<P>of its event really was; though she earnestly tried

<P>to drive away the notion of its being possible to end

<P>otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.

<P>What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could

<P>not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;

<P>and still more anxious to know how Edward would

<P>conduct himself.&nbsp; For HIM she felt much compassion;--

<P>for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure

<P>that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,

<P>Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for

<P>its discussion.&nbsp; No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,

<P>in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in

<P>endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,

<P>without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,

<P>or any resentment against Edward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was
going

<P>to remove what she really believed to be her sister's

<P>chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she

<P>feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and

<P>to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,

<P>which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own

<P>disappointment over again.&nbsp; But unwelcome as such a task

<P>must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore

<P>hastened to perform it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very far from wishing to dwell on her
own

<P>feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,

<P>any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised

<P>since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might

<P>suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.

<P>Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could

<P>not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied

<P>by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged

<P>rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,

<P>and cried excessively.&nbsp; Elinor was to be the comforter

<P>of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;

<P>and all the comfort that could be given by assurances

<P>of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest

<P>vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,

<P>was readily offered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Marianne for some time would give credit
to neither.

<P>Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging

<P>as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,

<P>could she feel less than herself!&nbsp; As for Lucy Steele,

<P>she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely

<P>incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could

<P>not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards

<P>to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.

<P>She would not even admit it to have been natural;

<P>and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,

<P>by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge

<P>of mankind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first communication had reached no farther
than

<P>to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time

<P>it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,

<P>and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some

<P>time all that could be done was to soothe her distress,

<P>lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.&nbsp; The first

<P>question on her side, which led to farther particulars,

<P>was,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long has this been known to you, Elinor?
has

<P>he written to you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have known it these four months.&nbsp; When
Lucy

<P>first came to Barton Park last November, she told me

<P>in confidence of her engagement."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the
astonishment

<P>which her lips could not utter.&nbsp; After a pause of wonder,

<P>she exclaimed--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four months!--Have you known of this four
months?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor confirmed it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What!--while attending me in all my misery,
has this

<P>been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was not fit that you should then know how
much

<P>I was the reverse!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four months!"--cried Marianne again.--"So
calm!--

<P>so cheerful!--how have you been supported?"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise
to

<P>Lucy, obliged me to be secret.&nbsp; I owed it to her, therefore,

<P>to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my

<P>family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,

<P>which it could not be in my power to satisfy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne seemed much struck.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have very often wished to undeceive yourself
and my

<P>mother," added Elinor; "and once or twice I have attempted it;--

<P>but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four months!--and yet you loved him!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while
the comfort

<P>of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing

<P>how much I felt.&nbsp; Now, I can think and speak of it with

<P>little emotion.&nbsp; I would not have you suffer on my account;

<P>for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.

<P>I have many things to support me.&nbsp; I am not conscious of having

<P>provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,

<P>I have borne it as much as possible without spreading

<P>it farther.&nbsp; I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.

<P>I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always

<P>doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,

<P>in the end he must become so.&nbsp; Lucy does not want sense,

<P>and that is the foundation on which every thing good may

<P>be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is

<P>bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,

<P>and all that can be said of one's happiness depending

<P>entirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it

<P>is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--

<P>Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior

<P>in person and understanding to half her sex; and time

<P>and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought

<P>another superior to HER."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If such is your way of thinking," said Marianne,

<P>"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily

<P>to be made up by something else, your resolution,

<P>your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be

<P>wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand you.--You do not suppose that
I have ever

<P>felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this

<P>hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak

<P>of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make

<P>you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained

<P>to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--

<P>It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the

<P>very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all

<P>my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--

<P>This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,

<P>by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most

<P>deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have

<P>had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--

<P>I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,

<P>without hearing one circumstance that could make me less

<P>desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;

<P>nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--

<P>I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,

<P>and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the

<P>punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--

<P>And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you

<P>know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--

<P>If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you

<P>may suppose that I have suffered NOW.&nbsp; The composure

<P>of mind with which I have brought myself at present

<P>to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been

<P>willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and

<P>painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--

<P>they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--

<P>No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,

<P>perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I

<P>owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was

<P>VERY unhappy."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was quite subdued.--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Elinor," she cried, "you have made me
hate

<P>myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--

<P>you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me

<P>in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering

<P>for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I

<P>can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself,

<P>I have been trying to do it away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tenderest caresses followed this confession.

<P>In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had

<P>no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise

<P>she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged

<P>never to speak of the affair to any one with the least

<P>appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying

<P>the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see

<P>Edward himself, if chance should bring them together,

<P>without any diminution of her usual cordiality.--

<P>These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt

<P>that she had injured, no reparation could be too much

<P>for her to make.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She performed her promise of being discreet,

<P>to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings

<P>had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,

<P>dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three

<P>times to say, "Yes, ma'am."--She listened to her praise

<P>of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another,

<P>and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection,

<P>it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances

<P>towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal

<P>to any thing herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning brought a farther trial of
it,

<P>in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious

<P>aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them

<P>news of his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have heard, I suppose," said he with great
solemnity,

<P>as soon as he was seated, "of the very shocking discovery

<P>that took place under our roof yesterday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They all looked their assent; it seemed too
awful

<P>a moment for speech.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister," he continued, "has suffered
dreadfully.

<P>Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such

<P>complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may

<P>be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.

<P>Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.

<P>But I would not alarm you too much.&nbsp; Donavan says there

<P>is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution

<P>is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.

<P>She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!

<P>She says she never shall think well of anybody again;

<P>and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--

<P>meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness

<P>had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!&nbsp; It

<P>was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she

<P>had asked these young women to her house; merely because

<P>she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,

<P>well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;

<P>for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you

<P>and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,

<P>was attending her daughter.&nbsp; And now to be so rewarded!

<P>'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her

<P>affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead

<P>of them.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here he stopped to be thanked; which being
done,

<P>he went on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first
Fanny

<P>broke it to her, is not to be described.&nbsp; While she with

<P>the truest affection had been planning a most eligible

<P>connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could

<P>be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such

<P>a suspicion could never have entered her head!&nbsp; If she

<P>suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be

<P>in THAT quarter.&nbsp; 'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might

<P>have thought myself safe.' She was quite in an agony.

<P>We consulted together, however, as to what should be done,

<P>and at last she determined to send for Edward.

<P>He came.&nbsp; But I am sorry to relate what ensued.

<P>All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end

<P>to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose

<P>by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of

<P>no avail.&nbsp; Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.

<P>I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.

<P>His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case

<P>of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on

<P>him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings

<P>in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters

<P>grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition

<P>to this, if he still persisted in this low connection,

<P>represented to him the certain penury that must attend

<P>the match.&nbsp; His own two thousand pounds she protested

<P>should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far

<P>would she be from affording him the smallest assistance,

<P>that if he were to enter into any profession with a view

<P>of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent

<P>him advancing in it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,

<P>clapped her hands together, and cried, "Gracious God!

<P>can this be possible!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well may you wonder, Marianne," replied her
brother,

<P>"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.

<P>Your exclamation is very natural."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered

<P>her promises, and forbore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this, however," he continued, "was urged
in vain.

<P>Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in

<P>the most determined manner.&nbsp; Nothing should prevail on

<P>him to give up his engagement.&nbsp; He would stand to it,

<P>cost him what it might."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then," cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,

<P>no longer able to be silent, "he has acted like an honest

<P>man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had

<P>done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.

<P>I have some little concern in the business, as well

<P>as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe

<P>there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one

<P>who more deserves a good husband."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his
nature

<P>was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished

<P>to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.

<P>He therefore replied, without any resentment,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would by no means speak disrespectfully
of any

<P>relation of yours, madam.&nbsp; Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,

<P>a very deserving young woman, but in the present case

<P>you know, the connection must be impossible.

<P>And to have entered into a secret engagement with a

<P>young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman

<P>especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,

<P>is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,

<P>I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person

<P>whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp; We all wish

<P>her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout

<P>the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,

<P>in like circumstances, would adopt.&nbsp; It has been dignified

<P>and liberal.&nbsp; Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear

<P>it will be a bad one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;

<P>and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,

<P>while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could

<P>not reward him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did
it end?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy
rupture:--

<P>Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.

<P>He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether

<P>he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can

<P>make no inquiry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor young man!--and what is to become of
him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, indeed, ma'am!&nbsp; It is a melancholy
consideration.

<P>Born to the prospect of such affluence!&nbsp; I cannot conceive

<P>a situation more deplorable.&nbsp; The interest of two thousand

<P>pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added

<P>the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,

<P>within three months have been in the receipt of two

<P>thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has

<P>thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself

<P>a more wretched condition.&nbsp; We must all feel for him;

<P>and the more so, because it is totally out of our power

<P>to assist him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am
sure

<P>he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;

<P>and so I would tell him if I could see him.&nbsp; It is not fit

<P>that he should be living about at his own charge now,

<P>at lodgings and taverns."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness
towards Edward,

<P>though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he would only have done as well by himself,"

<P>said John Dashwood, "as all his friends were disposed to do

<P>by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,

<P>and would have wanted for nothing.&nbsp; But as it is, it must

<P>be out of anybody's power to assist him.&nbsp; And there is one

<P>thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than

<P>all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind

<P>of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,

<P>which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions.

<P>I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over

<P>the business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well!" said Mrs. Jennings, "that is HER revenge.

<P>Everybody has a way of their own.&nbsp; But I don't think mine

<P>would be, to make one son independent, because another had

<P>plagued me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne got up and walked about the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can anything be more galling to the spirit
of a man,"

<P>continued John, "than to see his younger brother in

<P>possession of an estate which might have been his own?

<P>Poor Edward!&nbsp; I feel for him sincerely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes more spent in the same kind of
effusion,

<P>concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his

<P>sisters that he really believed there was no material

<P>danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need

<P>not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;

<P>leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments

<P>on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded

<P>Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon
as he

<P>quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve

<P>impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings,

<P>they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.
