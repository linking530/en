<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits

<P>of her friend.&nbsp; His visit afforded her but a very

<P>partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it

<P>appeared so imperfect.&nbsp; It was evident that he was unhappy;

<P>she wished it were equally evident that he still

<P>distinguished her by the same affection which once

<P>she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the

<P>continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;

<P>and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted

<P>one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room

<P>the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,

<P>who was always eager to promote their happiness as far

<P>as she could, soon left them to themselves.&nbsp; But before she

<P>was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,

<P>turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going into the village to see my horses,"

<P>said be, "as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall

<P>be back again presently."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
***
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward returned to them with fresh admiration

<P>of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,

<P>he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;

<P>and the village itself, in a much higher situation than

<P>the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had

<P>exceedingly pleased him.&nbsp; This was a subject which ensured

<P>Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe

<P>her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more

<P>minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,

<P>when Edward interrupted her by saying, "You must not

<P>enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge

<P>in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance

<P>and want of taste if we come to particulars.&nbsp; I shall call

<P>hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange

<P>and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;

<P>and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be

<P>indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.

<P>You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can

<P>honestly give.&nbsp; I call it a very fine country--the

<P>hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,

<P>and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich

<P>meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here

<P>and there.&nbsp; It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,

<P>because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it

<P>is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can

<P>easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,

<P>grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.

<P>I know nothing of the picturesque."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne;

<P>"but why should you boast of it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one
kind

<P>of affectation, Edward here falls into another.&nbsp; Because he

<P>believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties

<P>of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with

<P>such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less

<P>discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.

<P>He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration

<P>of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.

<P>Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with

<P>the taste and elegance of him who first defined what

<P>picturesque beauty was.&nbsp; I detest jargon of every kind,

<P>and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,

<P>because I could find no language to describe them

<P>in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really
feel

<P>all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess

<P>to feel.&nbsp; But, in return, your sister must allow me

<P>to feel no more than I profess.&nbsp; I like a fine prospect,

<P>but not on picturesque principles.&nbsp; I do not like crooked,

<P>twisted, blasted trees.&nbsp; I admire them much more if they

<P>are tall, straight, and flourishing.&nbsp; I do not like ruined,

<P>tattered cottages.&nbsp; I am not fond of nettles or thistles,

<P>or heath blossoms.&nbsp; I have more pleasure in a snug

<P>farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,

<P>happy villages please me better than the finest banditti

<P>in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked with amazement at Edward,

<P>with compassion at her sister.&nbsp; Elinor only laughed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne

<P>remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly

<P>engaged her attention.&nbsp; She was sitting by Edward, and

<P>in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed

<P>so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait

<P>of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,"
she cried.

<P>"Is that Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give

<P>you some.&nbsp; But I should have thought her hair had been darker."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really
felt--

<P>but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own

<P>vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed

<P>by his.&nbsp; He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary

<P>glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister's hair.

<P>The setting always casts a different shade on it,

<P>you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious
likewise.

<P>That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as

<P>well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their

<P>conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free

<P>gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been

<P>procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.

<P>She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,

<P>and affecting to take no notice of what passed,

<P>by instantly talking of something else, she internally

<P>resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing

<P>the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,

<P>that it was exactly the shade of her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and
it

<P>ended in an absence of mind still more settled.

<P>He was particularly grave the whole morning.

<P>Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said;

<P>but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,

<P>had she known how little offence it had given her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the middle of the day, they were visited
by Sir

<P>John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival

<P>of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey

<P>of the guest.&nbsp; With the assistance of his mother-in-law,

<P>Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of

<P>Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine

<P>of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but

<P>the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have

<P>prevented from being immediately sprung.&nbsp; But, as it was,

<P>she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far

<P>their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without
either

<P>inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink

<P>tea with them that evening.&nbsp; On the present occasion,

<P>for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards

<P>whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,

<P>he wished to engage them for both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You MUST drink tea with us to night," said
he,

<P>"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must

<P>absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.&nbsp;
"And who knows

<P>but you may raise a dance," said she.&nbsp; "And that will

<P>tempt YOU, Miss Marianne."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A dance!" cried Marianne.&nbsp; "Impossible!
Who is to dance?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers

<P>to be sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance

<P>because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish with all my soul," cried Sir John,

<P>"that Willoughby were among us again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions

<P>to Edward.&nbsp; "And who is Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice,

<P>to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave him a brief reply.&nbsp; Marianne's
countenance

<P>was more communicative.&nbsp; Edward saw enough to comprehend,

<P>not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's

<P>expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their

<P>visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,

<P>in a whisper, "I have been guessing.&nbsp; Shall I tell you

<P>my guess?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall I tell you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she
could

<P>not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,

<P>and after a moment's silence, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will
come

<P>I hope...I am sure you will like him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished

<P>at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it

<P>to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,

<P>founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby

<P>and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.
