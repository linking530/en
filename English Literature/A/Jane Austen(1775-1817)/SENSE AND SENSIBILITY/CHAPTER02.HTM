<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress

<P>of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded

<P>to the condition of visitors.&nbsp; As such, however, they were

<P>treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband

<P>with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody

<P>beyond himself, his wife, and their child.&nbsp; He really

<P>pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland

<P>as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible

<P>to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could

<P>accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,

<P>his invitation was accepted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A continuance in a place where everything reminded

<P>her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.

<P>In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful

<P>than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine

<P>expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.

<P>But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,

<P>and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was

<P>beyond alloy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of
what her

<P>husband intended to do for his sisters.&nbsp; To take three

<P>thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy

<P>would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.

<P>She begged him to think again on the subject.&nbsp; How could

<P>he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only

<P>child too, of so large a sum?&nbsp; And what possible claim

<P>could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by

<P>half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,

<P>have on his generosity to so large an amount.&nbsp; It was very

<P>well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist

<P>between the children of any man by different marriages;

<P>and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry,

<P>by giving away all his money to his half sisters?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was my father's last request to me," replied

<P>her husband, "that I should assist his widow and daughters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He did not know what he was talking of, I
dare say;

<P>ten to one but he was light-headed at the time.

<P>Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought

<P>of such a thing as begging you to give away half your

<P>fortune from your own child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He did not stipulate for any particular sum,

<P>my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,

<P>to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable

<P>than it was in his power to do.&nbsp; Perhaps it would

<P>have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.

<P>He could hardly suppose I should neglect them.

<P>But as he required the promise, I could not do less

<P>than give it; at least I thought so at the time.

<P>The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.

<P>Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland

<P>and settle in a new home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, LET something be done for them;

<P>but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.

<P>Consider," she added, "that when the money is once

<P>parted with, it never can return.&nbsp; Your sisters will marry,

<P>and it will be gone for ever.&nbsp; If, indeed, it could

<P>be restored to our poor little boy--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely,

<P>"that would make great difference.&nbsp; The time may come when

<P>Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.

<P>If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would

<P>be a very convenient addition."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure it would."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, then, it would be better for all
parties,

<P>if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds

<P>would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! beyond anything great!&nbsp; What brother
on earth

<P>would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY

<P>his sisters!&nbsp; And as it is--only half blood!--But you

<P>have such a generous spirit!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would not wish to do any thing mean," he
replied.

<P>"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than

<P>too little.&nbsp; No one, at least, can think I have not

<P>done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly

<P>expect more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no knowing what THEY may expect,"

<P>said the lady, "but we are not to think of their

<P>expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly--and I think I may afford to give
them five

<P>hundred pounds a-piece.&nbsp; As it is, without any addition

<P>of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds

<P>on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune

<P>for any young woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes
me that

<P>they can want no addition at all.&nbsp; They will have ten

<P>thousand pounds divided amongst them.&nbsp; If they marry,

<P>they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,

<P>they may all live very comfortably together on the interest

<P>of ten thousand pounds."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is very true, and, therefore, I do not
know whether,

<P>upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do

<P>something for their mother while she lives, rather than

<P>for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters

<P>would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.

<P>A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving

<P>her consent to this plan.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure," said she, "it is better than
parting with

<P>fifteen hundred pounds at once.&nbsp; But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood

<P>should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot

<P>be worth half that purchase."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly not; but if you observe, people
always

<P>live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;

<P>and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.

<P>An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over

<P>and over every year, and there is no getting rid

<P>of it.&nbsp; You are not aware of what you are doing.

<P>I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;

<P>for my mother was clogged with the payment of three

<P>to old superannuated servants by my father's will,

<P>and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.

<P>Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then

<P>there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one

<P>of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned

<P>out to be no such thing.&nbsp; My mother was quite sick of it.

<P>Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual

<P>claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,

<P>because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at

<P>my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.

<P>It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am

<P>sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for

<P>all the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied
Mr. Dashwood,

<P>"to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income.

<P>One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own.

<P>To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,

<P>on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away

<P>one's independence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks
for it.

<P>They think themselves secure, you do no more than what

<P>is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.&nbsp; If I were you,

<P>whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.

<P>I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.

<P>It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,

<P>or even fifty pounds from our own expenses."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe you are right, my love; it will
be better

<P>that there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I

<P>may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance

<P>than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge

<P>their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,

<P>and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end

<P>of the year.&nbsp; It will certainly be much the best way.

<P>A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent

<P>their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,

<P>be amply discharging my promise to my father."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure it will.&nbsp; Indeed, to say the
truth,

<P>I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea

<P>of your giving them any money at all.&nbsp; The assistance

<P>he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be

<P>reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking

<P>out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them

<P>to move their things, and sending them presents of fish

<P>and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.

<P>I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,

<P>it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.

<P>Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively

<P>comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live

<P>on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the

<P>thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings

<P>them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,

<P>they will pay their mother for their board out of it.

<P>Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,

<P>and what on earth can four women want for more than

<P>that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will

<P>be nothing at all.&nbsp; They will have no carriage, no horses,

<P>and hardly any servants; they will keep no company,

<P>and can have no expenses of any kind!&nbsp; Only conceive

<P>how comfortable they will be!&nbsp; Five hundred a year! I am

<P>sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;

<P>and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think

<P>of it.&nbsp; They will be much more able to give YOU something."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe
you

<P>are perfectly right.&nbsp; My father certainly could mean

<P>nothing more by his request to me than what you say.

<P>I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil

<P>my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness

<P>to them as you have described.&nbsp; When my mother removes

<P>into another house my services shall be readily given

<P>to accommodate her as far as I can.&nbsp; Some little present

<P>of furniture too may be acceptable then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood.&nbsp;
"But, however,

<P>ONE thing must be considered.&nbsp; When your father and mother

<P>moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill

<P>was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,

<P>and is now left to your mother.&nbsp; Her house will therefore

<P>be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a material consideration undoubtedly.

<P>A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would

<P>have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice

<P>as handsome as what belongs to this house.&nbsp; A great

<P>deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY

<P>can ever afford to live in.&nbsp; But, however, so it is.

<P>Your father thought only of THEM.&nbsp; And I must say this:

<P>that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention

<P>to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,

<P>he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This argument was irresistible.&nbsp; It gave
to his

<P>intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he

<P>finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,

<P>if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow

<P>and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly

<P>acts as his own wife pointed out.
