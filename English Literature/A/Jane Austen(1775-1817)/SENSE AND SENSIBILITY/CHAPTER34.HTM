<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in
her

<P>husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day

<P>both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her

<P>confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,

<P>even the woman with whom her sisters were staying,

<P>by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton,

<P>she found her one of the most charming women in the world!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs.
Dashwood.

<P>There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides,

<P>which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised

<P>with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,

<P>and a general want of understanding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same manners, however, which recommended
Mrs. John

<P>Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit

<P>the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing

<P>more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,

<P>who met her husband's sisters without any affection,

<P>and almost without having anything to say to them;

<P>for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street,

<P>she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor wanted very much to know, though she
did

<P>not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town;

<P>but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily

<P>to mention his name before her, till able to tell her

<P>that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on,

<P>or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon

<P>were answered; because she believed them still so very

<P>much attached to each other, that they could not be too

<P>sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.

<P>The intelligence however, which SHE would not give,

<P>soon flowed from another quarter.&nbsp; Lucy came very shortly

<P>to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward,

<P>though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.

<P>He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear

<P>of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,

<P>was not to be told, they could do nothing at present

<P>but write.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward assured them himself of his being in
town,

<P>within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.

<P>Twice was his card found on the table, when they returned

<P>from their morning's engagements.&nbsp; Elinor was pleased

<P>that he had called; and still more pleased that she had

<P>missed him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted

<P>with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit

<P>of giving anything, they determined to give them--

<P>a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,

<P>invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had

<P>taken a very good house for three months.&nbsp; Their sisters

<P>and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood

<P>was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad

<P>to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager

<P>civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.

<P>They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn

<P>whether her sons were to be of the party.&nbsp; The expectation

<P>of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested

<P>in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's

<P>mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised

<P>to attend such an introduction, though she could now see

<P>her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,

<P>her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars,

<P>her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest with which she thus anticipated
the

<P>party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully

<P>than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles

<P>were also to be at it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So well had they recommended themselves to
Lady Middleton,

<P>so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,

<P>that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her

<P>sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John

<P>to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street;

<P>and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss

<P>Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known,

<P>that their visit should begin a few days before the party

<P>took place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood,

<P>as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had

<P>had the care of her brother, might not have done much,

<P>however, towards procuring them seats at her table;

<P>but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,

<P>who had long wanted to be personally known to the family,

<P>to have a nearer view of their characters and her own

<P>difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring

<P>to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,

<P>than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Elinor its effect was very different.&nbsp;
She began

<P>immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with

<P>his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party

<P>given by his sister; and to see him for the first time,

<P>after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly

<P>knew how she could bear it!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded

<P>entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.

<P>They were relieved however, not by her own recollection,

<P>but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be

<P>inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her

<P>that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,

<P>and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther

<P>by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme

<P>affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they

<P>were together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important Tuesday came that was to introduce

<P>the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as
they

<P>walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived

<P>so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed

<P>the servant at the same time--"There is nobody here but

<P>you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.

<P>Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all

<P>my happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could have given her immediate relief

<P>by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother,

<P>rather than her own, whom they were about to behold;

<P>but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with

<P>great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter

<P>amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,

<P>hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,

<P>even to formality, in her figure, and serious,

<P>even to sourness, in her aspect.&nbsp; Her complexion was sallow;

<P>and her features small, without beauty, and naturally

<P>without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow

<P>had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,

<P>by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.

<P>She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people

<P>in general, she proportioned them to the number of

<P>her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,

<P>not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed

<P>with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this
behaviour.--

<P>A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it

<P>was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;--

<P>and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles,

<P>a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,

<P>only amused her.&nbsp; She could not but smile to see the graciousness

<P>of both mother and daughter towards the very person--

<P>for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,

<P>had they known as much as she did, they would have been most

<P>anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively

<P>no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.

<P>But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,

<P>she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from

<P>which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions

<P>with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance,

<P>without thoroughly despising them all four.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably

<P>distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed

<P>about Dr. Davis to be perfectly happy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner was a grand one, the servants were
numerous,

<P>and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination

<P>for show, and the Master's ability to support it.

<P>In spite of the improvements and additions which were

<P>making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner

<P>having once been within some thousand pounds of being

<P>obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom

<P>of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--

<P>no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--

<P>but there, the deficiency was considerable.&nbsp; John Dashwood

<P>had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,

<P>and his wife had still less.&nbsp; But there was no peculiar

<P>disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with

<P>the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured

<P>under one or other of these disqualifications for being

<P>agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want

<P>of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room

<P>after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,

<P>for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some

<P>variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,

<P>and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one

<P>subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,

<P>which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,

<P>and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were nearly

<P>of the same age.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had both the children been there, the affair
might

<P>have been determined too easily by measuring them at once;

<P>but as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural

<P>assertion on both sides; and every body had a right to

<P>be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it

<P>over and over again as often as they liked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties stood thus:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two mothers, though each really convinced
that

<P>her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour

<P>of the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two grandmothers, with not less partiality,

<P>but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support

<P>of their own descendant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please
one parent

<P>than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall

<P>for their age, and could not conceive that there could

<P>be the smallest difference in the world between them;

<P>and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,

<P>as fast as she could, in favour of each.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on

<P>William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and

<P>Fanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing

<P>it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called

<P>on for her's, offended them all, by declaring that she

<P>had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had
painted

<P>a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law,

<P>which being now just mounted and brought home,

<P>ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,

<P>catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following

<P>the other gentlemen into the room, were officiously

<P>handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are done by my eldest sister," said
he; "and you,

<P>as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.

<P>I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any

<P>of her performances before, but she is in general reckoned

<P>to draw extremely well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions

<P>to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he

<P>would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood;

<P>and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited,

<P>they were handed round for general inspection.

<P>Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work,

<P>particularly requested to look at them; and after they had

<P>received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation,

<P>Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing

<P>her, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hum"--said Mrs. Ferrars--"very pretty,"--and
without

<P>regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her
mother

<P>had been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little,

<P>she immediately said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?" But
then again,

<P>the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself,

<P>probably came over her, for she presently added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not think they are something in Miss

<P>Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most

<P>delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beautifully indeed!&nbsp; But SHE does every
thing well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne could not bear this.--She was already

<P>greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed

<P>praise of another, at Elinor's expense, though she

<P>had not any notion of what was principally meant by it,

<P>provoked her immediately to say with warmth,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is admiration of a very particular kind!--

<P>what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, or who cares,

<P>for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so saying, she took the screens out of
her

<P>sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they

<P>ought to be admired.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and
drawing

<P>herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort

<P>this bitter philippic, "Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband
was

<P>all in a fright at his sister's audacity.&nbsp; Elinor was

<P>much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been

<P>by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they

<P>were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only

<P>what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could

<P>not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's feelings did not stop here.&nbsp;
The cold

<P>insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister,

<P>seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses

<P>to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think

<P>of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of

<P>affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment,

<P>to her sister's chair, and putting one arm round her neck,

<P>and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager,

<P>voice,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them.&nbsp;
Don't let them

<P>make YOU unhappy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could say no more; her spirits were quite
overcome,

<P>and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst

<P>into tears.&nbsp; Every body's attention was called, and almost

<P>every body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went

<P>to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs. Jennings,

<P>with a very intelligent "Ah! poor dear," immediately gave

<P>her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged

<P>against the author of this nervous distress, that he

<P>instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele,

<P>and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole

<P>shocking affair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered

<P>enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among

<P>the rest; though her spirits retained the impression

<P>of what had passed, the whole evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel
Brandon,

<P>in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,--

<P>"She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very

<P>nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must

<P>allow that there is something very trying to a young woman

<P>who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions.

<P>You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably

<P>handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--

<P>Now you see it is all gone."
