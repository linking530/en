<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with
tolerable

<P>comfort to themselves.&nbsp; The house and the garden, with all

<P>the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,

<P>and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland

<P>half its charms were engaged in again with far greater

<P>enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the

<P>loss of their father.&nbsp; Sir John Middleton, who called

<P>on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was

<P>not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,

<P>could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their visitors, except those from Barton Park,

<P>were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties

<P>that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated

<P>assurances of his carriage being always at their service,

<P>the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the

<P>wish of society for her children; and she was resolute

<P>in declining to visit any family beyond the distance

<P>of a walk.&nbsp; There were but few who could be so classed;

<P>and it was not all of them that were attainable.

<P>About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow

<P>winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,

<P>as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their

<P>earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking

<P>mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,

<P>interested their imagination and made them wish to be

<P>better acquainted with it.&nbsp; But they learnt, on enquiry,

<P>that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,

<P>was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,

<P>and never stirred from home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole country about them abounded in beautiful
walks.

<P>The high downs which invited them from almost every window

<P>of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air

<P>on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt

<P>of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;

<P>and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret

<P>one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the

<P>partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear

<P>the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding

<P>days had occasioned.&nbsp; The weather was not tempting enough

<P>to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,

<P>in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would

<P>be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would

<P>be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in
their own

<P>penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they

<P>caught in their faces the animating gales of a high

<P>south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented

<P>their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne,

<P>"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least

<P>two hours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way
against

<P>the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about

<P>twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over

<P>their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--

<P>Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,

<P>to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.

<P>One consolation however remained for them, to which the

<P>exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;

<P>it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep

<P>side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set off.&nbsp; Marianne had at first the
advantage,

<P>but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;

<P>and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,

<P>was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom

<P>in safety.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers

<P>playing round him, was passing up the hill and within

<P>a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.

<P>He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.&nbsp; She had

<P>raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been

<P>twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.

<P>The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her

<P>modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,

<P>took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried

<P>her down the hill.&nbsp; Then passing through the garden,

<P>the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her

<P>directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,

<P>and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair

<P>in the parlour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement
at

<P>their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed

<P>on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration

<P>which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized

<P>for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner

<P>so frank and so graceful that his person, which was

<P>uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice

<P>and expression.&nbsp; Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,

<P>the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would

<P>have been secured by any act of attention to her child;

<P>but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,

<P>gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thanked him again and again; and, with
a sweetness

<P>of address which always attended her, invited him to

<P>be seated.&nbsp; But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.

<P>His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present

<P>home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would

<P>allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire

<P>after Miss Dashwood.&nbsp; The honour was readily granted,

<P>and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,

<P>in the midst of an heavy rain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness

<P>were instantly the theme of general admiration,

<P>and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne

<P>received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--

<P>Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,

<P>for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his

<P>lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding

<P>him after their entering the house.&nbsp; But she had seen

<P>enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,

<P>and with an energy which always adorned her praise.

<P>His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever

<P>drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying

<P>her into the house with so little previous formality, there

<P>was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended

<P>the action to her.&nbsp; Every circumstance belonging to him

<P>was interesting.&nbsp; His name was good, his residence was in

<P>their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all

<P>manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.

<P>Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,

<P>and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John called on them as soon as the next
interval

<P>of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out

<P>of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him,

<P>he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman

<P>of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Willoughby!" cried Sir John; "what, is HE

<P>in the country? That is good news however; I will

<P>ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know him! to be sure I do.&nbsp; Why, he is
down here

<P>every year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what sort of a young man is he?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I
assure you.

<P>A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider

<P>in England."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And is that all you can say for him?" cried
Marianne,

<P>indignantly.&nbsp; "But what are his manners on more intimate

<P>acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John was rather puzzled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much
about him

<P>as to all THAT.&nbsp; But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,

<P>and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer

<P>I ever saw.&nbsp; Was she out with him today?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to
the

<P>colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could

<P>describe to her the shades of his mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But who is he?" said Elinor.&nbsp; "Where
does he come

<P>from?&nbsp; Has he a house at Allenham?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this point Sir John could give more certain
intelligence;

<P>and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property

<P>of his own in the country; that he resided there only

<P>while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,

<P>to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was

<P>to inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth

<P>catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty

<P>little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;

<P>and if I were you, I would not give him up to my

<P>younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.

<P>Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.

<P>Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with
a

<P>good humoured smile, "that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded

<P>by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what

<P>you call CATCHING him.&nbsp; It is not an employment to which

<P>they have been brought up.&nbsp; Men are very safe with us,

<P>let them be ever so rich.&nbsp; I am glad to find, however,

<P>from what you say, that he is a respectable young man,

<P>and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,

<P>as ever lived," repeated Sir John.&nbsp; "I remember

<P>last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced

<P>from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling
eyes,

<P>"and with elegance, with spirit?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride
to covert."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is what I like; that is what a young
man ought

<P>to be.&nbsp; Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them

<P>should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye, I see how it will be," said Sir
John, "I see

<P>how it will be.&nbsp; You will be setting your cap at him now,

<P>and never think of poor Brandon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne,

<P>warmly, "which I particularly dislike.&nbsp; I abhor every

<P>common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting

<P>one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most

<P>odious of all.&nbsp; Their tendency is gross and illiberal;

<P>and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,

<P>time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John did not much understand this reproof;

<P>but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare
say,

<P>one way or other.&nbsp; Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,

<P>and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can

<P>tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining

<P>of ankles."
