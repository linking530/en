<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined

<P>when they first came into Devonshire, that so many

<P>engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly

<P>presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent

<P>invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little

<P>leisure for serious employment.&nbsp; Yet such was the case.

<P>When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home

<P>and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,

<P>were put into execution.&nbsp; The private balls at the park

<P>then began; and parties on the water were made and

<P>accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.

<P>In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;

<P>and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended

<P>these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing

<P>intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford

<P>him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,

<P>of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,

<P>in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance

<P>of her affection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.

<P>She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once

<P>or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some

<P>self-command to Marianne.&nbsp; But Marianne abhorred all

<P>concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;

<P>and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not

<P>in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely

<P>an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection

<P>of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.

<P>Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at

<P>all times, was an illustration of their opinions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was present she had no eyes for any
one else.

<P>Every thing he did, was right.&nbsp; Every thing he said, was clever.

<P>If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,

<P>he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get

<P>her a good hand.&nbsp; If dancing formed the amusement

<P>of the night, they were partners for half the time;

<P>and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,

<P>were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word

<P>to any body else.&nbsp; Such conduct made them of course

<P>most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,

<P>and seemed hardly to provoke them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings
with

<P>a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this

<P>excessive display of them.&nbsp; To her it was but the natural

<P>consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the season of happiness to Marianne.

<P>Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment

<P>to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,

<P>was more likely to be softened than she had thought it

<P>possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed

<P>on her present home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's happiness was not so great.&nbsp;
Her heart was not

<P>so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements

<P>so pure.&nbsp; They afforded her no companion that could make

<P>amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach

<P>her to think of Norland with less regret than ever.

<P>Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply

<P>to her the conversation she missed; although the latter

<P>was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded

<P>her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of

<P>her discourse.&nbsp; She had already repeated her own history

<P>to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been

<P>equal to her means of improvement, she might have known

<P>very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of

<P>Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what he said to his wife

<P>a few minutes before he died.&nbsp; Lady Middleton was more

<P>agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.

<P>Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her

<P>reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense

<P>had nothing to do.&nbsp; Towards her husband and mother she

<P>was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore

<P>neither to be looked for nor desired.&nbsp; She had nothing

<P>to say one day that she had not said the day before.

<P>Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were

<P>always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties

<P>arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted

<P>in style and her two eldest children attended her,

<P>she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them

<P>than she might have experienced in sitting at home;--

<P>and so little did her presence add to the pleasure

<P>of the others, by any share in their conversation,

<P>that they were sometimes only reminded of her being

<P>amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,

<P>did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the

<P>respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,

<P>or give pleasure as a companion.&nbsp; Willoughby was out

<P>of the question.&nbsp; Her admiration and regard, even her

<P>sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;

<P>his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less

<P>agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.

<P>Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such

<P>encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing

<P>with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the

<P>indifference of her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she
had reason

<P>to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already

<P>been known to him.&nbsp; This suspicion was given by some words

<P>which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,

<P>when they were sitting down together by mutual consent,

<P>while the others were dancing.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed

<P>on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,

<P>he said, with a faint smile, "Your sister, I understand,

<P>does not approve of second attachments."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied Elinor, "her opinions are all
romantic."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or rather, as I believe, she considers them

<P>impossible to exist."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe she does.&nbsp; But how she contrives
it

<P>without reflecting on the character of her own father,

<P>who had himself two wives, I know not.&nbsp; A few years

<P>however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis

<P>of common sense and observation; and then they may be

<P>more easy to define and to justify than they now are,

<P>by any body but herself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will probably be the case," he replied;

<P>"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices

<P>of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way

<P>to the reception of more general opinions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor.

<P>"There are inconveniences attending such feelings

<P>as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and

<P>ignorance of the world cannot atone for.&nbsp; Her systems have

<P>all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;

<P>and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look

<P>forward to as her greatest possible advantage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short pause he resumed the conversation

<P>by saying,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your sister make no distinction in her
objections

<P>against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal

<P>in every body?&nbsp; Are those who have been disappointed

<P>in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy

<P>of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,

<P>to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the
minutiae

<P>of her principles.&nbsp; I only know that I never yet heard her

<P>admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change,

<P>a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;

<P>for when the romantic refinements of a young mind

<P>are obliged to give way, how frequently are they

<P>succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too

<P>dangerous!&nbsp; I speak from experience.&nbsp; I once knew a lady

<P>who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,

<P>who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced

<P>change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances"--

<P>Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said

<P>too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,

<P>which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.

<P>The lady would probably have passed without suspicion,

<P>had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned

<P>her ought not to escape his lips.&nbsp; As it was,

<P>it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his

<P>emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.

<P>Elinor attempted no more.&nbsp; But Marianne, in her place,

<P>would not have done so little.&nbsp; The whole story would

<P>have been speedily formed under her active imagination;

<P>and every thing established in the most melancholy order

<P>of disastrous love.
