<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs.
Ferrars,

<P>just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that

<P>reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,

<P>the reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted

<P>to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.

<P>For many years of her life she had had two sons;

<P>but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago,

<P>had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert

<P>had left her for a fortnight without any; and now,

<P>by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of his being allowed once more to
live,

<P>however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence

<P>secure, till he had revealed his present engagement;

<P>for the publication of that circumstance, he feared,

<P>might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry

<P>him off as rapidly as before.&nbsp; With apprehensive caution

<P>therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with

<P>unexpected calmness.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably

<P>endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,

<P>by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton

<P>he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--

<P>and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton

<P>was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,

<P>while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private

<P>gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,

<P>though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,

<P>he was by no means inclined to be guided by it,

<P>she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,

<P>to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay

<P>as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent

<P>every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree

<P>of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she would engage to do towards augmenting

<P>their income was next to be considered; and here it

<P>plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,

<P>he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was

<P>inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,

<P>not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking

<P>orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;

<P>nor was anything promised either for the present or in future,

<P>beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as much, however, as was desired,

<P>and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor;

<P>and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,

<P>seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an income quite sufficient to their wants

<P>thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for

<P>after Edward was in possession of the living, but the

<P>readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,

<P>with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,

<P>was making considerable improvements; and after waiting

<P>some time for their completion, after experiencing,

<P>as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays

<P>from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,

<P>as usual, broke through the first positive resolution

<P>of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the

<P>ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first month after their marriage was spent

<P>with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence

<P>they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,

<P>and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--

<P>could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.

<P>Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together,

<P>were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward

<P>and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she

<P>found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,

<P>one of the happiest couples in the world.&nbsp; They had

<P>in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel

<P>Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for

<P>their cows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were visited on their first settling by
almost

<P>all their relations and friends.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars came

<P>to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed

<P>of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at

<P>the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not say that I am disappointed, my
dear sister,"

<P>said John, as they were walking together one morning before

<P>the gates of Delaford House, "THAT would be saying too much,

<P>for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young

<P>women in the world, as it is.&nbsp; But, I confess, it would

<P>give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.

<P>His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in

<P>such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I

<P>have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there

<P>is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,

<P>Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--

<P>yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to

<P>have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel

<P>Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what

<P>may happen--for, when people are much thrown together,

<P>and see little of anybody else--and it will always be

<P>in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--

<P>in short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand me."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them,
and always

<P>treated them with the make-believe of decent affection,

<P>they were never insulted by her real favour and preference.

<P>THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning

<P>of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months

<P>had passed away.&nbsp; The selfish sagacity of the latter,

<P>which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,

<P>was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;

<P>for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,

<P>and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening

<P>was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars

<P>to his choice, and re-established him completely in

<P>her favour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair,

<P>and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held

<P>forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,

<P>an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress

<P>may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every

<P>advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time

<P>and conscience.&nbsp; When Robert first sought her acquaintance,

<P>and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings,

<P>it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.

<P>He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;

<P>and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection

<P>of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews

<P>would settle the matter.&nbsp; In that point, however,

<P>and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him

<P>hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,

<P>another visit, another conversation, was always wanted

<P>to produce this conviction.&nbsp; Some doubts always lingered

<P>in her mind when they parted, which could only be

<P>removed by another half hour's discourse with himself.

<P>His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest

<P>followed in course.&nbsp; Instead of talking of Edward,

<P>they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject

<P>on which he had always more to say than on any other,

<P>and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal

<P>to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident

<P>to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.

<P>He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,

<P>and very proud of marrying privately without his

<P>mother's consent.&nbsp; What immediately followed is known.

<P>They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;

<P>for she had many relations and old acquaintances to

<P>cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--

<P>and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness

<P>of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,

<P>which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted.&nbsp; The forgiveness,

<P>at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;

<P>and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore

<P>could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks

<P>longer unpardoned.&nbsp; But perseverance in humility of conduct

<P>and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence,

<P>and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,

<P>procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame

<P>her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid

<P>degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.

<P>Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert

<P>or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven

<P>for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,

<P>though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken

<P>of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered,

<P>and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.

<P>They settled in town, received very liberal assistance

<P>from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable

<P>with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies

<P>and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,

<P>in which their husbands of course took a part, as well

<P>as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and

<P>Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which

<P>they all lived together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Edward had done to forfeit the right of
eldest

<P>son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what

<P>Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them

<P>still more.&nbsp; It was an arrangement, however, justified in

<P>its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever

<P>appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give

<P>a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,

<P>as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing

<P>himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from

<P>the ready discharge of his duties in every particular,

<P>from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,

<P>and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,

<P>he might be supposed no less contented with his lot,

<P>no less free from every wish of an exchange.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's marriage divided her as little from
her

<P>family as could well be contrived, without rendering

<P>the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother

<P>and sisters spent much more than half their time with her.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well

<P>as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;

<P>for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together

<P>was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than

<P>what John had expressed.&nbsp; It was now her darling object.

<P>Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,

<P>she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant

<P>enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at

<P>the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.

<P>They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,

<P>and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward

<P>of all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a confederacy against her--with a
knowledge

<P>so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond

<P>attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it

<P>was observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she do?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary
fate.

<P>She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,

<P>and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.

<P>She was born to overcome an affection formed so late

<P>in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment

<P>superior to strong esteem and lively friendship,

<P>voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,

<P>a man who had suffered no less than herself under the

<P>event of a former attachment, whom, two years before,

<P>she had considered too old to be married,--and who still

<P>sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so it was.&nbsp; Instead of falling a sacrifice

<P>to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly

<P>flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining

<P>even for ever with her mother, and finding her only

<P>pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her

<P>more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--

<P>she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,

<P>entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,

<P>the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those
who best

<P>loved him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he

<P>was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her

<P>society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits

<P>to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness

<P>in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight

<P>of each observing friend.&nbsp; Marianne could never love

<P>by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much

<P>devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without

<P>a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete

<P>in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating

<P>his marriage with a woman of character, as the source

<P>of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he

<P>behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have

<P>been happy and rich.&nbsp; That his repentance of misconduct,

<P>which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,

<P>need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel

<P>Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.&nbsp; But that

<P>he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,

<P>or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a

<P>broken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.

<P>He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.

<P>His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home

<P>always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,

<P>and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable

<P>degree of domestic felicity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility

<P>in surviving her loss--he always retained that decided

<P>regard which interested him in every thing that befell her,

<P>and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--

<P>and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in

<P>after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain
at the cottage,

<P>without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for

<P>Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,

<P>Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,

<P>and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between Barton and Delaford, there was that
constant

<P>communication which strong family affection would

<P>naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness

<P>of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least

<P>considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within

<P>sight of each other, they could live without disagreement

<P>between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.
