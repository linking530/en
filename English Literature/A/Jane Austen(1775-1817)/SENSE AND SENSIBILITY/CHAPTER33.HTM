<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some opposition, Marianne yielded to
her

<P>sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her

<P>and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour. She

<P>expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits,

<P>and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in

<P>Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation

<P>for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings
recollected

<P>that there was a lady at the other end of the street

<P>on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business

<P>at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends

<P>transacted their's, she should pay her visit and

<P>return for them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods
found

<P>so many people before them in the room, that there was

<P>not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they

<P>were obliged to wait.&nbsp; All that could be done was, to sit

<P>down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the

<P>quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there,

<P>and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope

<P>of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.

<P>But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy

<P>of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.

<P>He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself,

<P>and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined,

<P>all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter

<P>of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,

<P>were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had

<P>no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies,

<P>than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares;

<P>a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor

<P>the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,

<P>natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in

<P>the first style of fashion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings

<P>of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination

<P>of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner

<P>in deciding on all the different horrors of the different

<P>toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining

<P>unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect

<P>her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was

<P>passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last the affair was decided.&nbsp; The ivory,

<P>the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment,

<P>and the gentleman having named the last day on which his

<P>existence could be continued without the possession of the

<P>toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care,

<P>and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such

<P>a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration,

<P>walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor lost no time in bringing her business
forward,

<P>was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman

<P>presented himself at her side.&nbsp; She turned her eyes towards

<P>his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their affection and pleasure in meeting was
just enough

<P>to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop.

<P>John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see

<P>his sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction;

<P>and his inquiries after their mother were respectful

<P>and attentive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in
town

<P>two days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,"

<P>said he, "but it was impossible, for we were obliged

<P>to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange;

<P>and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.

<P>Harry was vastly pleased.&nbsp; THIS morning I had fully intended

<P>to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour,

<P>but one has always so much to do on first coming to town.

<P>I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal.&nbsp; But tomorrow I

<P>think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street,

<P>and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.

<P>I understand she is a woman of very good fortune.

<P>And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM.

<P>As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be happy to show

<P>them every respect.&nbsp; They are excellent neighbours to you in

<P>the country, I understand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excellent indeed.&nbsp; Their attention to
our comfort,

<P>their friendliness in every particular, is more than I

<P>can express."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word;

<P>extremely glad indeed.&nbsp; But so it ought to be; they are

<P>people of large fortune, they are related to you, and

<P>every civility and accommodation that can serve to make

<P>your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.

<P>And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage

<P>and want for nothing!&nbsp; Edward brought us a most charming

<P>account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind,

<P>he said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond

<P>any thing.&nbsp; It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it,

<P>I assure you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother;

<P>and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him,

<P>by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell

<P>her that his mistress waited for them at the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was
introduced

<P>to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating

<P>his hope of being able to call on them the next day,

<P>took leave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His visit was duly paid.&nbsp; He came with
a pretence at

<P>an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;

<P>"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really

<P>she had no leisure for going any where."&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings,

<P>however, assured him directly, that she should not stand

<P>upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something

<P>like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John

<P>Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.

<P>His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind;

<P>to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel

<P>Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a

<P>curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know

<P>him to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After staying with them half an hour, he asked

<P>Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce

<P>him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.&nbsp; The weather was

<P>remarkably fine, and she readily consented.&nbsp; As soon

<P>as they were out of the house, his enquiries began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Colonel Brandon?&nbsp; Is he a man
of fortune?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am glad of it.&nbsp; He seems a most gentlemanlike
man;

<P>and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect

<P>of a very respectable establishment in life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me, brother! what do you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He likes you.&nbsp; I observed him narrowly,
and am

<P>convinced of it.&nbsp; What is the amount of his fortune?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe about two thousand a year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two thousand a-year;" and then working himself

<P>up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,

<P>"Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much,

<P>for your sake."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed I believe you," replied Elinor; "but
I am

<P>very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish

<P>of marrying ME."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much
mistaken.

<P>A very little trouble on your side secures him.

<P>Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness

<P>of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends

<P>may all advise him against it.&nbsp; But some of those little

<P>attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily

<P>give will fix him, in spite of himself.&nbsp; And there can be

<P>no reason why you should not try for him.&nbsp; It is not to be

<P>supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,

<P>you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite

<P>out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--

<P>you have too much sense not to see all that.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon

<P>must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on

<P>my part to make him pleased with you and your family.

<P>It is a match that must give universal satisfaction.

<P>In short, it is a kind of thing that"--lowering his voice

<P>to an important whisper--"will be exceedingly welcome

<P>to ALL PARTIES." Recollecting himself, however, he added,

<P>"That is, I mean to say--your friends are all truly

<P>anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly,

<P>for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.

<P>And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,

<P>I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much

<P>the other day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be something remarkable, now," he
continued,

<P>"something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I

<P>a sister settling at the same time.&nbsp; And yet it is not

<P>very unlikely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, with
resolution,

<P>"going to be married?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not actually settled, but there is such

<P>a thing in agitation.&nbsp; He has a most excellent mother.

<P>Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,

<P>and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match

<P>takes place.&nbsp; The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter

<P>of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.

<P>A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not

<P>a doubt of its taking place in time.&nbsp; A thousand a-year

<P>is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over

<P>for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.&nbsp; To give

<P>you another instance of her liberality:--The other day,

<P>as soon as we came to town, aware that money could

<P>not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes

<P>into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.

<P>And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great

<P>expense while we are here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused for her assent and compassion; and
she

<P>forced herself to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your expenses both in town and country must
certainly

<P>be considerable; but your income is a large one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.

<P>I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly

<P>a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.

<P>The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,

<P>is a most serious drain.&nbsp; And then I have made a little

<P>purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,

<P>you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.

<P>The land was so very desirable for me in every respect,

<P>so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it

<P>my duty to buy it.&nbsp; I could not have answered it to my

<P>conscience to let it fall into any other hands.&nbsp; A man must

<P>pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal

<P>of money."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More than you think it really and intrinsically
worth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, I hope not that.&nbsp; I might have sold
it again,

<P>the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the

<P>purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed;

<P>for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not

<P>happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands,

<P>I must have sold out to very great loss."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could only smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other great and inevitable expenses too we
have

<P>had on first coming to Norland.&nbsp; Our respected father,

<P>as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects

<P>that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)

<P>to your mother.&nbsp; Far be it from me to repine at his

<P>doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his

<P>own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,

<P>we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,

<P>china, &amp;c. to supply the place of what was taken away.

<P>You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we

<P>must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's

<P>kindness is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," said Elinor; "and assisted by
her liberality,

<P>I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Another year or two may do much towards it,"

<P>he gravely replied; "but however there is still a great

<P>deal to be done.&nbsp; There is not a stone laid of Fanny's

<P>green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden

<P>marked out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the green-house to be?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon the knoll behind the house.&nbsp; The
old

<P>walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.

<P>It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,

<P>and the flower-garden will slope down just before it,

<P>and be exceedingly pretty.&nbsp; We have cleared away all the old

<P>thorns that grew in patches over the brow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor kept her concern and her censure to
herself;

<P>and was very thankful that Marianne was not present,

<P>to share the provocation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having now said enough to make his poverty
clear,

<P>and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings

<P>for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's

<P>his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to

<P>congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her
house,

<P>her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;

<P>and it is an acquaintance that has not only been

<P>of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove

<P>materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is

<P>certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it

<P>speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all

<P>probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--

<P>She must have a great deal to leave."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for
she has

<P>only her jointure, which will descend to her children."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is not to be imagined that she lives
up to

<P>her income.&nbsp; Few people of common prudence will do THAT;

<P>and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And do you not think it more likely that she

<P>should leave it to her daughters, than to us?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her daughters are both exceedingly well married,

<P>and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her

<P>remembering them farther.&nbsp; Whereas, in my opinion, by her

<P>taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this

<P>kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her

<P>future consideration, which a conscientious woman would

<P>not disregard.&nbsp; Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;

<P>and she can hardly do all this, without being aware

<P>of the expectation it raises."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she raises none in those most concerned.

<P>Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity

<P>carries you too far."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, to be sure," said he, seeming to recollect
himself,

<P>"people have little, have very little in their power.

<P>But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--

<P>she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown

<P>quite thin.&nbsp; Is she ill?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint

<P>on her for several weeks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry for that.&nbsp; At her time of
life,

<P>any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!

<P>Her's has been a very short one!&nbsp; She was as handsome a girl

<P>last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract

<P>the man.&nbsp; There was something in her style of beauty,

<P>to please them particularly.&nbsp; I remember Fanny used to say

<P>that she would marry sooner and better than you did;

<P>not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it

<P>happened to strike her.&nbsp; She will be mistaken, however.

<P>I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth

<P>more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,

<P>and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better.

<P>Dorsetshire!&nbsp; I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear

<P>Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;

<P>and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself

<P>among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tried very seriously to convince him
that

<P>there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon;

<P>but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself

<P>to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking

<P>an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage

<P>by every possible attention.&nbsp; He had just compunction

<P>enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,

<P>to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should

<P>do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,

<P>or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means

<P>of atoning for his own neglect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton

<P>at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.

<P>Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.&nbsp; Sir John

<P>was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did

<P>not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him

<P>down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton

<P>saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his

<P>acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away

<P>delighted with both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall have a charming account to carry

<P>to Fanny," said he, as he walked back with his sister.

<P>"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!&nbsp; Such

<P>a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.

<P>And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,

<P>though not so elegant as her daughter.&nbsp; Your sister need

<P>not have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say

<P>the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally;

<P>for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man

<P>who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and

<P>Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither

<P>she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny

<P>would like to associate with.&nbsp; But now I can carry her

<P>a most satisfactory account of both."
