<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this open weather holds much longer," said
Mrs. Jennings,

<P>when they met at breakfast the following morning,

<P>"Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;

<P>'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure.

<P>Poor souls!&nbsp; I always pity them when they do; they seem

<P>to take it so much to heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is true," cried Marianne, in a cheerful
voice,

<P>and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.

<P>"I had not thought of that.&nbsp; This weather will keep many

<P>sportsmen in the country."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits
were

<P>restored by it.&nbsp; "It is charming weather for THEM indeed,"

<P>she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table

<P>with a happy countenance.&nbsp; "How much they must enjoy

<P>it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot

<P>be expected to last long.&nbsp; At this time of the year,

<P>and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly

<P>have very little more of it.&nbsp; Frosts will soon set in,

<P>and in all probability with severity.&nbsp; In another day

<P>or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last

<P>longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At any rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent

<P>Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly

<P>as she did, "I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady

<P>Middleton in town by the end of next week."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.&nbsp;
Mary always

<P>has her own way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And now," silently conjectured Elinor, "she
will

<P>write to Combe by this day's post."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if she DID, the letter was written and
sent away

<P>with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain

<P>the fact.&nbsp; Whatever the truth of it might be, and far

<P>as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,

<P>yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be

<P>very uncomfortable herself.&nbsp; And Marianne was in spirits;

<P>happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier

<P>in her expectation of a frost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards
at

<P>the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform

<P>them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time

<P>busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the

<P>variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you find it colder than it was in the
morning,

<P>Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.

<P>I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.&nbsp; It was

<P>not so yesterday, I think.&nbsp; The clouds seem parting too,

<P>the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a

<P>clear afternoon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was alternately diverted and pained;

<P>but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the

<P>brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance

<P>of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to
be

<P>dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set

<P>of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,

<P>which was invariably kind.&nbsp; Every thing in her household

<P>arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,

<P>and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady

<P>Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited

<P>no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose

<P>the feelings of her young companions.&nbsp; Pleased to find

<P>herself more comfortably situated in that particular than

<P>she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound

<P>for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their

<P>evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,

<P>formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation

<P>to the house, was with them almost every day; he came

<P>to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived

<P>more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any

<P>other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time

<P>with much concern his continued regard for her sister.

<P>She feared it was a strengthening regard.&nbsp; It grieved her

<P>to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,

<P>and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a week after their arrival, it became

<P>certain that Willoughby was also arrived.&nbsp; His card

<P>was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good God!" cried Marianne, "he has been here
while

<P>we were out."&nbsp; Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his

<P>being in London, now ventured to say, "Depend upon it,

<P>he will call again tomorrow."&nbsp; But Marianne seemed

<P>hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,

<P>escaped with the precious card.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event, while it raised the spirits of
Elinor,

<P>restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,

<P>their former agitation.&nbsp; From this moment her mind was

<P>never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour

<P>of the day, made her unfit for any thing.&nbsp; She insisted

<P>on being left behind, the next morning, when the others

<P>went out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be
passing

<P>in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's

<P>glance at her sister when they returned was enough to

<P>inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.

<P>A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily
forward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am, for my mistress."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly
up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor,

<P>unable to be longer silent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a little--not much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short pause.&nbsp; "You have no confidence

<P>in me, Marianne."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who
have

<P>confidence in no one!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me!" returned Elinor in some confusion; "indeed,

<P>Marianne, I have nothing to tell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nor I," answered Marianne with energy, "our
situations

<P>then are alike.&nbsp; We have neither of us any thing to tell;

<P>you, because you do not communicate, and I, because

<P>I conceal nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve
in herself,

<P>which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,

<P>under such circumstances, to press for greater openness

<P>in Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being

<P>given her, she read it aloud.&nbsp; It was from Lady Middleton,

<P>announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,

<P>and requesting the company of her mother and cousins

<P>the following evening.&nbsp; Business on Sir John's part,

<P>and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling

<P>in Berkeley Street.&nbsp; The invitation was accepted;

<P>but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as

<P>it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they

<P>should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some

<P>difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still

<P>she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was

<P>not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling

<P>to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor found, when the evening was over,

<P>that disposition is not materially altered by a change

<P>of abode, for although scarcely settled in town,

<P>Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty

<P>young people, and to amuse them with a ball.&nbsp; This was

<P>an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.

<P>In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;

<P>but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more

<P>important and less easily attained, it was risking too much

<P>for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that

<P>Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,

<P>with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from
the former,

<P>whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,

<P>as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention

<P>to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,

<P>they received no mark of recognition on their entrance.

<P>He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know

<P>who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from

<P>the other side of the room.&nbsp; Marianne gave one glance

<P>round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE

<P>was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed

<P>to receive or communicate pleasure.&nbsp; After they had been

<P>assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards

<P>the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them

<P>in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed

<P>of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said

<P>something very droll on hearing that they were to come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you were both in Devonshire," said
he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you?" replied Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you go back again?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not know." And thus ended their discourse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance

<P>in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much

<P>fatigued by the exercise.&nbsp; She complained of it

<P>as they returned to Berkeley Street.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye," said Mrs. Jennings, "we know the
reason

<P>of all that very well; if a certain person who shall

<P>be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a

<P>bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty

<P>of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Invited!" cried Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems
Sir

<P>John met him somewhere in the street this morning."

<P>Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.

<P>Impatient in this situation to be doing something

<P>that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved

<P>to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped

<P>by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,

<P>to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;

<P>and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure

<P>by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne

<P>was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose

<P>it to be to any other person.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings
went out by

<P>herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,

<P>while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious

<P>for conversation, walked from one window to the other,

<P>or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.

<P>Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,

<P>relating all that had passed, her suspicions of

<P>Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea

<P>of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account

<P>of her real situation with respect to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap

<P>foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.

<P>Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated

<P>company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.

<P>He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing

<P>satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he

<P>had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some

<P>time without saying a word.&nbsp; Elinor, persuaded that he

<P>had some communication to make in which her sister

<P>was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.

<P>It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind

<P>of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with

<P>the observation of "your sister looks unwell to-day,"

<P>or "your sister seems out of spirits," he had appeared

<P>on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,

<P>something particular about her.&nbsp; After a pause of several

<P>minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her

<P>in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate

<P>her on the acquisition of a brother?&nbsp; Elinor was not

<P>prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,

<P>was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,

<P>of asking what he meant?&nbsp; He tried to smile as he replied,

<P>"your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It cannot be generally known," returned Elinor,

<P>"for her own family do not know it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon,

<P>I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not

<P>supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,

<P>and their marriage is universally talked of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can that be? By whom can you have heard

<P>it mentioned?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By many--by some of whom you know nothing,
by others

<P>with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,

<P>and the Middletons.&nbsp; But still I might not have believed it,

<P>for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to

<P>be convinced, it will always find something to support

<P>its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,

<P>accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to

<P>Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.&nbsp; I came to inquire,

<P>but I was convinced before I could ask the question.

<P>Is every thing finally settled?&nbsp; Is it impossible to-?

<P>But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.

<P>Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.&nbsp; I believe I have been wrong

<P>in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on

<P>your prudence I have the strongest dependence.&nbsp; Tell me

<P>that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,

<P>that in short concealment, if concealment be possible,

<P>is all that remains."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct
avowal

<P>of his love for her sister, affected her very much.

<P>She was not immediately able to say anything, and even

<P>when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short

<P>time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.

<P>The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister

<P>was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring

<P>to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much

<P>as too little.&nbsp; Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's

<P>affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel

<P>Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection

<P>might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct

<P>from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,

<P>after some consideration, to say more than she really knew

<P>or believed.&nbsp; She acknowledged, therefore, that though

<P>she had never been informed by themselves of the terms

<P>on which they stood with each other, of their mutual

<P>affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence

<P>she was not astonished to hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He listened to her with silent attention, and
on

<P>her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,

<P>and after saying in a voice of emotion, "to your sister

<P>I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he

<P>may endeavour to deserve her,"--took leave, and went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from
this

<P>conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on

<P>other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a

<P>melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness,

<P>and was prevented even from wishing it removed,

<P>by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.
