<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more
elegance

<P>than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage

<P>early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.

<P>He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;

<P>with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own

<P>gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during

<P>the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,

<P>mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family

<P>to whom accident had now introduced him.&nbsp; Of their

<P>personal charms he had not required a second interview

<P>to be convinced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,

<P>regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.

<P>Marianne was still handsomer.&nbsp; Her form, though not so

<P>correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height,

<P>was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when

<P>in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,

<P>truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.

<P>Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,

<P>her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features

<P>were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;

<P>and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,

<P>a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen

<P>without delight.&nbsp; From Willoughby their expression was at

<P>first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance

<P>of his assistance created.&nbsp; But when this passed away,

<P>when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the

<P>perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness

<P>and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,

<P>that of music and dancing he was passionately fond,

<P>she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the

<P>largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest

<P>of his stay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only necessary to mention any favourite

<P>amusement to engage her to talk.&nbsp; She could not be

<P>silent when such points were introduced, and she

<P>had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.

<P>They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing

<P>and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general

<P>conformity of judgment in all that related to either.

<P>Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,

<P>she proceeded to question him on the subject of books;

<P>her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt

<P>upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of

<P>five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to

<P>become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,

<P>however disregarded before.&nbsp; Their taste was strikingly alike.

<P>The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--

<P>or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,

<P>it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments

<P>and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.

<P>He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;

<P>and long before his visit concluded, they conversed

<P>with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he
had left them,

<P>"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.

<P>You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in

<P>almost every matter of importance.&nbsp; You know what he thinks

<P>of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating

<P>their beauties as he ought, and you have received every

<P>assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.

<P>But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such

<P>extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?

<P>You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.

<P>Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments

<P>on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then

<P>you can have nothing farther to ask."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? is
this

<P>just? are my ideas so scanty?&nbsp; But I see what you mean.

<P>I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.

<P>I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;

<P>I have been open and sincere where I ought to have

<P>been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had

<P>I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I

<P>spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have

<P>been spared."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love," said her mother, "you must not be
offended

<P>with Elinor--she was only in jest.&nbsp; I should scold

<P>her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check

<P>the delight of your conversation with our new friend."--

<P>Marianne was softened in a moment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of
his

<P>pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish

<P>of improving it could offer.&nbsp; He came to them every day.

<P>To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the

<P>encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave

<P>greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it

<P>had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.

<P>She was confined for some days to the house; but never had

<P>any confinement been less irksome.&nbsp; Willoughby was a young

<P>man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,

<P>and open, affectionate manners.&nbsp; He was exactly formed

<P>to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined

<P>not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour

<P>of mind which was now roused and increased by the example

<P>of her own, and which recommended him to her affection

<P>beyond every thing else.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His society became gradually her most exquisite
enjoyment.

<P>They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical

<P>talents were considerable; and he read with all the

<P>sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless

<P>as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him

<P>but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly

<P>delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on

<P>every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.

<P>In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,

<P>in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment

<P>of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,

<P>and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,

<P>he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,

<P>in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation

<P>which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever

<P>seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,

<P>had been rash and unjustifiable.&nbsp; Willoughby was all

<P>that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour

<P>and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;

<P>and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect

<P>as earnest, as his abilities were strong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative

<P>thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect

<P>of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and

<P>expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having

<P>gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne,
which had

<P>so early been discovered by his friends, now first became

<P>perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed

<P>by them.&nbsp; Their attention and wit were drawn off to his

<P>more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other

<P>had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed

<P>when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule

<P>so justly annexed to sensibility.&nbsp; Elinor was obliged,

<P>though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which

<P>Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,

<P>were now actually excited by her sister; and that however

<P>a general resemblance of disposition between the parties

<P>might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally

<P>striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the

<P>regard of Colonel Brandon.&nbsp; She saw it with concern;

<P>for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,

<P>when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as

<P>she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished

<P>him indifferent.&nbsp; She liked him--in spite of his gravity

<P>and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.

<P>His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve

<P>appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits

<P>than of any natural gloominess of temper.&nbsp; Sir John

<P>had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,

<P>which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,

<P>and she regarded him with respect and compassion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more

<P>because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,

<P>who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively

<P>nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby

<P>one day, when they were talking of him together,

<P>"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;

<P>whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers

<P>to talk to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is exactly what I think of him," cried
Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not boast of it, however," said Elinor,
"for it

<P>is injustice in both of you.&nbsp; He is highly esteemed

<P>by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself

<P>without taking pains to converse with him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That he is patronised by YOU," replied Willoughby,

<P>"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem

<P>of the others, it is a reproach in itself.&nbsp; Who would

<P>submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman

<P>as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command

<P>the indifference of any body else?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself

<P>and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady

<P>Middleton and her mother.&nbsp; If their praise is censure,

<P>your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,

<P>than you are prejudiced and unjust."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In defence of your protege you can even be
saucy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My protege, as you call him, is a sensible
man;

<P>and sense will always have attractions for me.

<P>Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.

<P>He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,

<P>has read, and has a thinking mind.&nbsp; I have found him

<P>capable of giving me much information on various subjects;

<P>and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of

<P>good-breeding and good nature."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously,

<P>"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,

<P>and the mosquitoes are troublesome."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had
I made

<P>any such inquiries, but they happened to be points

<P>on which I had been previously informed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Willoughby, "his observations
may

<P>have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,

<P>and palanquins."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may venture to say that HIS observations

<P>have stretched much further than your candour.

<P>But why should you dislike him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not dislike him.&nbsp; I consider him,
on the contrary,

<P>as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word,

<P>and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend,

<P>more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats

<P>every year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has

<P>neither genius, taste, nor spirit.&nbsp; That his understanding

<P>has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice

<P>no expression."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You decide on his imperfections so much in
the mass,"

<P>replied Elinor, "and so much on the strength of your

<P>own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give

<P>of him is comparatively cold and insipid.&nbsp; I can only

<P>pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,

<P>of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are
now using

<P>me unkindly.&nbsp; You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,

<P>and to convince me against my will.&nbsp; But it will not do.

<P>You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.&nbsp; I have

<P>three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;

<P>he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;

<P>he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,

<P>and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.&nbsp; If it

<P>will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,

<P>that I believe his character to be in other respects

<P>irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.&nbsp; And in return

<P>for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,

<P>you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much

<P>as ever."
