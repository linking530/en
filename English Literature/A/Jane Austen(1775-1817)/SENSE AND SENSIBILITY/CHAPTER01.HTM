<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family of Dashwood had long been settled
in Sussex.

<P>Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,

<P>in the centre of their property, where, for many generations,

<P>they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage

<P>the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.

<P>The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived

<P>to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,

<P>had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.

<P>But her death, which happened ten years before his own,

<P>produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply

<P>her loss, he invited and received into his house the family

<P>of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor

<P>of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended

<P>to bequeath it.&nbsp; In the society of his nephew and niece,

<P>and their children, the old Gentleman's days were

<P>comfortably spent.&nbsp; His attachment to them all increased.

<P>The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood

<P>to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,

<P>but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid

<P>comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness

<P>of the children added a relish to his existence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had
one

<P>son: by his present lady, three daughters.&nbsp; The son,

<P>a steady respectable young man, was amply provided

<P>for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,

<P>and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.

<P>By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,

<P>he added to his wealth.&nbsp; To him therefore the succession

<P>to the Norland estate was not so really important as to

<P>his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might

<P>arise to them from their father's inheriting that property,

<P>could be but small.&nbsp; Their mother had nothing, and their

<P>father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;

<P>for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was

<P>also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest

<P>in it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old gentleman died: his will was read,
and

<P>like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment

<P>as pleasure.&nbsp; He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,

<P>as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him

<P>on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.

<P>Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his

<P>wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to

<P>his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old,

<P>it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself

<P>no power of providing for those who were most dear

<P>to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge

<P>on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.

<P>The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,

<P>in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,

<P>had so far gained on the affections of his uncle,

<P>by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children

<P>of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,

<P>an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,

<P>and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value

<P>of all the attention which, for years, he had received

<P>from his niece and her daughters.&nbsp; He meant not to

<P>be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection

<P>for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first,
severe;

<P>but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might

<P>reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,

<P>lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate

<P>already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.

<P>But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his

<P>only one twelvemonth.&nbsp; He survived his uncle no longer;

<P>and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,

<P>was all that remained for his widow and daughters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His son was sent for as soon as his danger
was known,

<P>and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength

<P>and urgency which illness could command, the interest

<P>of his mother-in-law and sisters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings
of the

<P>rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation

<P>of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do

<P>every thing in his power to make them comfortable.

<P>His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,

<P>and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how

<P>much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless
to

<P>be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be

<P>ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;

<P>for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge

<P>of his ordinary duties.&nbsp; Had he married a more amiable woman,

<P>he might have been made still more respectable than he

<P>was:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he

<P>was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.

<P>But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--

<P>more narrow-minded and selfish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he gave his promise to his father, he
meditated

<P>within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters

<P>by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.&nbsp; He then

<P>really thought himself equal to it.&nbsp; The prospect of four

<P>thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,

<P>besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune,

<P>warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--

<P>"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would

<P>be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make

<P>them completely easy.&nbsp; Three thousand pounds! he could

<P>spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."--

<P>He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,

<P>and he did not repent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner was his father's funeral over, than
Mrs. John

<P>Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her

<P>mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.

<P>No one could dispute her right to come; the house was

<P>her husband's from the moment of his father's decease;

<P>but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,

<P>and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only

<P>common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--

<P>but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,

<P>a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,

<P>by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source

<P>of immoveable disgust.&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood had never

<P>been a favourite with any of her husband's family;

<P>but she had had no opportunity, till the present,

<P>of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort

<P>of other people she could act when occasion required it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious

<P>behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her

<P>daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,

<P>she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the

<P>entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect

<P>on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all

<P>her three children determined her afterwards to stay,

<P>and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice
was

<P>so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,

<P>and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,

<P>though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,

<P>and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage

<P>of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood

<P>which must generally have led to imprudence.&nbsp; She had

<P>an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,

<P>and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern

<P>them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;

<P>and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,

<P>quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;

<P>but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have

<P>no moderation.&nbsp; She was generous, amiable, interesting: she

<P>was everything but prudent.&nbsp; The resemblance between

<P>her and her mother was strikingly great.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her

<P>sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued

<P>and cherished.&nbsp; They encouraged each other now in the

<P>violence of their affliction.&nbsp; The agony of grief

<P>which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,

<P>was sought for, was created again and again.&nbsp; They gave

<P>themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase

<P>of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,

<P>and resolved against ever admitting consolation

<P>in future.&nbsp; Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still

<P>she could struggle, she could exert herself.&nbsp; She could

<P>consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law

<P>on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;

<P>and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,

<P>and encourage her to similar forbearance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,

<P>well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed

<P>a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having

<P>much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair

<P>to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.
