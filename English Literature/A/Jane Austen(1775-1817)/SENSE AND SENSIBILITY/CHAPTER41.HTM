<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel
Brandon,

<P>proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the

<P>excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildings,

<P>that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called

<P>on her again the next day with her congratulations,

<P>that she had never seen him in such spirits before in

<P>her life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were
at

<P>least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most

<P>heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably

<P>together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.

<P>So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness

<P>to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her,

<P>that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most

<P>grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation

<P>to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their

<P>good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future,

<P>would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of

<P>doing any thing in the world for those she really valued.

<P>As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship

<P>him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that

<P>he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;

<P>anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost;

<P>and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford,

<P>as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage,

<P>his cows, and his poultry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was now above a week since John Dashwood
had

<P>called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no notice

<P>had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition,

<P>beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it

<P>necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation,

<P>however, which not only opposed her own inclination,

<P>but which had not the assistance of any encouragement

<P>from her companions.&nbsp; Marianne, not contented with

<P>absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent

<P>to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,

<P>though her carriage was always at Elinor's service,

<P>so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her

<P>curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,

<P>nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part,

<P>could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.

<P>The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself

<P>to pay a visit, for which no one could really have

<P>less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete

<P>with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much

<P>reason to dislike.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage
could

<P>turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.

<P>He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her

<P>that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street, and,

<P>assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,

<P>invited her to come in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody

<P>was there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fanny is in her own room, I suppose," said
he:--"I

<P>will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not

<P>have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.--

<P>Very far from it, indeed.&nbsp; NOW especially there

<P>cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always

<P>great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor made what excuse she could for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sorry to see you alone," he replied,

<P>"for I have a good deal to say to you.&nbsp; This living

<P>of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has he really given

<P>it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was

<P>coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has
given

<P>the living of Delaford to Edward."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no

<P>relationship!--no connection between them!--and now

<P>that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About two hundred a year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well--and for the next presentation to
a living

<P>of that value--supposing the late incumbent to have

<P>been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he

<P>might have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.

<P>And how came he not to have settled that matter before this

<P>person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it,

<P>but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should

<P>be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,

<P>concern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal

<P>of inconsistency in almost every human character.&nbsp; I suppose,

<P>however--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS.

<P>Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom

<P>the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough

<P>to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively;

<P>and by relating that she had herself been employed

<P>in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward,

<P>and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it

<P>was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is truly astonishing!"--he cried, after
hearing

<P>what she said--"what could be the Colonel's motive?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,

<P>Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter

<P>to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her,

<P>and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear

<P>it much talked of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain
from observing,

<P>that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure,

<P>an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither

<P>she nor her child could be possibly impoverished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Ferrars," added he, lowering his voice
to the

<P>tone becoming so important a subject, "knows nothing

<P>about it at present, and I believe it will be best to

<P>keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--

<P>When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear

<P>of it all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why should such precaution be used?--Though

<P>it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have

<P>the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has

<P>money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite

<P>out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,

<P>is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her

<P>son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those

<P>over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.

<P>Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable

<P>to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--

<P>she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--

<P>She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort

<P>of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Elinor," said John, "your reasoning is
very good,

<P>but it is founded on ignorance of human nature.

<P>When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it

<P>his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;

<P>and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that

<P>dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.

<P>Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You surprise me; I should think it must nearly

<P>have escaped her memory by THIS time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wrong her exceedingly.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars
is one

<P>of the most affectionate mothers in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was silent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We think NOW,"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a
short pause,

<P>"of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance

<P>of her brother's tone, calmly replied,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the
affair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Choice!--how do you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only mean that I suppose, from your manner

<P>of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether

<P>she marry Edward or Robert."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly, there can be no difference; for
Robert

<P>will now to all intents and purposes be considered

<P>as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are

<P>both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one

<P>is superior to the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor said no more, and John was also for
a short

<P>time silent.--His reflections ended thus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of ONE thing, my dear sister," kindly taking
her hand,

<P>and speaking in an awful whisper,--"I may assure you;--

<P>and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you.

<P>I have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the

<P>best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise

<P>it would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but

<P>I have it from the very best authority--not that I ever

<P>precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her

<P>daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short,

<P>whatever objections there might be against a certain--a

<P>certain connection--you understand me--it would have been

<P>far preferable to her, it would not have given her half

<P>the vexation that THIS does.&nbsp; I was exceedingly pleased

<P>to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--

<P>a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.

<P>'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least

<P>evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW

<P>for nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out

<P>of the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--

<P>as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all

<P>that is gone by.&nbsp; But I thought I would just tell you

<P>of this, because I knew how much it must please you.

<P>Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor.&nbsp; There

<P>is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well,

<P>or better, perhaps, all things considered.&nbsp; Has Colonel

<P>Brandon been with you lately?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify
her vanity,

<P>and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves

<P>and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be

<P>spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,

<P>and from the danger of hearing any thing more from

<P>her brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.

<P>After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that

<P>Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there,

<P>quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left

<P>to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the

<P>gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner

<P>while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love

<P>and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,

<P>earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that

<P>brother's integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable

<P>opinion of his head and heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,

<P>before he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard

<P>of the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject.

<P>Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them

<P>to John; and their effect on Robert, though very different,

<P>was not less striking than it had been on HIM.&nbsp; He laughed

<P>most immoderately.&nbsp; The idea of Edward's being a clergyman,

<P>and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him

<P>beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful

<P>imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice,

<P>and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and

<P>Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable

<P>gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain

<P>her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke

<P>all the contempt it excited.&nbsp; It was a look, however,

<P>very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave

<P>no intelligence to him.&nbsp; He was recalled from wit to wisdom,

<P>not by any reproof of her's, but by his own sensibility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may treat it as a joke," said he, at last,

<P>recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably

<P>lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--"but, upon

<P>my soul, it is a most serious business.&nbsp; Poor Edward!

<P>he is ruined for ever.&nbsp; I am extremely sorry for it--

<P>for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as

<P>well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.

<P>You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR

<P>slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly

<P>not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born,

<P>you know, with the same powers,--the same address.--

<P>Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--

<P>to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,

<P>I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;

<P>and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my

<P>life, as when it all burst forth.&nbsp; I could not believe it.--

<P>My mother was the first person who told me of it;

<P>and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,

<P>immediately said to her, 'My dear madam, I do not know

<P>what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself,

<P>I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman,

<P>I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.--

<P>I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has

<P>done for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from

<P>all decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother,

<P>I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style

<P>of education, it was always to be expected.&nbsp; My poor mother

<P>was half frantic."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever seen the lady?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; once, while she was staying in this house,

<P>I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw

<P>quite enough of her.&nbsp; The merest awkward country girl,

<P>without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--

<P>I remember her perfectly.&nbsp; Just the kind of girl I

<P>should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward.

<P>I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related

<P>the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade

<P>him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found,

<P>to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way

<P>at first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach

<P>had taken place, when it was not for me, you know,

<P>to interfere.&nbsp; But had I been informed of it a few

<P>hours earlier--I think it is most probable--that something

<P>might have been hit on.&nbsp; I certainly should have represented

<P>it to Edward in a very strong light.&nbsp; 'My dear fellow,'

<P>I should have said, 'consider what you are doing.

<P>You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one

<P>as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot

<P>help thinking, in short, that means might have been found.

<P>But now it is all too late.&nbsp; He must be starved, you know;--

<P>that is certain; absolutely starved."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had just settled this point with great composure,

<P>when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.

<P>But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family,

<P>Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something

<P>like confusion of countenance with which she entered,

<P>and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.

<P>She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find

<P>that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town,

<P>as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion

<P>in which her husband, who attended her into the room,

<P>and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish

<P>every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.
