<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However small Elinor's general dependence on

<P>Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her

<P>on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,

<P>where no temptation could be answerable to the folly

<P>of inventing a falsehood of such a description.&nbsp; What Lucy

<P>had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,

<P>dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every

<P>side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted

<P>by nothing but her own wishes.&nbsp; Their opportunity of

<P>acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation

<P>for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's

<P>visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,

<P>his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain

<P>behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the

<P>Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections,

<P>which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,

<P>the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,

<P>as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,

<P>and established as a fact, which no partiality could

<P>set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment

<P>of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,

<P>for a short time made her feel only for herself;

<P>but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.

<P>Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?&nbsp; Had he feigned

<P>a regard for her which he did not feel?&nbsp; Was his engagement

<P>to Lucy an engagement of the heart?&nbsp; No; whatever it might

<P>once have been, she could not believe it such at present.

<P>His affection was all her own.&nbsp; She could not be deceived

<P>in that.&nbsp; Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been

<P>conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not

<P>an illusion of her own vanity.&nbsp; He certainly loved her.

<P>What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!&nbsp; How much

<P>could it not tempt her to forgive!&nbsp; He had been blamable,

<P>highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first

<P>felt her influence over him to be more than it ought

<P>to be.&nbsp; In that, he could not be defended; but if he

<P>had injured her, how much more had he injured himself;

<P>if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.

<P>His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it

<P>seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever

<P>being otherwise.&nbsp; She might in time regain tranquillity;

<P>but HE, what had he to look forward to?&nbsp; Could he

<P>ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he,

<P>were his affection for herself out of the question,

<P>with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,

<P>be satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,

<P>and selfish?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youthful infatuation of nineteen would
naturally

<P>blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;

<P>but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally

<P>spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must

<P>have opened his eyes to her defects of education,

<P>while the same period of time, spent on her side

<P>in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,

<P>had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might

<P>once have given an interesting character to her beauty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If in the supposition of his seeking to marry
herself,

<P>his difficulties from his mother had seemed great,

<P>how much greater were they now likely to be, when

<P>the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior

<P>in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.

<P>These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated

<P>from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;

<P>but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the

<P>expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could

<P>be felt as a relief!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As these considerations occurred to her in
painful

<P>succession, she wept for him, more than for herself.

<P>Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to

<P>merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief

<P>that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,

<P>she thought she could even now, under the first smart

<P>of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every

<P>suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.

<P>And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,

<P>that when she joined them at dinner only two hours

<P>after she had first suffered the extinction of all her

<P>dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the

<P>appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning

<P>in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever

<P>from the object of her love, and that Marianne was

<P>internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose

<P>whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she

<P>expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessity of concealing from her mother
and

<P>Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,

<P>though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no

<P>aggravation of Elinor's distress.&nbsp; On the contrary

<P>it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication

<P>of what would give such affliction to them, and to be

<P>saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward,

<P>which would probably flow from the excess of their partial

<P>affection for herself, and which was more than she felt

<P>equal to support.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From their counsel, or their conversation,
she knew

<P>she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and

<P>sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command

<P>would neither receive encouragement from their example

<P>nor from their praise.&nbsp; She was stronger alone,

<P>and her own good sense so well supported her, that her

<P>firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness

<P>as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,

<P>it was possible for them to be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much as she had suffered from her first conversation

<P>with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish

<P>of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.

<P>She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement

<P>repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand

<P>what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any

<P>sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,

<P>and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her

<P>readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness

<P>in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested

<P>in it than as a friend, which she very much feared

<P>her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,

<P>must have left at least doubtful.&nbsp; That Lucy was disposed

<P>to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain

<P>that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,

<P>not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing

<P>to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,

<P>with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.

<P>And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had

<P>some weight.&nbsp; But indeed, while Elinor remained so well

<P>assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,

<P>it required no other consideration of probabilities

<P>to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;

<P>and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.

<P>What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could

<P>there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's

<P>superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him

<P>in future?&nbsp; She had little difficulty in understanding thus

<P>much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly

<P>resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and

<P>honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward

<P>and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny

<P>herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy

<P>that her heart was unwounded.&nbsp; And as she could now have

<P>nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already

<P>been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going

<P>through a repetition of particulars with composure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was not immediately that an opportunity

<P>of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well

<P>disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;

<P>for the weather was not often fine enough to allow

<P>of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily

<P>separate themselves from the others; and though they

<P>met at least every other evening either at the park

<P>or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could

<P>not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.

<P>Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady

<P>Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure

<P>was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for

<P>particular discourse.&nbsp; They met for the sake of eating,

<P>drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,

<P>or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two meetings of this kind had taken
place,

<P>without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy

<P>in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,

<P>to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all

<P>dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged

<P>to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be

<P>quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.

<P>Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she

<P>had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,

<P>more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil

<P>and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when

<P>her husband united them together in one noisy purpose,

<P>immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her

<P>mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,

<P>though always unwilling to join any of their parties,

<P>was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her

<P>seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was
happily

<P>preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.

<P>The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor

<P>had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought

<P>or expression, and nothing could be less interesting

<P>than the whole of their discourse both in the dining

<P>parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children

<P>accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was

<P>too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's

<P>attention to attempt it.&nbsp; They quitted it only with the

<P>removal of the tea-things.&nbsp; The card-table was then placed,

<P>and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever

<P>entertained a hope of finding time for conversation

<P>at the park.&nbsp; They all rose up in preparation for a round game.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am glad," said Lady Middleton to Lucy,

<P>"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's

<P>basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your

<P>eyes to work filigree by candlelight.&nbsp; And we will make

<P>the dear little love some amends for her disappointment

<P>to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself
instantly

<P>and replied, "Indeed you are very much mistaken,

<P>Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can

<P>make your party without me, or I should have been at my

<P>filigree already.&nbsp; I would not disappoint the little angel

<P>for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,

<P>I am resolved to finish the basket after supper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your
eyes--

<P>will you ring the bell for some working candles?

<P>My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know,

<P>if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I

<P>told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends

<P>upon having it done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy directly drew her work table near her

<P>and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness

<P>which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater

<P>delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino
to the others.

<P>No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual

<P>inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,

<P>"Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you

<P>know I detest cards.&nbsp; I shall go to the piano-forte;

<P>I have not touched it since it was tuned."&nbsp; And without

<P>farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven

<P>that SHE had never made so rude a speech.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne can never keep long from that instrument

<P>you know, ma'am," said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth

<P>away the offence; "and I do not much wonder at it; for it

<P>is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining five were now to draw their cards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," continued Elinor, "if I should happen

<P>to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,

<P>in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still

<P>to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible

<P>I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.

<P>I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow

<P>me a share in it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you

<P>for your help," cried Lucy, "for I find there is more

<P>to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would

<P>be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! that would be terrible, indeed," said
Miss Steele--

<P>"Dear little soul, how I do love her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to
Elinor;

<P>"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be

<P>as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,

<P>or will you take your chance now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these
proposals,

<P>and thus by a little of that address which Marianne

<P>could never condescend to practise, gained her own end,

<P>and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.&nbsp; Lucy made room

<P>for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were

<P>thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the

<P>utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.

<P>The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own

<P>music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten

<P>that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily

<P>so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,

<P>under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting

<P>subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.
