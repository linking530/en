<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Elinor and Marianne were walking together
the

<P>next morning the latter communicated a piece of news

<P>to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew

<P>before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,

<P>surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.

<P>Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that

<P>Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred

<P>himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was

<P>exactly calculated to carry a woman.&nbsp; Without considering

<P>that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse,

<P>that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of

<P>this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and

<P>keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable

<P>to receive them, she had accepted the present without

<P>hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire

<P>immediately for it," she added, "and when it arrives we

<P>will ride every day.&nbsp; You shall share its use with me.

<P>Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop

<P>on some of these downs."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most unwilling was she to awaken from such
a dream of

<P>felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended

<P>the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.

<P>As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;

<P>Mamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse

<P>would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;

<P>as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.

<P>Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving

<P>such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately

<P>known to her.&nbsp; This was too much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly,

<P>"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.

<P>I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better

<P>acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature

<P>in the world, except yourself and mama.&nbsp; It is not

<P>time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--

<P>it is disposition alone.&nbsp; Seven years would be insufficient

<P>to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven

<P>days are more than enough for others.&nbsp; I should hold

<P>myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse

<P>from my brother, than from Willoughby.&nbsp; Of John I know

<P>very little, though we have lived together for years;

<P>but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point
no more.

<P>She knew her sister's temper.&nbsp; Opposition on so tender a

<P>subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.

<P>But by an appeal to her affection for her mother,

<P>by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent

<P>mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be

<P>the case) she consented to this increase of establishment,

<P>Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to

<P>tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning

<P>the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,

<P>that it must be declined.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby

<P>called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her

<P>express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on

<P>being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.

<P>The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,

<P>and they were such as to make further entreaty on his

<P>side impossible.&nbsp; His concern however was very apparent;

<P>and after expressing it with earnestness, he added,

<P>in the same low voice,--"But, Marianne, the horse is

<P>still yours, though you cannot use it now.&nbsp; I shall keep

<P>it only till you can claim it.&nbsp; When you leave Barton

<P>to form your own establishment in a more lasting home,

<P>Queen Mab shall receive you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and
in the

<P>whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,

<P>and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone,

<P>she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning

<P>so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.

<P>>From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged

<P>to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise

<P>than that she, or any of their friends, should be left

<P>by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret related something to her the next
day,

<P>which placed this matter in a still clearer light.

<P>Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them,

<P>and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour

<P>with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity

<P>for observations, which, with a most important face,

<P>she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were

<P>next by themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret
to

<P>tell you about Marianne.&nbsp; I am sure she will be married

<P>to Mr. Willoughby very soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have said so," replied Elinor, "almost
every

<P>day since they first met on High-church Down; and they

<P>had not known each other a week, I believe, before you

<P>were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;

<P>but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But indeed this is quite another thing.&nbsp;
I am sure

<P>they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock

<P>of her hair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take care, Margaret.&nbsp; It may be only
the hair

<P>of some great uncle of HIS."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am
almost

<P>sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.&nbsp; Last night

<P>after tea, when you and mama went out of the room,

<P>they were whispering and talking together as fast as

<P>could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,

<P>and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long

<P>lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;

<P>and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;

<P>and put it into his pocket-book."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such particulars, stated on such authority,

<P>Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed

<P>to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with

<P>what she had heard and seen herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed
in a

<P>way so satisfactory to her sister.&nbsp; When Mrs. Jennings

<P>attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name

<P>of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite,

<P>which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,

<P>Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,

<P>"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor

<P>tried to laugh too.&nbsp; But the effort was painful.

<P>She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person

<P>whose name she could not bear with composure to become

<P>a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she
did

<P>more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red

<P>and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember that whatever your conjectures may
be,

<P>you have no right to repeat them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never had any conjectures about it," replied
Margaret;

<P>"it was you who told me of it yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This increased the mirth of the company, and
Margaret

<P>was eagerly pressed to say something more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about
it,"

<P>said Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp; "What is the gentleman's name?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well
what it is;

<P>and I know where he is too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his
own house

<P>at Norland to be sure.&nbsp; He is the curate of the parish

<P>I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, THAT he is not.&nbsp; He is of no profession
at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth,

<P>"you know that all this is an invention of your own,

<P>and that there is no such person in existence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for
I

<P>am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins

<P>with an F."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton

<P>for observing, at this moment, "that it rained very hard,"

<P>though she believed the interruption to proceed less from

<P>any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike

<P>of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted

<P>her husband and mother.&nbsp; The idea however started by her,

<P>was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was

<P>on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;

<P>and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.

<P>Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne

<P>to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours

<P>of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.

<P>But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into

<P>which it had thrown her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A party was formed this evening for going on
the

<P>following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles

<P>from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon,

<P>without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor,

<P>who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.

<P>The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,

<P>and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,

<P>might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had

<P>formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer

<P>for the last ten years.&nbsp; They contained a noble piece

<P>of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of

<P>the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,

<P>open carriages only to be employed, and every thing

<P>conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To some few of the company it appeared rather

<P>a bold undertaking, considering the time of year,

<P>and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--

<P>and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded

<P>by Elinor to stay at home.
