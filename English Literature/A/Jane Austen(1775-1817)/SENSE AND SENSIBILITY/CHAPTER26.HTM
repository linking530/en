<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not find herself in the carriage
with Mrs. Jennings,

<P>and beginning a journey to London under her protection,

<P>and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,

<P>so short had their acquaintance with that lady been,

<P>so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,

<P>and so many had been her objections against such a measure

<P>only a few days before! But these objections had all,

<P>with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother

<P>equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,

<P>in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy,

<P>could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation

<P>which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes

<P>of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,

<P>how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,

<P>and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of

<P>Marianne's situation to have the same animating object

<P>in view, the same possibility of hope.&nbsp; A short, a very

<P>short time however must now decide what Willoughby's

<P>intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.

<P>Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence

<P>on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon

<P>gaining every new light as to his character which her

<P>own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,

<P>but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister

<P>with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was

<P>and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.

<P>Should the result of her observations be unfavourable,

<P>she was determined at all events to open the eyes

<P>of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions

<P>would be of a different nature--she must then learn

<P>to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret

<P>which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were three days on their journey, and
Marianne's

<P>behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what

<P>future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings

<P>might be expected to be.&nbsp; She sat in silence almost all

<P>the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever

<P>voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque

<P>beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation

<P>of delight exclusively addressed to her sister.&nbsp; To atone

<P>for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession

<P>of the post of civility which she had assigned herself,

<P>behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,

<P>talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her

<P>whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side

<P>treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous

<P>on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only

<P>disturbed that she could not make them choose their own

<P>dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their

<P>preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.

<P>They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to

<P>be released, after such a journey, from the confinement

<P>of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted
up,

<P>and the young ladies were immediately put in possession

<P>of a very comfortable apartment.&nbsp; It had formerly

<P>been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung

<P>a landscape in coloured silks of her performance,

<P>in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school

<P>in town to some effect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As dinner was not to be ready in less than
two

<P>hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ

<P>the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for

<P>that purpose.&nbsp; In a few moments Marianne did the same.

<P>"I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor; "had not you

<P>better defer your letter for a day or two?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am NOT going to write to my mother,"

<P>replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid

<P>any farther inquiry.&nbsp; Elinor said no more; it immediately

<P>struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;

<P>and the conclusion which as instantly followed was,

<P>that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct

<P>the affair, they must be engaged.&nbsp; This conviction,

<P>though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,

<P>and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.

<P>Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes;

<P>in length it could be no more than a note; it was then

<P>folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.

<P>Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in

<P>the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,

<P>ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it

<P>to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.

<P>This decided the matter at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her spirits still continued very high; but
there

<P>was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much

<P>pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as

<P>the evening drew on.&nbsp; She could scarcely eat any dinner,

<P>and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,

<P>seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that
Mrs. Jennings,

<P>by being much engaged in her own room, could see little

<P>of what was passing.&nbsp; The tea things were brought in,

<P>and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once

<P>by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly

<P>heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,

<P>Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,

<P>and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.

<P>Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;

<P>she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,

<P>and after listening half a minute, returned into the room

<P>in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard

<P>him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her

<P>feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,

<P>"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!" and seemed

<P>almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel

<P>Brandon appeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,

<P>and she immediately left the room.&nbsp; Elinor was disappointed too;

<P>but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured

<P>his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that

<P>a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she

<P>experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.

<P>She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,

<P>that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,

<P>with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him

<P>the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your sister ill?" said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor answered in some distress that she was,

<P>and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;

<P>and of every thing to which she could decently attribute

<P>her sister's behaviour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard her with the most earnest attention,

<P>but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,

<P>and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them

<P>in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,

<P>and the friends they had left behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this calm kind of way, with very little
interest

<P>on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out

<P>of spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.

<P>Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were

<P>then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain

<P>by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way

<P>of saying something, she asked if he had been in London

<P>ever since she had seen him last.&nbsp; "Yes," he replied,

<P>with some embarrassment, "almost ever since; I have been

<P>once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never

<P>been in my power to return to Barton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, and the manner in which it was said,

<P>immediately brought back to her remembrance all the

<P>circumstances of his quitting that place, with the

<P>uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,

<P>and she was fearful that her question had implied

<P>much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings soon came in.&nbsp; "Oh! Colonel,"
said she,

<P>with her usual noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad

<P>to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your

<P>pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little,

<P>and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I

<P>have been at home, and you know one has always a world

<P>of little odd things to do after one has been away for

<P>any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--

<P>Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!

<P>But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should

<P>be in town today?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's,

<P>where I have been dining."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do
at their

<P>house?&nbsp; How does Charlotte do?&nbsp; I warrant you she is a fine

<P>size by this time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am
commissioned

<P>to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.&nbsp; Well,
Colonel,

<P>I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,

<P>you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.

<P>Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be

<P>sorry to hear.&nbsp; I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby

<P>will do between you about her.&nbsp; Ay, it is a fine thing

<P>to be young and handsome.&nbsp; Well! I was young once, but I

<P>never was very handsome--worse luck for me.&nbsp; However, I got

<P>a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest

<P>beauty can do more.&nbsp; Ah! poor man! he has been dead

<P>these eight years and better.&nbsp; But Colonel, where have

<P>you been to since we parted?&nbsp; And how does your business

<P>go on?&nbsp; Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He replied with his accustomary mildness to
all

<P>her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.

<P>Elinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was

<P>obliged to appear again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became

<P>more thoughtful and silent than he had been before,

<P>and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.

<P>No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies

<P>were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne rose the next morning with recovered
spirits

<P>and happy looks.&nbsp; The disappointment of the evening before

<P>seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen

<P>that day.&nbsp; They had not long finished their breakfast before

<P>Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few

<P>minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted

<P>to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she

<P>received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss

<P>Dashwoods again.&nbsp; So surprised at their coming to town,

<P>though it was what she had rather expected all along;

<P>so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation

<P>after having declined her own, though at the same time

<P>she would never have forgiven them if they had not come!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,"

<P>said she; "What do you think he said when he heard

<P>of your coming with Mamma?&nbsp; I forget what it was now,

<P>but it was something so droll!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an hour or two spent in what her mother
called

<P>comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry

<P>concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side,

<P>and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was

<P>proposed by the latter that they should all accompany

<P>her to some shops where she had business that morning,

<P>to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,

<P>as having likewise some purchases to make themselves;

<P>and Marianne, though declining it at first was induced

<P>to go likewise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever they went, she was evidently always
on

<P>the watch.&nbsp; In Bond Street especially, where much of

<P>their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;

<P>and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was

<P>equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,

<P>from all that interested and occupied the others.

<P>Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could

<P>never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,

<P>however it might equally concern them both: she received

<P>no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at

<P>home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation

<P>at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught

<P>by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild

<P>to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her

<P>time in rapture and indecision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was late in the morning before they returned
home;

<P>and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew

<P>eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found

<P>her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,

<P>which declared that no Willoughby had been there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Has no letter been left here for me since
we went out?"

<P>said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.

<P>She was answered in the negative.&nbsp; "Are you quite sure

<P>of it?" she replied.&nbsp; "Are you certain that no servant,

<P>no porter has left any letter or note?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man replied that none had.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed

<P>voice, as she turned away to the window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself,

<P>regarding her sister with uneasiness.&nbsp; "If she had not

<P>known him to be in town she would not have written to him,

<P>as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;

<P>and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither

<P>come nor write!&nbsp; Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong

<P>in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,

<P>a man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,

<P>so mysterious a manner!&nbsp; I long to inquire; and how will MY

<P>interference be borne."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She determined, after some consideration, that
if

<P>appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they

<P>now were, she would represent in the strongest manner

<P>to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs.
Jennings's

<P>intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited

<P>in the morning, dined with them.&nbsp; The former left them

<P>soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;

<P>and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table

<P>for the others.&nbsp; Marianne was of no use on these occasions,

<P>as she would never learn the game; but though her time

<P>was therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no

<P>means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor,

<P>for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the

<P>pain of disappointment.&nbsp; She sometimes endeavoured for a

<P>few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,

<P>and she returned to the more interesting employment

<P>of walking backwards and forwards across the room,

<P>pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,

<P>in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.
