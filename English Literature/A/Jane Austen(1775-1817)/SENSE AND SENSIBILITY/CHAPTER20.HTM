<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room
of the park

<P>the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at

<P>the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.

<P>She took them all most affectionately by the hand,

<P>and expressed great delight in seeing them again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so glad to see you!" said she, seating
herself

<P>between Elinor and Marianne, "for it is so bad a day I was

<P>afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,

<P>as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons

<P>come to us next week you know.&nbsp; It was quite a sudden thing

<P>our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage

<P>was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I

<P>would go with him to Barton.&nbsp; He is so droll! He never

<P>tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;

<P>however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were obliged to put an end to such an
expectation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a
laugh,

<P>"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.&nbsp; I could

<P>get the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,

<P>in Hanover-square.&nbsp; You must come, indeed.&nbsp; I am sure

<P>I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till

<P>I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go

<P>into public."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They thanked her; but were obliged to resist
all

<P>her entreaties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband,

<P>who just then entered the room--"you must help me to

<P>persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her love made no answer; and after slightly
bowing

<P>to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How horrid all this is!" said he.&nbsp; "Such
weather

<P>makes every thing and every body disgusting.&nbsp; Dullness

<P>is as much produced within doors as without, by rain.

<P>It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.&nbsp; What the

<P>devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room

<P>in his house?&nbsp; How few people know what comfort is!&nbsp; Sir

<P>John is as stupid as the weather."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the company soon dropt in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John,
"you have

<P>not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't be so sly before us," said Mrs.
Palmer;

<P>"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your

<P>taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome.

<P>We do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.

<P>Not above ten miles, I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Much nearer thirty," said her husband.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, well! there is not much difference.

<P>I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet

<P>pretty place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,"

<P>said Mr. Palmer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne remained perfectly silent, though
her

<P>countenance betrayed her interest in what was said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it very ugly?" continued Mrs. Palmer--"then
it

<P>must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they were seated in the dining room, Sir
John

<P>observed with regret that they were only eight all together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear," said he to his lady, "it is very
provoking

<P>that we should be so few.&nbsp; Why did not you ask the Gilberts

<P>to come to us today?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke
to me

<P>about it before, that it could not be done?&nbsp; They dined

<P>with us last."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings,

<P>"should not stand upon such ceremony."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you would be very ill-bred," cried Mr.
Palmer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love you contradict every body," said his
wife

<P>with her usual laugh.&nbsp; "Do you know that you are quite rude?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not know I contradicted any body in
calling

<P>your mother ill-bred."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said
the good-natured

<P>old lady, "you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot

<P>give her back again.&nbsp; So there I have the whip hand of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her

<P>husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,

<P>she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must

<P>live together.&nbsp; It was impossible for any one to be more

<P>thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy

<P>than Mrs. Palmer.&nbsp; The studied indifference, insolence,

<P>and discontent of her husband gave her no pain;

<P>and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper,

<P>to Elinor.&nbsp; "He is always out of humour."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation,

<P>to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly

<P>ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.

<P>His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,

<P>like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable

<P>bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly

<P>woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too

<P>common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--

<P>It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,

<P>which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,

<P>and his general abuse of every thing before him.

<P>It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.

<P>The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,

<P>however they might succeed by establishing his superiority

<P>in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him

<P>except his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer
soon afterwards,

<P>"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.

<P>Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this

<P>Christmas?&nbsp; Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are

<P>with us.&nbsp; You cannot think how happy I shall be!&nbsp; It will

<P>be quite delightful!--My love," applying to her husband,

<P>"don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," he replied, with a sneer--"I came

<P>into Devonshire with no other view."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There now,"--said his lady, "you see Mr. Palmer

<P>expects you; so you cannot refuse to come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They both eagerly and resolutely declined her
invitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But indeed you must and shall come.&nbsp;
I am sure you

<P>will like it of all things.&nbsp; The Westons will be with us,

<P>and it will be quite delightful.&nbsp; You cannot think

<P>what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,

<P>for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing

<P>against the election; and so many people came to dine

<P>with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!&nbsp; But,

<P>poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced

<P>to make every body like him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as
she

<P>assented to the hardship of such an obligation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How charming it will be," said Charlotte,
"when he

<P>is in Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!&nbsp; It will

<P>be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him

<P>with an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank

<P>for me?&nbsp; He declares he won't.&nbsp; Don't you, Mr. Palmer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He cannot bear writing, you know," she continued--

<P>"he says it is quite shocking."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said he, "I never said any thing so irrational.

<P>Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There now; you see how droll he is.&nbsp;
This is always

<P>the way with him!&nbsp; Sometimes he won't speak to me for half

<P>a day together, and then he comes out with something

<P>so droll--all about any thing in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She surprised Elinor very much as they returned

<P>into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did

<P>not like Mr. Palmer excessively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," said Elinor; "he seems very agreeable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well--I am so glad you do.&nbsp; I thought
you would,

<P>he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased

<P>with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't

<P>think how disappointed he will be if you don't come

<P>to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object

<P>to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;

<P>and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.

<P>She thought it probable that as they lived in the

<P>same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some

<P>more particular account of Willoughby's general

<P>character, than could be gathered from the Middletons'

<P>partial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain

<P>from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might

<P>remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.&nbsp; She began

<P>by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,

<P>and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,"

<P>replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke

<P>to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.

<P>Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton

<P>while he was at Allenham.&nbsp; Mama saw him here once before;--

<P>but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.&nbsp; However, I dare say

<P>we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,

<P>if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never

<P>have been in the country together.&nbsp; He is very little

<P>at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,

<P>I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is

<P>in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a

<P>way off.&nbsp; I know why you inquire about him, very well;

<P>your sister is to marry him.&nbsp; I am monstrous glad of it,

<P>for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word," replied Elinor, "you know much

<P>more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason

<P>to expect such a match."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't pretend to deny it, because you know
it is

<P>what every body talks of.&nbsp; I assure you I heard of it

<P>in my way through town."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear Mrs. Palmer!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon

<P>Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,

<P>and he told me of it directly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You surprise me very much.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon
tell

<P>you of it!&nbsp; Surely you must be mistaken.&nbsp; To give such

<P>intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,

<P>even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel

<P>Brandon to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I do assure you it was so, for all that,

<P>and I will tell you how it happened.&nbsp; When we met him,

<P>he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking

<P>of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,

<P>and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family

<P>come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word

<P>they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be

<P>married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.&nbsp; Is it true,

<P>pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in

<P>Devonshire so lately.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what did the Colonel say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as
if he

<P>knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down

<P>as certain.&nbsp; It will be quite delightful, I declare!

<P>When is it to take place?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,

<P>he did nothing but say fine things of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am flattered by his commendation.&nbsp;
He seems

<P>an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So do I.--He is such a charming man, that
it

<P>is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.

<P>Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--

<P>I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he

<P>hardly ever falls in love with any body."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part

<P>of Somersetshire?" said Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not
believe

<P>many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna

<P>is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable

<P>I assure you.&nbsp; Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby

<P>wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.

<P>She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;

<P>not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,

<P>because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing

<P>can be good enough for her.&nbsp; However, I don't think

<P>her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;

<P>for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does

<P>Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him

<P>to own it last night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby

<P>was not very material; but any testimony in his favour,

<P>however small, was pleasing to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,"

<P>continued Charlotte.--"And now I hope we shall always be

<P>great friends.&nbsp; You can't think how much I longed to see you!

<P>It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!

<P>Nothing can be like it, to be sure!&nbsp; And I am so glad

<P>your sister is going to be well married!&nbsp; I hope you will

<P>be a great deal at Combe Magna.&nbsp; It is a sweet place,

<P>by all accounts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been long acquainted with Colonel
Brandon,

<P>have not you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--

<P>He was a particular friend of Sir John's. I believe,"

<P>she added in a low voice, "he would have been very

<P>glad to have had me, if he could.&nbsp; Sir John and Lady

<P>Middleton wished it very much.&nbsp; But mama did not think

<P>the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would

<P>have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been

<P>married immediately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's
proposal

<P>to your mother before it was made?&nbsp; Had he never owned

<P>his affection to yourself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,

<P>I dare say he would have liked it of all things.

<P>He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before

<P>I left school.&nbsp; However, I am much happier as I am.

<P>Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like."
