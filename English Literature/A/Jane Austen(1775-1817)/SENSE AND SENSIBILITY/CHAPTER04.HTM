<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne,

<P>"that Edward should have no taste for drawing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why
should

<P>you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has

<P>great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,

<P>and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,

<P>though he has not had opportunities of improving it.

<P>Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would

<P>have drawn very well.&nbsp; He distrusts his own judgment

<P>in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling

<P>to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate

<P>propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general

<P>direct him perfectly right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was afraid of offending, and said
no more

<P>on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor

<P>described as excited in him by the drawings of other

<P>people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,

<P>in her opinion, could alone be called taste.&nbsp; Yet, though

<P>smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured

<P>her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you
do not

<P>consider him as deficient in general taste.&nbsp; Indeed, I think

<P>I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him

<P>is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,

<P>I am sure you could never be civil to him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne hardly knew what to say.&nbsp; She
would

<P>not wound the feelings of her sister on any account,

<P>and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.

<P>At length she replied:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of
him

<P>is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.

<P>I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter

<P>propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,

<P>as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world

<P>of his goodness and sense.&nbsp; I think him every thing that is

<P>worthy and amiable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile,

<P>"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied

<P>with such commendation as that.&nbsp; I do not perceive

<P>how you could express yourself more warmly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so
easily pleased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of his sense and his goodness," continued
Elinor,

<P>"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him

<P>often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.

<P>The excellence of his understanding and his principles

<P>can be concealed only by that shyness which too often

<P>keeps him silent.&nbsp; You know enough of him to do justice

<P>to his solid worth.&nbsp; But of his minuter propensities,

<P>as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances

<P>been kept more ignorant than myself.&nbsp; He and I have

<P>been at times thrown a good deal together, while you

<P>have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate

<P>principle by my mother.&nbsp; I have seen a great deal of him,

<P>have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on

<P>subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,

<P>I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,

<P>enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,

<P>his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate

<P>and pure.&nbsp; His abilities in every respect improve

<P>as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.

<P>At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;

<P>and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the

<P>expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,

<P>and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.

<P>At present, I know him so well, that I think him

<P>really handsome; or at least, almost so.&nbsp; What say you,

<P>Marianne?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor,
if I

<P>do not now.&nbsp; When you tell me to love him as a brother,

<P>I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do

<P>in his heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor started at this declaration, and was
sorry for

<P>the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.

<P>She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.

<P>She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required

<P>greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction

<P>of their attachment agreeable to her.&nbsp; She knew that

<P>what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,

<P>they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,

<P>and to hope was to expect.&nbsp; She tried to explain the real

<P>state of the case to her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that
I think

<P>very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne here burst forth with indignation--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor!
Oh!

<P>worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.

<P>Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not help laughing.&nbsp; "Excuse
me,"

<P>said she; "and be assured that I meant no offence to you,

<P>by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.

<P>Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;

<P>believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the

<P>suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,

<P>without imprudence or folly.&nbsp; But farther than this you must

<P>not believe.&nbsp; I am by no means assured of his regard for me.

<P>There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;

<P>and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder

<P>at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,

<P>by believing or calling it more than it is.&nbsp; In my heart

<P>I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.

<P>But there are other points to be considered besides

<P>his inclination.&nbsp; He is very far from being independent.

<P>What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's

<P>occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have

<P>never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very

<P>much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there

<P>would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish

<P>to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or

<P>high rank."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was astonished to find how much the
imagination

<P>of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you really are not engaged to him!" said
she.

<P>"Yet it certainly soon will happen.&nbsp; But two advantages

<P>will proceed from this delay.&nbsp; I shall not lose you so soon,

<P>and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving

<P>that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must

<P>be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.

<P>Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to

<P>learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.

<P>She could not consider her partiality for Edward

<P>in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.

<P>There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,

<P>if it did not denote indifference, spoke a something almost

<P>as unpromising.&nbsp; A doubt of her regard, supposing him

<P>to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.

<P>It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind

<P>which frequently attended him.&nbsp; A more reasonable cause

<P>might be found in the dependent situation which forbad

<P>the indulgence of his affection.&nbsp; She knew that his mother

<P>neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable

<P>at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form

<P>a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views

<P>for his aggrandizement.&nbsp; With such a knowledge as this,

<P>it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.

<P>She was far from depending on that result of his preference

<P>of her, which her mother and sister still considered

<P>as certain.&nbsp; Nay, the longer they were together the more

<P>doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,

<P>for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more

<P>than friendship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, whatever might really be its limits, it
was enough,

<P>when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,

<P>and at the same time, (which was still more common,)

<P>to make her uncivil.&nbsp; She took the first opportunity of

<P>affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to

<P>her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,

<P>of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should

<P>marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman

<P>who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could

<P>neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.

<P>She gave her an answer which marked her contempt,

<P>and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might

<P>be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,

<P>her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week

<P>to such insinuations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this state of her spirits, a letter was
delivered

<P>to her from the post, which contained a proposal

<P>particularly well timed.&nbsp; It was the offer of a small house,

<P>on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,

<P>a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.

<P>The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written

<P>in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.

<P>He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;

<P>and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,

<P>he assured her that everything should be done to it which

<P>she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.

<P>He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars

<P>of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to

<P>Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence

<P>she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the

<P>houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,

<P>be made comfortable to her.&nbsp; He seemed really anxious to

<P>accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written

<P>in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure

<P>to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was

<P>suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her

<P>nearer connections.&nbsp; She needed no time for deliberation

<P>or inquiry.&nbsp; Her resolution was formed as she read.

<P>The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from

<P>Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,

<P>would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every

<P>possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its

<P>first recommendation.&nbsp; To quit the neighbourhood of Norland

<P>was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;

<P>it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing

<P>her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever

<P>from that beloved place would be less painful than to

<P>inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.

<P>She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment

<P>of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;

<P>and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,

<P>that she might be secure of their approbation before her

<P>answer were sent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had always thought it would be more
prudent

<P>for them to settle at some distance from Norland,

<P>than immediately amongst their present acquaintance.

<P>On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose

<P>her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.

<P>The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so

<P>simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,

<P>as to leave her no right of objection on either point;

<P>and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought

<P>any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from

<P>the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made

<P>no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter

<P>of acquiescence.
