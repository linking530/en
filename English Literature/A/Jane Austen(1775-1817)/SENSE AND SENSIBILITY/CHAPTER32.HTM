<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the particulars of this conversation were
repeated

<P>by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,

<P>the effect on her was not entirely such as the former

<P>had hoped to see.&nbsp; Not that Marianne appeared to distrust

<P>the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all

<P>with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither

<P>objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,

<P>and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to

<P>be impossible.&nbsp; But though this behaviour assured Elinor

<P>that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to

<P>her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,

<P>in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,

<P>in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,

<P>with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she

<P>saw her spirits less violently irritated than before,

<P>she did not see her less wretched.&nbsp; Her mind did become

<P>settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.

<P>She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily

<P>than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and

<P>desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,

<P>and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been

<P>on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,

<P>that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt

<P>even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,

<P>gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated

<P>by the most open and most frequent confession of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give the feelings or the language of Mrs.
Dashwood

<P>on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only

<P>to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt

<P>and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than

<P>Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.

<P>Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,

<P>arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;

<P>to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat

<P>she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.

<P>Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be,

<P>when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying

<P>and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,

<P>which SHE could wish her not to indulge!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the interest of her own individual
comfort,

<P>Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for

<P>Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton,

<P>where every thing within her view would be bringing back

<P>the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,

<P>by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as

<P>she had always seen him there.&nbsp; She recommended it to

<P>her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their

<P>visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never

<P>exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least

<P>five or six weeks.&nbsp; A variety of occupations, of objects,

<P>and of company, which could not be procured at Barton,

<P>would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,

<P>cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,

<P>and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both

<P>might now be spurned by her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all danger of seeing Willoughby again,

<P>her mother considered her to be at least equally safe

<P>in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must

<P>now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.

<P>Design could never bring them in each other's way:

<P>negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise;

<P>and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London

<P>than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might

<P>force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham

<P>on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at

<P>first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect

<P>as a certain one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had yet another reason for wishing her
children

<P>to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law

<P>had told her that he and his wife were to be in town

<P>before the middle of February, and she judged it right

<P>that they should sometimes see their brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's
opinion,

<P>and she submitted to it therefore without opposition,

<P>though it proved perfectly different from what she wished

<P>and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,

<P>formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her

<P>longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only

<P>possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal

<P>sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and

<P>such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was a matter of great consolation to
her,

<P>that what brought evil to herself would bring good to

<P>her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that

<P>it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely,

<P>comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer

<P>stay would therefore militate against her own happiness,

<P>it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return

<P>into Devonshire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her carefulness in guarding her sister from
ever

<P>hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away.

<P>Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all

<P>its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John,

<P>nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.

<P>Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended

<P>towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was

<P>obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John, could not have thought it possible.

<P>"A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well!

<P>Such a good-natured fellow!&nbsp; He did not believe there was a

<P>bolder rider in England!&nbsp; It was an unaccountable business.

<P>He wished him at the devil with all his heart.&nbsp; He would

<P>not speak another word to him, meet him where he might,

<P>for all the world!&nbsp; No, not if it were to be by the side

<P>of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two

<P>hours together.&nbsp; Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such

<P>a deceitful dog!&nbsp; It was only the last time they met

<P>that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this

<P>was the end of it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.

<P>"She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately,

<P>and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted

<P>with him at all.&nbsp; She wished with all her heart Combe

<P>Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,

<P>for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated

<P>him so much that she was resolved never to mention

<P>his name again, and she should tell everybody she saw,

<P>how good-for-nothing he was."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn
in procuring

<P>all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage,

<P>and communicating them to Elinor.&nbsp; She could soon tell

<P>at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building,

<P>by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn,

<P>and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton

<P>on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits,

<P>oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness

<P>of the others.&nbsp; It was a great comfort to her to be sure

<P>of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their

<P>circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there

<P>was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity

<P>after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every qualification is raised at times, by
the

<P>circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value;

<P>and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence

<P>to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort

<P>than good-nature.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair

<P>about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred

<P>very often, by saying, "It is very shocking, indeed!"

<P>and by the means of this continual though gentle vent,

<P>was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the

<P>first without the smallest emotion, but very soon

<P>to see them without recollecting a word of the matter;

<P>and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex,

<P>and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong

<P>in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend

<P>to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore

<P>determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John)

<P>that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance

<P>and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries

<P>were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.&nbsp; He had abundantly

<P>earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her

<P>sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with

<P>which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always

<P>conversed with confidence.&nbsp; His chief reward for the

<P>painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present

<P>humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which

<P>Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness

<P>of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen)

<P>she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.

<P>THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an

<P>increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave

<P>Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;

<P>but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew

<P>only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that

<P>she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself,

<P>nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the

<P>end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer,

<P>they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the

<P>end of a week that it would not be a match at all.

<P>The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss

<P>Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours

<P>of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,

<P>would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had,

<P>for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in February, within a fortnight from
the

<P>receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful

<P>office of informing her sister that he was married.

<P>She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed

<P>to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony

<P>was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not

<P>receive the first notice of it from the public papers,

<P>which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She received the news with resolute composure;

<P>made no observation on it, and at first shed no tears;

<P>but after a short time they would burst out, and for the

<P>rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable

<P>than when she first learnt to expect the event.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were
married;

<P>and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger

<P>of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister,

<P>who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell,

<P>to go out again by degrees as she had done before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately
arrived

<P>at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings,

<P>Holburn, presented themselves again before their more

<P>grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets;

<P>and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor only was sorry to see them.&nbsp; Their
presence

<P>always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make

<P>a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy

<P>in finding her STILL in town.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have been quite disappointed if I
had not

<P>found you here STILL," said she repeatedly, with a strong

<P>emphasis on the word.&nbsp; "But I always thought I SHOULD.

<P>I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile;

<P>though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should

<P>not stay above a MONTH.&nbsp; But I thought, at the time,

<P>that you would most likely change your mind when it came

<P>to the point.&nbsp; It would have been such a great pity

<P>to have went away before your brother and sister came.

<P>And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.

<P>I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced

<P>to use all her self-command to make it appear that she

<P>did NOT.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how
did

<P>you travel?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss
Steele,

<P>with quick exultation; "we came post all the way, and had

<P>a very smart beau to attend us.&nbsp; Dr. Davies was coming

<P>to town, and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise;

<P>and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve

<P>shillings more than we did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "very pretty,

<P>indeed! and the Doctor is a single man, I warrant you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There now," said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering,

<P>"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I

<P>cannot think why.&nbsp; My cousins say they are sure I have

<P>made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think

<P>about him from one hour's end to another.&nbsp; 'Lord! here

<P>comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day,

<P>when she saw him crossing the street to the house.

<P>My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you mean.

<P>The Doctor is no beau of mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but
it won't do--

<P>the Doctor is the man, I see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, indeed!" replied her cousin, with affected
earnestness,

<P>"and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying

<P>assurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele

<P>was made completely happy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suppose you will go and stay with your brother

<P>and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town,"

<P>said Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints,

<P>to the charge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I do not think we shall."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes, I dare say you will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood
can

<P>spare you both for so long a time together!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long a time, indeed!" interposed Mrs. Jennings.

<P>"Why, their visit is but just begun!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was silenced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss
Dashwood,"

<P>said Miss Steele.&nbsp; "I am sorry she is not well--"

<P>for Marianne had left the room on their arrival.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good.&nbsp; My sister will be
equally

<P>sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has

<P>been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches,

<P>which make her unfit for company or conversation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old

<P>friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US;

<P>and I am sure we would not speak a word."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.

<P>Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her

<P>dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, if that's all," cried Miss Steele, "we
can

<P>just as well go and see HER."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor began to find this impertinence too
much for

<P>her temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it,

<P>by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions,

<P>though it did not give much sweetness to the manners

<P>of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of

<P>the other.
