<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers

<P>announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer,

<P>Esq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very

<P>interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all

<P>those intimate connections who knew it before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's
happiness,

<P>produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time,

<P>and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements

<P>of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much

<P>as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning

<P>as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late

<P>in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular

<P>request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day,

<P>in every day in Conduit Street.&nbsp; For their own comfort

<P>they would much rather have remained, at least all

<P>the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not

<P>a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.

<P>Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton

<P>and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact

<P>was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had too much sense to be desirable companions

<P>to the former; and by the latter they were considered with

<P>a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing

<P>the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.&nbsp; Though nothing

<P>could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to

<P>Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.

<P>Because they neither flattered herself nor her children,

<P>she could not believe them good-natured; and because they

<P>were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps

<P>without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;

<P>but THAT did not signify.&nbsp; It was censure in common use,

<P>and easily given.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their presence was a restraint both on her
and on Lucy.

<P>It checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.

<P>Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them,

<P>and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of

<P>and administer at other times, she feared they would despise

<P>her for offering.&nbsp; Miss Steele was the least discomposed

<P>of the three, by their presence; and it was in their power

<P>to reconcile her to it entirely.&nbsp; Would either of them

<P>only have given her a full and minute account of the whole

<P>affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would

<P>have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice

<P>of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their

<P>arrival occasioned.&nbsp; But this conciliation was not granted;

<P>for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her

<P>sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection

<P>on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect

<P>was produced, but a look of indifference from the former,

<P>or of disgust in the latter.&nbsp; An effort even yet lighter

<P>might have made her their friend.&nbsp; Would they only have

<P>laughed at her about the Doctor!&nbsp; But so little were they,

<P>anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,

<P>that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole

<P>day without hearing any other raillery on the subject,

<P>than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these jealousies and discontents, however,
were so

<P>totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought

<P>it a delightful thing for the girls to be together;

<P>and generally congratulated her young friends every night,

<P>on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.

<P>She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes

<P>at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came

<P>in excellent spirits, full of delight and importance,

<P>attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready

<P>to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,

<P>as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.

<P>One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her

<P>daily complaint.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer maintained the common,

<P>but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;

<P>and though she could plainly perceive, at different times,

<P>the most striking resemblance between this baby and every

<P>one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing

<P>his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it

<P>was not exactly like every other baby of the same age;

<P>nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple

<P>proposition of its being the finest child in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come now to the relation of a misfortune,

<P>which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.

<P>It so happened that while her two sisters with

<P>Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,

<P>another of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance

<P>in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.

<P>But while the imaginations of other people will carry

<P>them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,

<P>and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness

<P>must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.

<P>In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed

<P>her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,

<P>that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,

<P>and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters,

<P>she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;

<P>and this misconstruction produced within a day

<P>or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them

<P>as well as for their brother and sister, to a small

<P>musical party at her house.&nbsp; The consequence of which was,

<P>that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only

<P>to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her

<P>carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,

<P>must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing

<P>to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they

<P>might not expect to go out with her a second time?&nbsp; The power

<P>of disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's.

<P>But that was not enough; for when people are determined

<P>on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel

<P>injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so
much

<P>into the habit of going out every day, that it was become

<P>a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:

<P>and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every

<P>evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest

<P>amusement from any, and very often without knowing,

<P>till the last moment, where it was to take her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To her dress and appearance she was grown so
perfectly

<P>indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,

<P>during the whole of her toilet, which it received from

<P>Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being

<P>together, when it was finished.&nbsp; Nothing escaped HER minute

<P>observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,

<P>and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price

<P>of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the

<P>number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than

<P>Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out

<P>before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,

<P>and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.

<P>The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,

<P>was generally concluded with a compliment, which

<P>though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne

<P>as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing

<P>an examination into the value and make of her gown,

<P>the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,

<P>she was almost sure of being told that upon "her word

<P>she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would

<P>make a great many conquests."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed

<P>on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;

<P>which they were ready to enter five minutes after it

<P>stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable

<P>to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house

<P>of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay

<P>on their part that might inconvenience either herself

<P>or her coachman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The events of this evening were not very remarkable.

<P>The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a

<P>great many people who had real taste for the performance,

<P>and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers

<P>themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,

<P>and that of their immediate friends, the first private

<P>performers in England.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting
to be so,

<P>she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand

<P>pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even

<P>by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix

<P>them at pleasure on any other object in the room.&nbsp; In one

<P>of these excursive glances she perceived among a group

<P>of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture

<P>on toothpick-cases at Gray's.&nbsp; She perceived him soon

<P>afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly

<P>to her brother; and had just determined to find out his

<P>name from the latter, when they both came towards her,

<P>and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted

<P>his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as

<P>words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb

<P>she had heard him described to be by Lucy.&nbsp; Happy had

<P>it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended

<P>less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest

<P>relations!&nbsp; For then his brother's bow must have given

<P>the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother

<P>and sister would have begun.&nbsp; But while she wondered

<P>at the difference of the two young men, she did not find

<P>that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out

<P>of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.

<P>Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself

<P>in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;

<P>for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme

<P>GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing

<P>in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it

<P>much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune

<P>of a private education; while he himself, though probably

<P>without any particular, any material superiority

<P>by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,

<P>was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my soul," he added, "I believe it is
nothing more;

<P>and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving

<P>about it.&nbsp; 'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must

<P>make yourself easy.&nbsp; The evil is now irremediable,

<P>and it has been entirely your own doing.&nbsp; Why would

<P>you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your

<P>own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,

<P>at the most critical time of his life?&nbsp; If you had only sent

<P>him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending

<P>him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'

<P>This is the way in which I always consider the matter,

<P>and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because,

<P>whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage

<P>of a public school, she could not think of Edward's

<P>abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You reside in Devonshire, I think,"--was his

<P>next observation, "in a cottage near Dawlish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor set him right as to its situation;

<P>and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody

<P>could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.

<P>He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their

<P>species of house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For my own part," said he, "I am excessively
fond

<P>of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much

<P>elegance about them.&nbsp; And I protest, if I had any money

<P>to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,

<P>within a short distance of London, where I might drive

<P>myself down at any time, and collect a few friends

<P>about me, and be happy.&nbsp; I advise every body who is going

<P>to build, to build a cottage.&nbsp; My friend Lord Courtland

<P>came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,

<P>and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.

<P>I was to decide on the best of them.&nbsp; 'My dear Courtland,'

<P>said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not

<P>adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.'

<P>And that I fancy, will be the end of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,

<P>no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.

<P>I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.

<P>Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.&nbsp; 'But how can it

<P>be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it

<P>is to be managed.&nbsp; There is not a room in this cottage

<P>that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'

<P>I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,

<P>so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.

<P>The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;

<P>card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library

<P>may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the

<P>supper be set out in the saloon.'&nbsp; Lady Elliott was delighted

<P>with the thought.&nbsp; We measured the dining-room, and found

<P>it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair

<P>was arranged precisely after my plan.&nbsp; So that, in fact,

<P>you see, if people do but know how to set about it,

<P>every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage

<P>as in the most spacious dwelling."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think

<P>he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music
than his

<P>eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on

<P>any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,

<P>which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,

<P>when they got home.&nbsp; The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's mistake,

<P>in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the

<P>propriety of their being really invited to become such,

<P>while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept her from home.

<P>The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;

<P>and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy

<P>of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its

<P>complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.

<P>Fanny was startled at the proposal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not see how it can be done," said she,

<P>"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day

<P>with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.

<P>You know I am always ready to pay them any attention

<P>in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.

<P>But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.&nbsp; How can I ask them

<P>away from her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband, but with great humility, did not
see

<P>the force of her objection.&nbsp; "They had already spent a week

<P>in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton

<P>could not be displeased at their giving the same number

<P>of days to such near relations."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh
vigor, said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love I would ask them with all my heart,
if it

<P>was in my power.&nbsp; But I had just settled within myself

<P>to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.

<P>They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think

<P>the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very

<P>well by Edward.&nbsp; We can ask your sisters some other year,

<P>you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.

<P>I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,

<P>you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they

<P>are such favourites with Harry!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood was convinced.&nbsp; He saw the
necessity

<P>of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience

<P>was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters

<P>another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting

<P>that another year would make the invitation needless,

<P>by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife,

<P>and Marianne as THEIR visitor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of
the ready

<P>wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,

<P>to request her company and her sister's, for some days,

<P>in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.

<P>This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;

<P>cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!

<P>Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,

<P>above all things, the most material to her interest,

<P>and such an invitation the most gratifying to her

<P>feelings!&nbsp; It was an advantage that could not be too

<P>gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;

<P>and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had

<P>any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been

<P>always meant to end in two days' time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was
within ten

<P>minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,

<P>some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark

<P>of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,

<P>seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose

<P>from something more than merely malice against herself;

<P>and might be brought, by time and address, to do

<P>every thing that Lucy wished.&nbsp; Her flattery had already

<P>subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry

<P>into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these

<P>were effects that laid open the probability of greater.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street,
and all

<P>that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened

<P>her expectation of the event.&nbsp; Sir John, who called on

<P>them more than once, brought home such accounts of the

<P>favour they were in, as must be universally striking.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any

<P>young women in her life, as she was with them; had given

<P>each of them a needle book made by some emigrant;

<P>called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know

<P>whether she should ever be able to part with them.
