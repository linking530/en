<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable

<P>had she been able to sleep at all the first night

<P>after parting from Willoughby.&nbsp; She would have been

<P>ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,

<P>had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose

<P>than when she lay down in it.&nbsp; But the feelings which

<P>made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger

<P>of incurring it.&nbsp; She was awake the whole night, and she

<P>wept the greatest part of it.&nbsp; She got up with a headache,

<P>was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;

<P>giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,

<P>and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.

<P>Her sensibility was potent enough!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When breakfast was over she walked out by herself,

<P>and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the

<P>recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present

<P>reverse for the chief of the morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening passed off in the equal indulgence
of feeling.

<P>She played over every favourite song that she had been used

<P>to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices

<P>had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing

<P>on every line of music that he had written out for her,

<P>till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness

<P>could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every

<P>day applied.&nbsp; She spent whole hours at the pianoforte

<P>alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally

<P>suspended by her tears.&nbsp; In books too, as well as in music,

<P>she courted the misery which a contrast between the past

<P>and present was certain of giving.&nbsp; She read nothing

<P>but what they had been used to read together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such violence of affliction indeed could not
be supported

<P>for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;

<P>but these employments, to which she daily recurred,

<P>her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced

<P>occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed
expected

<P>by Marianne.&nbsp; Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again

<P>became uneasy.&nbsp; But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations

<P>whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, Elinor," said she, "how very often
Sir John

<P>fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them

<P>to it.&nbsp; We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,

<P>and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if

<P>their correspondence were to pass through Sir John's hands."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and
she tried

<P>to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.

<P>But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in

<P>her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state

<P>of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,

<P>that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said
she,

<P>"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?&nbsp; From you,

<P>her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question

<P>could not give offence.&nbsp; It would be the natural result

<P>of your affection for her.&nbsp; She used to be all unreserve,

<P>and to you more especially."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would not ask such a question for the world.

<P>Supposing it possible that they are not engaged,

<P>what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!&nbsp; At any

<P>rate it would be most ungenerous.&nbsp; I should never deserve

<P>her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession

<P>of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.

<P>I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me,

<P>and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known,

<P>when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.

<P>I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;

<P>of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent

<P>the denial which her wishes might direct."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,

<P>considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,

<P>but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,

<P>were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was several days before Willoughby's name

<P>was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;

<P>Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;

<P>their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--

<P>but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a

<P>volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our
dear

<P>Willoughby went away before we could get through it.

<P>We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may

<P>be months, perhaps, before THAT happens."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Months!" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.

<P>"No--nor many weeks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;

<P>but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply

<P>from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby

<P>and knowledge of his intentions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning, about a week after his leaving
the country,

<P>Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their

<P>usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.

<P>Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in

<P>her rambles.&nbsp; If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,

<P>she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked

<P>of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,

<P>and could never be found when the others set off.

<P>But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,

<P>who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.&nbsp; They walked

<P>along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,

<P>for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,

<P>satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.

<P>Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,

<P>though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long

<P>stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming

<P>to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,

<P>they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect

<P>which formed the distance of their view from the cottage,

<P>from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any

<P>of their walks before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon
discovered

<P>an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.

<P>In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;

<P>and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and
was

<P>hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.&nbsp;
It is

<P>not Willoughby.&nbsp; The person is not tall enough for him,

<P>and has not his air."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has, he has," cried Marianne, "I am sure
he has.

<P>His air, his coat, his horse.&nbsp; I knew how soon he would come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,

<P>to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost

<P>certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her

<P>pace and kept up with her.&nbsp; They were soon within

<P>thirty yards of the gentleman.&nbsp; Marianne looked again;

<P>her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,

<P>she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters

<P>were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known

<P>as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop,

<P>and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome

<P>Edward Ferrars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the only person in the world who could

<P>at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;

<P>the only one who could have gained a smile from her;

<P>but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her

<P>sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dismounted, and giving his horse to his
servant,

<P>walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely

<P>coming to visit them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,

<P>but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of

<P>regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.

<P>To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister

<P>was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she

<P>had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.

<P>On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency

<P>of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.

<P>He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure

<P>in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,

<P>said little but what was forced from him by questions,

<P>and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.

<P>Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.

<P>She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,

<P>as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her

<P>thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast

<P>sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short silence which succeeded the first

<P>surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked

<P>Edward if he came directly from London.&nbsp; No, he had

<P>been in Devonshire a fortnight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his
being

<P>so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing

<P>her before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked rather distressed as he added, that
he

<P>had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was at Norland about a month ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried
Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably
looks

<P>much as it always does at this time of the year.

<P>The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," cried Marianne, "with what transporting
sensation

<P>have I formerly seen them fall!&nbsp; How have I delighted,

<P>as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me

<P>by the wind!&nbsp; What feelings have they, the season, the air

<P>altogether inspired!&nbsp; Now there is no one to regard them.

<P>They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,

<P>and driven as much as possible from the sight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has
your

<P>passion for dead leaves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; my feelings are not often shared, not
often

<P>understood.&nbsp; But SOMETIMES they are."--As she said this,

<P>she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing

<P>herself again, "Now, Edward," said she, calling his attention

<P>to the prospect, "here is Barton valley.&nbsp; Look up to it,

<P>and be tranquil if you can.&nbsp; Look at those hills!

<P>Did you ever see their equals?&nbsp; To the left is Barton park,

<P>amongst those woods and plantations.&nbsp; You may see the end

<P>of the house.&nbsp; And there, beneath that farthest hill,

<P>which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a beautiful country," he replied; "but
these

<P>bottoms must be dirty in winter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you think of dirt, with such objects
before you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because," replied he, smiling, "among the
rest of the

<P>objects before me, I see a very dirty lane."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How strange!" said Marianne to herself as
she walked on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?&nbsp;
Are the

<P>Middletons pleasant people?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not all," answered Marianne; "we could
not

<P>be more unfortunately situated."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you
say so? How can

<P>you be so unjust?&nbsp; They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars;

<P>and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.&nbsp; Have you

<P>forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how
many

<P>painful moments."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor took no notice of this; and directing

<P>her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support

<P>something like discourse with him, by talking of their

<P>present residence, its conveniences, &amp;c. extorting from him

<P>occasional questions and remarks.&nbsp; His coldness and reserve

<P>mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;

<P>but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past

<P>rather than the present, she avoided every appearance

<P>of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she

<P>thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.
