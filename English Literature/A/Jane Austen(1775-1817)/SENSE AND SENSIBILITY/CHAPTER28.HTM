<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing occurred during the next three or four
days,

<P>to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying

<P>to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.

<P>They were engaged about the end of that time to attend

<P>Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was

<P>kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;

<P>and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,

<P>careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent

<P>whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look

<P>of hope or one expression of pleasure.&nbsp; She sat by the

<P>drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady

<P>Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat,

<P>or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,

<P>and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at

<P>last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them

<P>at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that

<P>any one was expected.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived in due time at the place of destination,

<P>and as soon as the string of carriages before them

<P>would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their

<P>names announced from one landing-place to another in an

<P>audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,

<P>quite full of company, and insufferably hot.&nbsp; When they had

<P>paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady

<P>of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,

<P>and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to

<P>which their arrival must necessarily add.&nbsp; After some time

<P>spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat

<P>down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for

<P>moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,

<P>placed themselves at no great distance from the table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had not remained in this manner long,
before Elinor

<P>perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards

<P>of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable

<P>looking young woman.&nbsp; She soon caught his eye, and he

<P>immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,

<P>or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;

<P>and then continued his discourse with the same lady.

<P>Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether

<P>it could be unobserved by her.&nbsp; At that moment she first

<P>perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with

<P>sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,

<P>had not her sister caught hold of her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "he is there--he

<P>is there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot

<P>I speak to him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "and
do

<P>not betray what you feel to every body present.

<P>Perhaps he has not observed you yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This however was more than she could believe
herself;

<P>and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond

<P>the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.&nbsp; She sat

<P>in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last he turned round again, and regarded
them both;

<P>she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone

<P>of affection, held out her hand to him.&nbsp; He approached,

<P>and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,

<P>as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to

<P>observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after

<P>Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.

<P>Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,

<P>and was unable to say a word.&nbsp; But the feelings of her sister

<P>were instantly expressed.&nbsp; Her face was crimsoned over,

<P>and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,

<P>"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?

<P>Have you not received my letters?&nbsp; Will you not shake

<P>hands with me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed

<P>painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.

<P>During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.

<P>Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression

<P>becoming more tranquil.&nbsp; After a moment's pause, he spoke

<P>with calmness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley

<P>Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was

<P>not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings

<P>at home.&nbsp; My card was not lost, I hope."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But have you not received my notes?" cried
Marianne

<P>in the wildest anxiety.&nbsp; "Here is some mistake I am

<P>sure--some dreadful mistake.&nbsp; What can be the meaning

<P>of it?&nbsp; Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me,

<P>what is the matter?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made no reply; his complexion changed and
all his

<P>embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye

<P>of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,

<P>he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered

<P>himself again, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasure

<P>of receiving the information of your arrival in town,

<P>which you were so good as to send me," turned hastily away

<P>with a slight bow and joined his friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and
unable

<P>to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every

<P>moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the

<P>observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as
she

<P>could speak, "and force him to come to me.&nbsp; Tell him

<P>I must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--

<P>I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this

<P>is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--

<P>Oh go to him this moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,

<P>you must wait.&nbsp; This is not the place for explanations.

<P>Wait only till tomorrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With difficulty however could she prevent her

<P>from following him herself; and to persuade her to check

<P>her agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance

<P>of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy

<P>and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued

<P>incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery

<P>of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.

<P>In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the

<P>door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he

<P>was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again

<P>that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.

<P>She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady

<P>Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable

<P>to stay a minute longer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,

<P>on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too

<P>polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,

<P>and making over her cards to a friend, they departed

<P>as soon the carriage could be found.&nbsp; Scarcely a word

<P>was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.

<P>Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even

<P>for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,

<P>they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn

<P>restored her a little to herself.&nbsp; She was soon undressed

<P>and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,

<P>her sister then left her, and while she waited the return

<P>of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over

<P>the past.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That some kind of engagement had subsisted

<P>between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,

<P>and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;

<P>for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,

<P>SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake

<P>or misapprehension of any kind.&nbsp; Nothing but a thorough

<P>change of sentiment could account for it.&nbsp; Her indignation

<P>would have been still stronger than it was, had she

<P>not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak

<P>a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented

<P>her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been

<P>sporting with the affections of her sister from the first,

<P>without any design that would bear investigation.

<P>Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience

<P>might have determined him to overcome it, but that such

<P>a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself

<P>to doubt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy
a meeting

<P>must already have given her, and on those still more

<P>severe which might await her in its probable consequence,

<P>she could not reflect without the deepest concern.

<P>Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she

<P>could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be

<P>divided in future, her mind might be always supported.

<P>But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil

<P>seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne

<P>in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate

<P>and irreconcilable rupture with him.
