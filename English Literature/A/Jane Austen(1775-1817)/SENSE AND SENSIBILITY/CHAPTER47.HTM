<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication

<P>of her former favourite.&nbsp; She rejoiced in his being

<P>cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was

<P>sorry for him;--she wished him happy.&nbsp; But the feelings

<P>of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore

<P>him with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished,

<P>to Marianne.&nbsp; Nothing could do away the knowledge

<P>of what the latter had suffered through his means,

<P>nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.

<P>Nothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,

<P>nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard
Willoughby's

<P>story from himself--had she witnessed his distress,

<P>and been under the influence of his countenance and his

<P>manner, it is probable that her compassion would have

<P>been greater.&nbsp; But it was neither in Elinor's power,

<P>nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her

<P>retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth

<P>in herself.&nbsp; Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,

<P>and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;--

<P>she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,

<P>and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,

<P>without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the

<P>fancy astray.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, when they were all three together,

<P>Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--

<P>but that it was not without an effort, the restless,

<P>unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time

<P>previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--

<P>and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish to assure you both," said she, "that
I see

<P>every thing--as you can desire me to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly

<P>with soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished

<P>to hear her sister's unbiased opinion, by an eager sign,

<P>engaged her silence.&nbsp; Marianne slowly continued--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told

<P>me this morning--I have now heard exactly what I

<P>wished to hear."--For some moments her voice was lost;

<P>but recovering herself, she added, and with greater

<P>calmness than before--"I am now perfectly satisfied,

<P>I wish for no change.&nbsp; I never could have been happy

<P>with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must

<P>have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence,

<P>no esteem.&nbsp; Nothing could have done it away to my feelings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know it--I know it," cried her mother.

<P>"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one

<P>who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,

<P>and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart

<P>to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her

<P>sensitive counscience, would have felt all that the

<P>conscience of her husband ought to have felt."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne sighed, and repeated, "I wish for
no change."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You consider the matter," said Elinor, "exactly
as

<P>a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;

<P>and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only

<P>in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough

<P>to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you

<P>in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which

<P>you would have been poorly supported by an affection,

<P>on his side, much less certain.&nbsp; Had you married,

<P>you must have been always poor.&nbsp; His expensiveness is

<P>acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares

<P>that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.

<P>His demands and your inexperience together, on a small,

<P>very small income, must have brought on distresses which

<P>would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been

<P>entirely unknown and unthought of before.&nbsp; YOUR sense

<P>of honour and honesty would have led you, I know,

<P>when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy

<P>that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long

<P>as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,

<P>you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--

<P>and how little could the utmost of your single management

<P>do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--

<P>Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,

<P>to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead

<P>of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,

<P>you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,

<P>and made him regret the connection which had involved him

<P>in such difficulties?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated
the word

<P>"Selfish?" in a tone that implied--"do you really think

<P>him selfish?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole of his behaviour," replied Elinor,

<P>"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been

<P>grounded on selfishness.&nbsp; It was selfishness which first

<P>made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,

<P>when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession

<P>of it, and which finally carried him from Barton.

<P>His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,

<P>his ruling principle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very true.&nbsp; MY happiness never
was his object."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets
what he

<P>has done.&nbsp; And why does he regret it?--Because he finds

<P>it has not answered towards himself.&nbsp; It has not made

<P>him happy.&nbsp; His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he

<P>suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only

<P>that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper

<P>than yourself.&nbsp; But does it follow that had he married you,

<P>he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have

<P>been different.&nbsp; He would then have suffered under the

<P>pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,

<P>he now reckons as nothing.&nbsp; He would have had a wife

<P>of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would

<P>have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably

<P>would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts

<P>of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,

<P>even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not a doubt of it," said Marianne;
"and I

<P>have nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,"

<P>said Mrs. Dashwood; "SHE must be answerable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,

<P>satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid

<P>any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's

<P>spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,

<P>immediately continued,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn
from

<P>the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's difficulties

<P>have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his

<P>behaviour to Eliza Williams.&nbsp; That crime has been the origin

<P>of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark;

<P>and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel

<P>Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship

<P>and design could unitedly dictate.&nbsp; Her daughter did

<P>not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on
the two

<P>or three following days, that Marianne did not continue

<P>to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution

<P>was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful

<P>and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect

<P>of time upon her health.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret returned, and the family were again
all

<P>restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;

<P>and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite

<P>so much vigour as when they first came to Barton,

<P>at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.

<P>She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,

<P>nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his

<P>present abode.&nbsp; Some letters had passed between her

<P>and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;

<P>and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--

<P>"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no

<P>enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him

<P>to be still at Oxford;" which was all the intelligence

<P>of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name

<P>was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.

<P>She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of

<P>his measures.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their man-servant had been sent one morning
to Exeter

<P>on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had

<P>satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event

<P>of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars
is married."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes

<P>upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her

<P>chair in hysterics.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she

<P>answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken

<P>the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's

<P>countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment

<P>afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation,

<P>knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne
was

<P>taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,

<P>who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into

<P>the other room.&nbsp; By that time, Marianne was rather better,

<P>and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret

<P>and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still

<P>much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason

<P>and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,

<P>as to the source of his intelligence.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood

<P>immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor

<P>had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married,
Thomas?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning

<P>in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.&nbsp; They was

<P>stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn,

<P>as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park

<P>to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened

<P>to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly

<P>it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat,

<P>and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,

<P>ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne,

<P>and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,

<P>their best compliments and service, and how sorry they

<P>was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was

<P>in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further

<P>down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,

<P>they'd make sure to come and see you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she

<P>had changed her name since she was in these parts.

<P>She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,

<P>and very civil behaved.&nbsp; So, I made free to wish her joy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in
it,

<P>but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much

<P>for talking."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's heart could easily account for his
not

<P>putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably

<P>found the same explanation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was there no one else in the carriage?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am, only they two."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know where they came from?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--

<P>Mrs. Ferrars told me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And are they going farther westward?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.&nbsp; They
will soon

<P>be back again, and then they'd be sure and call here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;

<P>but Elinor knew better than to expect them.

<P>She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was

<P>very confident that Edward would never come near them.

<P>She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they

<P>were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas's intelligence seemed over.&nbsp; Elinor
looked

<P>as if she wished to hear more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you see them off, before you came away?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am--the horses were just coming out,
but I

<P>could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well;

<P>and to my mind she was always a very handsome young

<P>lady--and she seemed vastly contented."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question,

<P>and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,

<P>were soon afterwards dismissed.&nbsp; Marianne had already sent

<P>to say, that she should eat nothing more.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood's

<P>and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret

<P>might think herself very well off, that with so much

<P>uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,

<P>so much reason as they had often had to be careless

<P>of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without

<P>her dinner before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dessert and the wine were arranged,

<P>and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves,

<P>they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness

<P>and silence.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark,

<P>and ventured not to offer consolation.&nbsp; She now found

<P>that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation

<P>of herself; and justly concluded that every thing

<P>had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her

<P>from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then

<P>had suffered for Marianne.&nbsp; She found that she had been

<P>misled by the careful, the considerate attention of

<P>her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she

<P>had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than

<P>she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved

<P>to be.&nbsp; She feared that under this persuasion she had

<P>been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--

<P>that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged,

<P>more immediately before her, had too much engrossed

<P>her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor

<P>she might have a daughter suffering almost as much,

<P>certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.
