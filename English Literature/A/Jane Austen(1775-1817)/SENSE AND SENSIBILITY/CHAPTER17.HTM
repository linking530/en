<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment
at

<P>seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,

<P>of all things the most natural.&nbsp; Her joy and expression

<P>of regard long outlived her wonder.&nbsp; He received the kindest

<P>welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not

<P>stand against such a reception.&nbsp; They had begun to fail him

<P>before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome

<P>by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.&nbsp; Indeed a man

<P>could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,

<P>without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the

<P>satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.

<P>His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,

<P>and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.

<P>He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,

<P>admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still

<P>he was not in spirits.&nbsp; The whole family perceived it,

<P>and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality

<P>in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all

<P>selfish parents.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present,
Edward?"

<P>said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round

<P>the fire; "are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I hope my mother is now convinced that
I have

<P>no more talents than inclination for a public life!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how is your fame to be established? for
famous you

<P>must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination

<P>for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,

<P>and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall not attempt it.&nbsp; I have no wish
to be

<P>distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.

<P>Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have no ambition, I well know.&nbsp; Your
wishes

<P>are all moderate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As moderate as those of the rest of the world,

<P>I believe.&nbsp; I wish as well as every body else to be

<P>perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be

<P>in my own way.&nbsp; Greatness will not make me so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.&nbsp;
"What have

<P>wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but
wealth

<P>has much to do with it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money
can only

<P>give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.

<P>Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,

<P>as far as mere self is concerned."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come

<P>to the same point.&nbsp; YOUR competence and MY wealth

<P>are very much alike, I dare say; and without them,

<P>as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every

<P>kind of external comfort must be wanting.&nbsp; Your ideas

<P>are only more noble than mine.&nbsp; Come, what is your competence?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;

<P>not more than THAT."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor laughed.&nbsp; "TWO thousand a year!
ONE is my

<P>wealth! I guessed how it would end."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate
income,"

<P>said Marianne.&nbsp; "A family cannot well be maintained on

<P>a smaller.&nbsp; I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.

<P>A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,

<P>and hunters, cannot be supported on less."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing

<P>so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hunters!" repeated Edward--"but why must you
have

<P>hunters?&nbsp; Every body does not hunt."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most
people do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel
thought,

<P>"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes

<P>sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing

<P>with the delight of such imaginary happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,"

<P>said Elinor, "in spite of the insufficiency of wealth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should
be!

<P>I wonder what I should do with it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that
point.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune
myself,"

<P>said Mrs. Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich

<P>my help."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must begin your improvements on this house,"

<P>observed Elinor, "and your difficulties will soon vanish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What magnificent orders would travel from
this family

<P>to London," said Edward, "in such an event!&nbsp; What a happy

<P>day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!&nbsp; You,

<P>Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every

<P>new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,

<P>I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough

<P>in London to content her.&nbsp; And books!--Thomson, Cowper,

<P>Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she

<P>would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their

<P>falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every

<P>book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.

<P>Should not you, Marianne?&nbsp; Forgive me, if I am very saucy.

<P>But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our

<P>old disputes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether
it

<P>be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you

<P>will never offend me by talking of former times.

<P>You are very right in supposing how my money would be

<P>spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly

<P>be employed in improving my collection of music and books."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the bulk of your fortune would be laid
out

<P>in annuities on the authors or their heirs."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Edward, I should have something else to
do

<P>with it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward
on that

<P>person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,

<P>that no one can ever be in love more than once in their

<P>life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are
tolerably fixed.

<P>It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,"
said Elinor,

<P>"she is not at all altered."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is only grown a little more grave than
she was."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not
reproach me.

<P>You are not very gay yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should you think so!" replied he, with
a sigh.

<P>"But gaiety never was a part of MY character."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's," said
Elinor;

<P>"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,

<P>very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal

<P>and always with animation--but she is not often really merry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe you are right," he replied, "and
yet I

<P>have always set her down as a lively girl."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have frequently detected myself in such
kind of mistakes,"

<P>said Elinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some

<P>point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,

<P>or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can

<P>hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.

<P>Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,

<P>and very frequently by what other people say of them,

<P>without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I thought it was right, Elinor," said
Marianne,

<P>"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.

<P>I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient

<P>to those of neighbours.&nbsp; This has always been your doctrine,

<P>I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Marianne, never.&nbsp; My doctrine has
never aimed

<P>at the subjection of the understanding.&nbsp; All I have

<P>ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.

<P>You must not confound my meaning.&nbsp; I am guilty, I confess,

<P>of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance

<P>in general with greater attention; but when have I advised

<P>you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their

<P>judgment in serious matters?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have not been able to bring your sister
over to your

<P>plan of general civility," said Edward to Elinor, "Do you gain

<P>no ground?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quite the contrary," replied Elinor,

<P>looking expressively at Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My judgment," he returned, "is all on your
side

<P>of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much

<P>more on your sister's.&nbsp; I never wish to offend, but I

<P>am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,

<P>when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.

<P>I have frequently thought that I must have been intended

<P>by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at

<P>my ease among strangers of gentility!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention

<P>of hers," said Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She knows her own worth too well for false
shame,"

<P>replied Edward.&nbsp; "Shyness is only the effect of a sense

<P>of inferiority in some way or other.&nbsp; If I could persuade

<P>myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,

<P>I should not be shy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you would still be reserved," said Marianne,

<P>"and that is worse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward started--"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, very."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not understand you," replied he, colouring.

<P>"Reserved!--how, in what manner?&nbsp; What am I to tell you?

<P>What can you suppose?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but
trying

<P>to laugh off the subject, she said to him, "Do not you

<P>know my sister well enough to understand what she means?

<P>Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not

<P>talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously

<P>as herself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward made no answer.&nbsp; His gravity and
thoughtfulness

<P>returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat

<P>for some time silent and dull.
