<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned
out

<P>very different from what Elinor had expected.&nbsp; She was

<P>prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened;

<P>but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did

<P>not go at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled
at

<P>the park, where they were to breakfast.&nbsp; The morning

<P>was rather favourable, though it had rained all night,

<P>as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,

<P>and the sun frequently appeared.&nbsp; They were all in high

<P>spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined

<P>to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships

<P>rather than be otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they were at breakfast the letters were
brought in.

<P>Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he

<P>took it, looked at the direction, changed colour,

<P>and immediately left the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir
John.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody could tell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady
Middleton.

<P>"It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel

<P>Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In about five minutes he returned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No bad news, Colonel, I hope;" said Mrs. Jennings,

<P>as soon as he entered the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "None at all, ma'am, I thank you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was it from Avignon?&nbsp; I hope it is not
to say

<P>that your sister is worse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely

<P>a letter of business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how came the hand to discompose you so
much,

<P>if it was only a letter of business?&nbsp; Come, come,

<P>this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect
what

<P>you are saying."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin
Fanny

<P>is married?" said Mrs. Jennings, without attending

<P>to her daughter's reproof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, indeed, it is not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.&nbsp;
And I

<P>hope she is well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whom do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring
a little.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! you know who I mean."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am particularly sorry, ma'am," said he,

<P>addressing Lady Middleton, "that I should receive this

<P>letter today, for it is on business which requires

<P>my immediate attendance in town."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp; "What
can you

<P>have to do in town at this time of year?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My own loss is great," be continued, "in being
obliged

<P>to leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned,

<P>as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance

<P>at Whitwell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a blow upon them all was this!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you write a note to the housekeeper,
Mr. Brandon,"

<P>said Marianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must go," said Sir John.--"It shall not
be put

<P>off when we are so near it.&nbsp; You cannot go to town till

<P>tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish it could be so easily settled.&nbsp;
But it

<P>is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you would but let us know what your business
is,"

<P>said Mrs. Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put

<P>off or not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You would not be six hours later," said Willoughby,

<P>"if you were to defer your journey till our return."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low
voice to Marianne,

<P>"There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.

<P>Brandon is one of them.&nbsp; He was afraid of catching cold

<P>I dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it.

<P>I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no persuading you to change your
mind,

<P>Brandon, I know of old," said Sir John, "when once you

<P>are determined on anything.&nbsp; But, however, I hope you

<P>will think better of it.&nbsp; Consider, here are the two Miss

<P>Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods

<P>walked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up

<P>two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at
being

<P>the cause of disappointing the party; but at the same

<P>time declared it to be unavoidable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, when will you come back again?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope we shall see you at Barton," added
her ladyship,

<P>"as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must

<P>put off the party to Whitwell till you return."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very obliging.&nbsp; But it is so
uncertain,

<P>when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare

<P>not engage for it at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir
John.

<P>"If he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go

<P>after him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings,
"and then

<P>perhaps you may find out what his business is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.

<P>I suppose it is something he is ashamed of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You do not go to town on horseback, do you?"

<P>added Sir John.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Only to Honiton.&nbsp; I shall then go
post."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you

<P>a good journey.&nbsp; But you had better change your mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I assure you it is not in my power."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then took leave of the whole party.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no chance of my seeing you and your
sisters

<P>in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid, none at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I must bid you farewell for a longer
time

<P>than I should wish to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before
you go,

<P>do let us know what you are going about."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wished her a good morning, and, attended
by Sir John,

<P>left the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaints and lamentations which politeness

<P>had hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally;

<P>and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was

<P>to be so disappointed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can guess what his business is, however,"

<P>said Mrs. Jennings exultingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you, ma'am?" said almost every body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What! do not you know who Miss Williams is?
I am

<P>sure you must have heard of her before.&nbsp; She is a relation

<P>of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation.&nbsp; We will

<P>not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies."

<P>Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,

<P>"She is his natural daughter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.

<P>I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily

<P>in the general regret on so unfortunate an event;

<P>concluding however by observing, that as they were

<P>all got together, they must do something by way of

<P>being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,

<P>that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell,

<P>they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving

<P>about the country.&nbsp; The carriages were then ordered;

<P>Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked

<P>happier than when she got into it.&nbsp; He drove through

<P>the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;

<P>and nothing more of them was seen till their return,

<P>which did not happen till after the return of all the rest.

<P>They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said

<P>only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,

<P>while the others went on the downs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was settled that there should be a dance
in the evening,

<P>and that every body should be extremely merry all day long.

<P>Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the

<P>pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir

<P>John observed with great contentment.&nbsp; Willoughby took

<P>his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.

<P>Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not

<P>been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby,

<P>and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,

<P>"I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.

<P>I know where you spent the morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily,

<P>"Where, pray?"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not you know," said Willoughby, "that
we had

<P>been out in my curricle?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very
well,

<P>and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.--

<P>I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.&nbsp; It is a very

<P>large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you

<P>will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much

<P>when I was there six years ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne turned away in great confusion.

<P>Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her

<P>resolution to know where they had been, she had actually

<P>made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom;

<P>and that she had by that method been informed that they

<P>had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there

<P>in walking about the garden and going all over the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could hardly believe this to be true,

<P>as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,

<P>or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was

<P>in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor
enquired

<P>of her about it; and great was her surprise when she

<P>found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings

<P>was perfectly true.&nbsp; Marianne was quite angry with her

<P>for doubting it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did
not

<P>go there, or that we did not see the house?&nbsp; Is not it

<P>what you have often wished to do yourself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs.
Smith

<P>was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Willoughby however is the only person
who can

<P>have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open

<P>carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.

<P>I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness

<P>of an employment does not always evince its propriety."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger
proof

<P>of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety

<P>in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at

<P>the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,

<P>and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed
you

<P>to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin

<P>to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings
are

<P>to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all

<P>offending every moment of our lives.&nbsp; I value not her

<P>censure any more than I should do her commendation.

<P>I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking

<P>over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.

<P>They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,

<P>you would not be justified in what you have done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly

<P>gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of

<P>earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said

<P>with great good humour, "Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather

<P>ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted

<P>particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,

<P>I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room

<P>up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,

<P>and with modern furniture it would be delightful.

<P>It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.

<P>On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind

<P>the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you

<P>have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,

<P>of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.

<P>I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be

<P>more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly

<P>fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,

<P>would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms

<P>in England."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption

<P>from the others, she would have described every room

<P>in the house with equal delight.
