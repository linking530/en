<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barton Park was about half a mile from the
cottage.

<P>The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,

<P>but it was screened from their view at home by the

<P>projection of a hill.&nbsp; The house was large and handsome;

<P>and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality

<P>and elegance.&nbsp; The former was for Sir John's gratification,

<P>the latter for that of his lady.&nbsp; They were scarcely

<P>ever without some friends staying with them in the house,

<P>and they kept more company of every kind than any other

<P>family in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was necessary to the

<P>happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper

<P>and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other

<P>in that total want of talent and taste which confined

<P>their employments, unconnected with such as society produced,

<P>within a very narrow compass.&nbsp; Sir John was a sportsman,

<P>Lady Middleton a mother.&nbsp; He hunted and shot, and she

<P>humoured her children; and these were their only resources.

<P>Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her

<P>children all the year round, while Sir John's independent

<P>employments were in existence only half the time.

<P>Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,

<P>supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;

<P>supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise

<P>to the good breeding of his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance

<P>of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;

<P>and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment

<P>in any of their parties.&nbsp; But Sir John's satisfaction

<P>in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting

<P>about him more young people than his house would hold,

<P>and the noisier they were the better was he pleased.

<P>He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,

<P>for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold

<P>ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private

<P>balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not

<P>suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrival of a new family in the country
was always

<P>a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was

<P>charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his

<P>cottage at Barton.&nbsp; The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,

<P>and unaffected.&nbsp; It was enough to secure his good opinion;

<P>for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could

<P>want to make her mind as captivating as her person.

<P>The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in

<P>accommodating those, whose situation might be considered,

<P>in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.&nbsp; In showing

<P>kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction

<P>of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only

<P>in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;

<P>for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who

<P>are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging

<P>their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at
the door

<P>of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton

<P>Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them

<P>to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern

<P>which the same subject had drawn from him the day before,

<P>at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.

<P>They would see, he said, only one gentleman there

<P>besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at

<P>the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.

<P>He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,

<P>and could assure them it should never happen so again.

<P>He had been to several families that morning in hopes

<P>of procuring some addition to their number, but it

<P>was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.

<P>Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton

<P>within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful

<P>agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find

<P>it so very dull as they might imagine.&nbsp; The young ladies,

<P>as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with

<P>having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for

<P>no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was
a

<P>good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a

<P>great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.&nbsp; She was full

<P>of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said

<P>many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;

<P>hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,

<P>and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.

<P>Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned

<P>her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,

<P>with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than

<P>could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed
no

<P>more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,

<P>than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings

<P>to be Lady Middleton's mother.&nbsp; He was silent and grave.

<P>His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite

<P>of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret

<P>an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side

<P>of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,

<P>his countenance was sensible, and his address was

<P>particularly gentlemanlike.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing in any of the party which
could

<P>recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold

<P>insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive,

<P>that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,

<P>and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his

<P>mother-in-law was interesting.&nbsp; Lady Middleton seemed

<P>to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her

<P>four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,

<P>tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse

<P>except what related to themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, as Marianne was discovered
to be musical,

<P>she was invited to play.&nbsp; The instrument was unlocked,

<P>every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,

<P>who sang very well, at their request went through the

<P>chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into

<P>the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain

<P>ever since in the same position on the pianoforte,

<P>for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving

<P>up music, although by her mother's account, she had

<P>played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's performance was highly applauded.

<P>Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,

<P>and as loud in his conversation with the others while every

<P>song lasted.&nbsp; Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,

<P>wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music

<P>for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song

<P>which Marianne had just finished.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon alone,

<P>of all the party, heard her without being in raptures.

<P>He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt

<P>a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had

<P>reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.

<P>His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that

<P>ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,

<P>was estimable when contrasted against the horrible

<P>insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough

<P>to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have

<P>outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite

<P>power of enjoyment.&nbsp; She was perfectly disposed to make

<P>every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life

<P>which humanity required.
