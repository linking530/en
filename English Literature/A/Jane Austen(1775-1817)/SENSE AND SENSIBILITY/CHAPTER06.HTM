<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first part of their journey was performed
in too

<P>melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious

<P>and unpleasant.&nbsp; But as they drew towards the end of it,

<P>their interest in the appearance of a country which they

<P>were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of

<P>Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.

<P>It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich

<P>in pasture.&nbsp; After winding along it for more than a mile,

<P>they reached their own house.&nbsp; A small green court was

<P>the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate

<P>admitted them into it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was
comfortable

<P>and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the

<P>building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window

<P>shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered

<P>with honeysuckles.&nbsp; A narrow passage led directly through

<P>the house into the garden behind.&nbsp; On each side of the

<P>entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;

<P>and beyond them were the offices and the stairs.

<P>Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.

<P>It had not been built many years and was in good repair.

<P>In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but

<P>the tears which recollection called forth as they entered

<P>the house were soon dried away.&nbsp; They were cheered

<P>by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each

<P>for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.

<P>It was very early in September; the season was fine,

<P>and from first seeing the place under the advantage

<P>of good weather, they received an impression in its

<P>favour which was of material service in recommending

<P>it to their lasting approbation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation of the house was good.&nbsp;
High hills rose

<P>immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;

<P>some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.

<P>The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,

<P>and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.

<P>The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the

<P>whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.

<P>The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated

<P>the valley in that direction; under another name,

<P>and in another course, it branched out again between two

<P>of the steepest of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the size and furniture of the house Mrs.
Dashwood

<P>was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former

<P>style of life rendered many additions to the latter

<P>indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;

<P>and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all

<P>that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.

<P>"As for the house itself, to be sure," said she, "it is

<P>too small for our family, but we will make ourselves

<P>tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late

<P>in the year for improvements.&nbsp; Perhaps in the spring,

<P>if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may

<P>think about building.&nbsp; These parlors are both too small

<P>for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often

<P>collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the

<P>passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,

<P>and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;

<P>this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,

<P>and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug

<P>little cottage.&nbsp; I could wish the stairs were handsome.

<P>But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it

<P>would be no difficult matter to widen them.&nbsp; I shall see

<P>how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring,

<P>and we will plan our improvements accordingly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mean time, till all these alterations
could

<P>be made from the savings of an income of five hundred

<P>a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were

<P>wise enough to be contented with the house as it was;

<P>and each of them was busy in arranging their particular

<P>concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books

<P>and other possessions, to form themselves a home.

<P>Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;

<P>and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their

<P>sitting room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such employments as these they were interrupted

<P>soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of

<P>their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,

<P>and to offer them every accommodation from his own house

<P>and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.

<P>Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.

<P>He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long

<P>for his young cousins to remember him.&nbsp; His countenance

<P>was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were

<P>as friendly as the style of his letter.&nbsp; Their arrival

<P>seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort

<P>to be an object of real solicitude to him.&nbsp; He said much

<P>of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable

<P>terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially

<P>to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better

<P>settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried

<P>to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could

<P>not give offence.&nbsp; His kindness was not confined to words;

<P>for within an hour after he left them, a large basket

<P>full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,

<P>which was followed before the end of the day by a present

<P>of game.&nbsp; He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their

<P>letters to and from the post for them, and would not be

<P>denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper

<P>every day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message
by him,

<P>denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as

<P>she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;

<P>and as this message was answered by an invitation

<P>equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were, of course, very anxious to see a
person on

<P>whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the

<P>elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.

<P>Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;

<P>her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,

<P>and her address graceful.&nbsp; Her manners had all the elegance

<P>which her husband's wanted.&nbsp; But they would have been

<P>improved by some share of his frankness and warmth;

<P>and her visit was long enough to detract something from

<P>their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly

<P>well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say

<P>for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir
John

<P>was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise

<P>precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine

<P>little boy about six years old, by which means there was

<P>one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case

<P>of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,

<P>admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother

<P>answered for him, while he hung about her and held

<P>down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,

<P>who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he

<P>could make noise enough at home.&nbsp; On every formal visit

<P>a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision

<P>for discourse.&nbsp; In the present case it took up ten minutes

<P>to determine whether the boy were most like his father

<P>or mother, and in what particular he resembled either,

<P>for of course every body differed, and every body was

<P>astonished at the opinion of the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An opportunity was soon to be given to the
Dashwoods

<P>of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John

<P>would not leave the house without securing their promise

<P>of dining at the park the next day.
