<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending
a large

<P>portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,

<P>she was not without a settled habitation of her own.

<P>Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success

<P>in a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every

<P>winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square.

<P>Towards this home, she began on the approach of January

<P>to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,

<P>and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses

<P>Dashwood to accompany her.&nbsp; Elinor, without observing

<P>the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look

<P>which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave

<P>a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she

<P>believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations.

<P>The reason alleged was their determined resolution

<P>of not leaving their mother at that time of the year.

<P>Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise,

<P>and repeated her invitation immediately.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare
you

<P>very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with

<P>your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it.

<P>Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me,

<P>for I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you.

<P>It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I

<P>hope I can afford THAT.&nbsp; We three shall be able to go

<P>very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,

<P>if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good,

<P>you may always go with one of my daughters.&nbsp; I am sure

<P>your mother will not object to it; for I have had such

<P>good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she

<P>will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you;

<P>and if I don't get one of you at least well married

<P>before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.

<P>I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,

<P>you may depend upon it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a notion," said Sir John, "that Miss
Marianne

<P>would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister

<P>would come into it.&nbsp; It is very hard indeed that she

<P>should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood

<P>does not wish it.&nbsp; So I would advise you two, to set off

<P>for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying

<P>a word to Miss Dashwood about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall
be

<P>monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss

<P>Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I,

<P>and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to

<P>be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk

<P>to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.

<P>But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have.

<P>Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself,

<P>I who have been always used till this winter to have

<P>Charlotte with me.&nbsp; Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike

<P>hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change

<P>her mind by and bye, why so much the better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you,"
said Marianne,

<P>with warmth: "your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever,

<P>and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest

<P>happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.

<P>But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the

<P>justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be

<P>made less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no,

<P>nothing should tempt me to leave her.&nbsp; It should not,

<P>must not be a struggle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs.
Dashwood

<P>could spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now

<P>understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to

<P>almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness

<P>to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct

<P>opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her

<P>mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected

<P>to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,

<P>which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which

<P>on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.

<P>Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager

<P>to promote--she could not expect to influence the latter

<P>to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she

<P>had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she

<P>dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination

<P>for going to London.&nbsp; That Marianne, fastidious as she was,

<P>thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners,

<P>and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every

<P>inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever

<P>must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her

<P>pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,

<P>so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,

<P>in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood,

<P>persuaded that such an excursion would be productive

<P>of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving

<P>through all her affectionate attention to herself,

<P>how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear

<P>of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on

<P>their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,

<P>with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that

<P>would accrue to them all, from this separation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am delighted with the plan," she cried,

<P>"it is exactly what I could wish.&nbsp; Margaret and I shall

<P>be as much benefited by it as yourselves.&nbsp; When you

<P>and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly

<P>and happily together with our books and our music! You

<P>will find Margaret so improved when you come back again!

<P>I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too,

<P>which may now be performed without any inconvenience

<P>to any one.&nbsp; It is very right that you SHOULD go to town;

<P>I would have every young woman of your condition in life

<P>acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.

<P>You will be under the care of a motherly good sort

<P>of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt.

<P>And in all probability you will see your brother,

<P>and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,

<P>when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so

<P>wholly estranged from each other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,"

<P>said Elinor, "you have been obviating every impediment

<P>to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is

<P>still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so

<P>easily removed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's countenance sunk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear
prudent

<P>Elinor going to suggest?&nbsp; What formidable obstacle is she

<P>now to bring forward?&nbsp; Do let me hear a word about the

<P>expense of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My objection is this; though I think very
well of

<P>Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not a woman whose society

<P>can afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give

<P>us consequence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is very true," replied her mother, "but
of

<P>her society, separately from that of other people,

<P>you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will

<P>almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike
of

<P>Mrs. Jennings," said Marianne, "at least it need not prevent

<P>MY accepting her invitation.&nbsp; I have no such scruples,

<P>and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness

<P>of that kind with very little effort."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not help smiling at this display
of

<P>indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she

<P>had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave

<P>with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,

<P>that if her sister persisted in going, she would

<P>go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne

<P>should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,

<P>or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy

<P>of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.

<P>To this determination she was the more easily reconciled,

<P>by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,

<P>was not to be in town before February; and that

<P>their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,

<P>might be previously finished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will have you BOTH go," said Mrs. Dashwood;

<P>"these objections are nonsensical.&nbsp; You will have much

<P>pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;

<P>and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,

<P>she would foresee it there from a variety of sources;

<P>she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her

<P>acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had often wished for an opportunity
of

<P>attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the

<P>attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might

<P>be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now

<P>on this attack, though almost hopeless of success,

<P>she forced herself to begin her design by saying,

<P>as calmly as she could, "I like Edward Ferrars very much,

<P>and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest

<P>of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference

<P>to me, whether I am ever known to them or not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.

<P>Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor

<P>conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After very little farther discourse, it was
finally

<P>settled that the invitation should be fully accepted.

<P>Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great

<P>deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;

<P>nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.&nbsp; Sir John

<P>was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety

<P>was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,

<P>to the number of inhabitants in London, was something.

<P>Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted,

<P>which was putting herself rather out of her way;

<P>and as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had

<P>never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence

<P>made them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted

<P>her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected

<P>to feel.&nbsp; With regard to herself, it was now a matter

<P>of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when

<P>she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,

<P>and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,

<P>restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more

<P>than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied

<P>with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust

<P>the consequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,

<P>so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her

<P>impatience to be gone.&nbsp; Her unwillingness to quit her

<P>mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the

<P>moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.

<P>Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor

<P>was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider

<P>the separation as any thing short of eternal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their departure took place in the first week
in January.

<P>The Middletons were to follow in about a week.&nbsp; The Miss

<P>Steeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit

<P>it only with the rest of the family.
