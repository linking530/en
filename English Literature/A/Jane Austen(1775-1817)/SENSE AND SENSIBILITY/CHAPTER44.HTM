<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, starting back with a look of horror
at

<P>the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart

<P>in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand

<P>was already on the lock, when its action was suspended

<P>by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather

<P>of command than supplication,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--

<P>I entreat you to stay."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, sir," she replied with firmness, "I shall
NOT stay.

<P>Your business cannot be with ME.&nbsp; The servants, I suppose,

<P>forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had they told me," he cried with vehemence,

<P>"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,

<P>it would not have turned me from the door.&nbsp; My business

<P>is with you, and only you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With me!"--in the utmost amazement--"well,
sir,--

<P>be quick--and if you can--less violent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down, and I will be both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hesitated; she knew not what to do.&nbsp;
The possibility

<P>of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there,

<P>came across her.&nbsp; But she had promised to hear him,

<P>and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.

<P>After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that

<P>prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would

<P>best promote it, she walked silently towards the table,

<P>and sat down.&nbsp; He took the opposite chair, and for half

<P>a minute not a word was said by either.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pray be quick, sir,"--said Elinor, impatiently;--

<P>"I have no time to spare."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,

<P>and seemed not to hear her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister," said he, with abruptness, a
moment

<P>afterwards--"is out of danger.&nbsp; I heard it from the servant.

<P>God be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not speak.&nbsp; He repeated the
inquiry

<P>with yet greater eagerness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger,

<P>or is she not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We hope she is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose up, and walked across the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had I known as much half an hour ago--But

<P>since I AM here,"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he

<P>returned to his seat--"what does it signify?--For once,

<P>Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us

<P>be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--

<P>Tell me honestly"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--

<P>"do you think me most a knave or a fool?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment
than ever.

<P>She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the

<P>strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,

<P>seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression

<P>she immediately rose, saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to
return

<P>to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--

<P>Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better

<P>recollected and explained to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand you," he replied, with an expressive
smile,

<P>and a voice perfectly calm; "yes, I am very drunk.--

<P>A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was

<P>enough to over-set me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At Marlborough!"--cried Elinor, more and more
at

<P>a loss to understand what he would be at.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes,--I left London this morning at eight
o'clock,

<P>and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise

<P>since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence

<P>of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever

<P>other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,

<P>he was not brought there by intoxication, she said,

<P>after a moment's recollection,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly

<P>DO--that after what has passed--your coming here in

<P>this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,

<P>requires a very particular excuse.--What is it,

<P>that you mean by it?"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean,"--said he, with serious energy--"if
I can,

<P>to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.

<P>I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind

<P>of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,

<P>and by convincing you, that though I have been always

<P>a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain

<P>something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the real reason of your coming?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my soul it is,"--was his answer, with
a warmth

<P>which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,

<P>and in spite of herself made her think him sincere.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--

<P>for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Has she?"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--

<P>"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.

<P>But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable

<P>grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor bowed her assent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not know," said he, after a pause of
expectation

<P>on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--"how YOU

<P>may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,

<P>or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--

<P>Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is

<P>worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.

<P>When I first became intimate in your family, I had no

<P>other intention, no other view in the acquaintance

<P>than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain

<P>in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.

<P>Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners

<P>could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost

<P>from the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,

<P>when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my

<P>heart should have been so insensible!&nbsp; But at first

<P>I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.

<P>Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,

<P>giving way to feelings which I had always been too much

<P>in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means

<P>in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any

<P>design of returning her affection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes
on him

<P>with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,

<P>for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.

<P>Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--

<P>Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on

<P>the subject."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I insist on you hearing the whole of it,"
he replied,

<P>"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,

<P>always in the habit of associating with people of better

<P>income than myself.&nbsp; Every year since my coming of age,

<P>or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though

<P>the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;

<P>yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,

<P>it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my

<P>circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.&nbsp; To attach

<P>myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be

<P>thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--

<P>which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,

<P>Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting

<P>in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a

<P>thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said

<P>for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,

<P>I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,

<P>because I did not THEN know what it was to love.

<P>But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I

<P>really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,

<P>to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--

<P>But I have done it.&nbsp; To avoid a comparative poverty,

<P>which her affection and her society would have deprived

<P>of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,

<P>lost every thing that could make it a blessing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You did then," said Elinor, a little softened,

<P>"believe yourself at one time attached to her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To have resisted such attractions, to have
withstood

<P>such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have

<P>done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,

<P>sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life

<P>were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions

<P>were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.

<P>Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying

<P>my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly

<P>to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,

<P>from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement

<P>while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.

<P>I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate

<P>on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling

<P>to engage my faith where my honour was already bound.

<P>The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,

<P>providing with great circumspection for a possible

<P>opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched

<P>for ever.&nbsp; At last, however, my resolution was taken,

<P>and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,

<P>to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,

<P>and openly assure her of an affection which I had already

<P>taken such pains to display.&nbsp; But in the interim--in the

<P>interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I

<P>could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--

<P>a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin

<P>all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.&nbsp; A discovery

<P>took place,"--here he hesitated and looked down.--"Mrs. Smith

<P>had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some

<P>distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of

<P>her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not

<P>explain myself farther," he added, looking at her with an

<P>heightened colour and an enquiring eye--"your particular

<P>intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise,

<P>and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,

<P>"I have heard it all.&nbsp; And how you will explain away any

<P>part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess

<P>is beyond my comprehension."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember," cried Willoughby, "from whom you
received

<P>the account.&nbsp; Could it be an impartial one?&nbsp; I acknowledge

<P>that her situation and her character ought to have been

<P>respected by me.&nbsp; I do not mean to justify myself, but at

<P>the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing

<P>to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,

<P>and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.

<P>If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her

<P>understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.

<P>Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,

<P>with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,

<P>for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.

<P>I wish--I heartily wish it had never been.&nbsp; But I have injured

<P>more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection

<P>for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;

<P>and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate

<P>girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion

<P>of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no

<P>apology for your cruel neglect of her.&nbsp; Do not think yourself

<P>excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding

<P>on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.

<P>You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself

<P>in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,

<P>always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it," he
warmly

<P>replied; "I did not recollect that I had omitted to give

<P>her my direction; and common sense might have told her

<P>how to find it out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She taxed me with the offence at once, and
my confusion

<P>may be guessed.&nbsp; The purity of her life, the formality

<P>of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing

<P>was against me.&nbsp; The matter itself I could not deny,

<P>and vain was every endeavour to soften it.&nbsp; She was

<P>previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my

<P>conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with

<P>the very little attention, the very little portion of my

<P>time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.

<P>In short, it ended in a total breach.&nbsp; By one measure I

<P>might have saved myself.&nbsp; In the height of her morality,

<P>good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would

<P>marry Eliza.&nbsp; That could not be--and I was formally

<P>dismissed from her favour and her house.&nbsp; The night

<P>following this affair--I was to go the next morning--

<P>was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct

<P>should be.&nbsp; The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.

<P>My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her

<P>attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh

<P>that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false

<P>ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally

<P>inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.

<P>I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,

<P>if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think

<P>that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.

<P>A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave

<P>Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;

<P>some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking

<P>this engagement.&nbsp; But whether I should write this apology,

<P>or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.

<P>To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted

<P>whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.

<P>In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,

<P>as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw

<P>her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping

<P>never to see her again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?" said Elinor,

<P>reproachfully; "a note would have answered every purpose.--

<P>Why was it necessary to call?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was necessary to my own pride.&nbsp; I
could not bear

<P>to leave the country in a manner that might lead you,

<P>or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part

<P>of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--

<P>and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,

<P>in my way to Honiton.&nbsp; The sight of your dear sister,

<P>however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,

<P>I found her alone.&nbsp; You were all gone I do not know where.

<P>I had left her only the evening before, so fully,

<P>so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!

<P>A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;

<P>and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I

<P>walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,

<P>delighted with every body!&nbsp; But in this, our last interview

<P>of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt

<P>that almost took from me the power of dissembling.

<P>Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told

<P>her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I

<P>never shall forget it--united too with such reliance,

<P>such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted rascal

<P>I was!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were both silent for a few moments.

<P>Elinor first spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you tell her that you should soon return?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not know what I told her," he replied,
impatiently;

<P>"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all

<P>likelihood much more than was justified by the future.

<P>I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother

<P>to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.

<P>Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.&nbsp; I was miserable.

<P>Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it

<P>gives me to look back on my own misery.&nbsp; I owe such a grudge

<P>to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,

<P>that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and

<P>exultation to me now.&nbsp; Well, I went, left all that I loved,

<P>and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.

<P>My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,

<P>and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my

<P>own reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward

<P>every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,

<P>the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying
him,

<P>grew impatient for his departure, "and this is all?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--

<P>That infamous letter--Did she shew it you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I saw every note that passed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately
did,

<P>for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--

<P>in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more

<P>simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--

<P>my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word

<P>was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,

<P>were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.

<P>To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--

<P>a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof

<P>would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe

<P>they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure

<P>they are dearer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes

<P>in the course of this extraordinary conversation,

<P>was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check

<P>such ideas in her companion as the last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember
that

<P>you are married.&nbsp; Relate only what in your conscience

<P>you think necessary for me to hear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was
still

<P>as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,

<P>many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant

<P>in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy

<P>of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.&nbsp; I say awakened,

<P>because time and London, business and dissipation,

<P>had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing

<P>a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,

<P>and chusing to fancy that she too must have become

<P>indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment

<P>as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders

<P>in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,

<P>overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,

<P>'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--

<P>But this note made me know myself better.&nbsp; I felt that

<P>she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman

<P>in the world, and that I was using her infamously.

<P>But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey

<P>and me.&nbsp; To retreat was impossible.&nbsp; All that I had to do,

<P>was to avoid you both.&nbsp; I sent no answer to Marianne,

<P>intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;

<P>and for some time I was even determined not to call in

<P>Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect

<P>the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,

<P>I watched you all safely out of the house one morning,

<P>and left my name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Watched us out of the house!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even so.&nbsp; You would be surprised to hear
how often

<P>I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling

<P>in with you.&nbsp; I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,

<P>as the carriage drove by.&nbsp; Lodging as I did in Bond Street,

<P>there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse

<P>of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant

<P>watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing

<P>desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us

<P>so long.&nbsp; I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,

<P>as well as everybody else who was likely to prove

<P>an acquaintance in common.&nbsp; Not aware of their being

<P>in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,

<P>the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called

<P>at Mrs. Jennings's.&nbsp; He asked me to a party, a dance at his

<P>house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement

<P>that you and your sister were to be there, I should have

<P>felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.

<P>The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--

<P>still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything

<P>that could make MY conduct most hateful.&nbsp; I could not

<P>answer it.&nbsp; I tried--but could not frame a sentence.

<P>But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.

<P>If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it

<P>was THEN.&nbsp; With my head and heart full of your sister,

<P>I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those

<P>three or four weeks were worse than all.&nbsp; Well, at last,

<P>as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a

<P>sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--

<P>Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me

<P>Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand

<P>to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching

<P>eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and

<P>Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking

<P>all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over now.--

<P>Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;

<P>but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white

<P>as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--

<P>the last manner in which she appeared to me.&nbsp; It was a horrid

<P>sight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,

<P>it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew

<P>exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last

<P>in this world.&nbsp; She was before me, constantly before me,

<P>as I travelled, in the same look and hue."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.

<P>Willoughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let me make haste and be gone.&nbsp;
Your sister

<P>is certainly better, certainly out of danger?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are assured of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter;

<P>have you any thing to say about that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, THAT in particular.&nbsp; Your sister

<P>wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.

<P>You saw what she said.&nbsp; I was breakfasting at the

<P>Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought

<P>to me there from my lodgings.&nbsp; It happened to catch

<P>Sophia's eye before it caught mine--and its size,

<P>the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,

<P>immediately gave her a suspicion.&nbsp; Some vague report had

<P>reached her before of my attachment to some young lady

<P>in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation

<P>the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,

<P>and made her more jealous than ever.&nbsp; Affecting that air

<P>of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman

<P>one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read

<P>its contents.&nbsp; She was well paid for her impudence.

<P>She read what made her wretched.&nbsp; Her wretchedness I could

<P>have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it

<P>must be appeased.&nbsp; And, in short--what do you think of my

<P>wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--

<P>truly feminine--was it not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely
copying

<P>such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.

<P>The original was all her own--her own happy thoughts

<P>and gentle diction.&nbsp; But what could I do!--we were engaged,

<P>every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am

<P>talking like a fool.&nbsp; Preparation!--day!--In honest words,

<P>her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like

<P>mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.

<P>And after all, what did it signify to my character

<P>in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language

<P>my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.

<P>My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether

<P>I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--

<P>'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--' said I to

<P>myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society,

<P>they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter

<P>will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were

<P>my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,

<P>I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics

<P>of Marianne.&nbsp; Her three notes--unluckily they were all

<P>in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,

<P>and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,

<P>and could not even kiss them.&nbsp; And the lock of hair--that too

<P>I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,

<P>which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating

<P>virulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn

<P>from me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,"

<P>said Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself,

<P>betrayed her compassionate emotion; "you ought not to speak

<P>in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister.

<P>You had made your own choice.&nbsp; It was not forced on you.

<P>Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,

<P>at least.&nbsp; She must be attached to you, or she would not

<P>have married you.&nbsp; To treat her with unkindness, to speak

<P>of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I

<P>suppose it a relief to your own conscience."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not talk to me of my wife," said he with
a heavy sigh.--

<P>"She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no

<P>regard for her when we married.--Well, married we were,

<P>and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards

<P>returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me,

<P>Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--

<P>Am I--be it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion

<P>than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong.

<P>Have I explained away any part of my guilt?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you have certainly removed something--a
little.--

<P>You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I

<P>had believed you.&nbsp; You have proved your heart less wicked,

<P>much less wicked.&nbsp; But I hardly know--the misery that

<P>you have inflicted--I hardly know what could have made

<P>it worse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you repeat to your sister when she is
recovered,

<P>what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened

<P>too in her opinion as well as in yours.&nbsp; You tell me that

<P>she has forgiven me already.&nbsp; Let me be able to fancy that

<P>a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings,

<P>will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more

<P>gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.&nbsp; Tell her of my misery

<P>and my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant

<P>to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer

<P>to me than ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will tell her all that is necessary to what
may

<P>comparatively be called, your justification.&nbsp; But you have

<P>not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now,

<P>nor how you heard of her illness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against
Sir

<P>John Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for the first

<P>time these two months--he spoke to me.--That he had cut

<P>me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise

<P>or resentment.&nbsp; Now, however, his good-natured, honest,

<P>stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern

<P>for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling

<P>me what he knew ought to--though probably he did not

<P>think it WOULD--vex me horridly.&nbsp; As bluntly as he could

<P>speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood

<P>was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that

<P>morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger

<P>most imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright,

<P>&amp;c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself

<P>off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John.

<P>His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much

<P>of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,

<P>he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an

<P>old promise about a pointer puppy.&nbsp; What I felt on hearing

<P>that your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me

<P>the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me

<P>in her latest moments--for how could I tell what horrid

<P>projects might not have been imputed?&nbsp; ONE person I

<P>was sure would represent me as capable of any thing--

<P>What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made,

<P>and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage.

<P>Now you know all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor made no answer.&nbsp; Her thoughts were
silently fixed

<P>on the irreparable injury which too early an independence

<P>and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury,

<P>had made in the mind, the character, the happiness,

<P>of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents,

<P>united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a

<P>feeling, affectionate temper.&nbsp; The world had made him

<P>extravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him

<P>cold-hearted and selfish.&nbsp; Vanity, while seeking its own

<P>guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved

<P>him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least

<P>its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.

<P>Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led

<P>him likewise to punishment.&nbsp; The attachment, from which

<P>against honour, against feeling, against every better interest

<P>he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,

<P>governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake

<P>of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister

<P>to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness

<P>to himself of a far more incurable nature.&nbsp; From a reverie

<P>of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes

<P>by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least

<P>equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no use in staying here; I must be
off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going back to town?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No--to Combe Magna.&nbsp; I have business
there;

<P>from thence to town in a day or two.&nbsp; Good bye."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand.&nbsp; She could not refuse
to give

<P>him hers's;--he pressed it with affection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you DO think something better of me than

<P>you did?"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against

<P>the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor assured him that she did;--that she
forgave,

<P>pitied, wished him well--was even interested in his

<P>happiness--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour

<P>most likely to promote it.&nbsp; His answer was not very encouraging.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As to that," said he, "I must rub through
the world

<P>as well as I can.&nbsp; Domestic happiness is out of the question.

<P>If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel

<P>an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it

<P>may put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to

<P>live for.&nbsp; Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.

<P>Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor stopped him with a reproof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well,"--he replied--"once more good bye. I
shall

<P>now go away and live in dread of one event."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister's marriage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very wrong.&nbsp; She can never be
more lost

<P>to you than she is now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she will be gained by some one else.&nbsp;
And if

<P>that some one should be the very he whom, of all others,

<P>I could least bear--but I will not stay to rob myself

<P>of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing

<P>that where I have most injured I can least forgive.

<P>Good bye,--God bless you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with these words, he almost ran out of
the room.
