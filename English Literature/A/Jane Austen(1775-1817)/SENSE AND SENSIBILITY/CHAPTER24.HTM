<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus
began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should be undeserving of the confidence
you have

<P>honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,

<P>or no farther curiosity on its subject.&nbsp; I will

<P>not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," cried Lucy warmly, "for breaking

<P>the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was

<P>somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I

<P>told you that Monday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe
me,"

<P>and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,

<P>"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give

<P>you such an idea.&nbsp; Could you have a motive for the trust,

<P>that was not honourable and flattering to me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her
little

<P>sharp eyes full of meaning, "there seemed to me to be

<P>a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me

<P>quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; I felt sure that you was angry with me;

<P>and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having

<P>took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.

<P>But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,

<P>and that you really do not blame me.&nbsp; If you knew what a

<P>consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you

<P>of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life,

<P>your compassion would make you overlook every thing else

<P>I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a
very great

<P>relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be

<P>assured that you shall never have reason to repent it.

<P>Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to

<P>be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need

<P>of all your mutual affection to support you under them.

<P>Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has only two thousand pounds of his own;
it would

<P>be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,

<P>I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.

<P>I have been always used to a very small income, and could

<P>struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well

<P>to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that

<P>his mother might give him if he married to please her.

<P>We must wait, it may be for many years.&nbsp; With almost every

<P>other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;

<P>but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of

<P>I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That conviction must be every thing to you;

<P>and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your's.

<P>If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed,

<P>as between many people, and under many circumstances

<P>it naturally would during a four years' engagement,

<P>your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful

<P>in guarding her countenance from every expression

<P>that could give her words a suspicious tendency.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Edward's love for me," said Lucy, "has been
pretty

<P>well put to the test, by our long, very long absence

<P>since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial

<P>so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.

<P>I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's

<P>alarm on that account from the first."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh

<P>at this assertion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy went on.&nbsp; "I am rather of a jealous
temper too

<P>by nature, and from our different situations in life,

<P>from his being so much more in the world than me, and our

<P>continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion,

<P>to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been

<P>the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,

<P>or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,

<P>or if he had talked more of one lady than another,

<P>or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he

<P>used to be.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that I am particularly

<P>observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case

<P>I am sure I could not be deceived."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this," thought Elinor, "is very pretty;

<P>but it can impose upon neither of us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what," said she after a short silence,

<P>"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for

<P>Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking

<P>extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this,

<P>and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense

<P>in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk

<P>of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we could be certain that it would be only

<P>for a while!&nbsp; But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong

<P>proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing

<P>it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,

<P>and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away

<P>all my inclination for hasty measures."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And for your own sake too, or you are carrying

<P>your disinterestedness beyond reason."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he

<P>is very unlike his brother--silly and a great coxcomb."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A great coxcomb!" repeated Miss Steele, whose
ear had

<P>caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.--

<P>"Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No sister," cried Lucy, "you are mistaken
there, our

<P>favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is
not,"

<P>said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; "for he is one

<P>of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw;

<P>but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature,

<P>there is no finding out who SHE likes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," cried Miss Steele, looking significantly
round

<P>at them, "I dare say Lucy's beau is quite as modest

<P>and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor blushed in spite of herself.&nbsp; Lucy
bit her lip,

<P>and looked angrily at her sister.&nbsp; A mutual silence took

<P>place for some time.&nbsp; Lucy first put an end to it by saying

<P>in a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them

<P>the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will honestly tell you of one scheme which
has

<P>lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;

<P>indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you

<P>are a party concerned.&nbsp; I dare say you have seen enough

<P>of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every

<P>other profession; now my plan is that he should take

<P>orders as soon as he can, and then through your interest,

<P>which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of

<P>friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me,

<P>your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;

<P>which I understand is a very good one, and the present

<P>incumbent not likely to live a great while.&nbsp; That would

<P>be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time

<P>and chance for the rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should always be happy," replied Elinor,
"to show

<P>any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars;

<P>but do you not perceive that my interest on such an

<P>occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?&nbsp; He is brother

<P>to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough

<P>to her husband."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve

<P>of Edward's going into orders."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I rather suspect that my interest would

<P>do very little."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were again silent for many minutes.&nbsp;
At length

<P>Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe it would be the wisest way to put
an end

<P>to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.

<P>We seem so beset with difficulties on every side,

<P>that though it would make us miserable for a time,

<P>we should be happier perhaps in the end.&nbsp; But you will

<P>not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," answered Elinor, with a smile, which
concealed

<P>very agitated feelings, "on such a subject I certainly

<P>will not.&nbsp; You know very well that my opinion would have

<P>no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great

<P>solemnity; "I know nobody of whose judgment I think

<P>so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe,

<P>that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all means

<P>to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,

<P>it will be more for the happiness of both of you,'

<P>I should resolve upon doing it immediately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's

<P>future wife, and replied, "This compliment would effectually

<P>frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject

<P>had I formed one.&nbsp; It raises my influence much too high;

<P>the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached

<P>is too much for an indifferent person."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Tis because you are an indifferent person,"
said Lucy,

<P>with some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,

<P>"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.

<P>If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect

<P>by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer
to this,

<P>lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase

<P>of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined

<P>never to mention the subject again.&nbsp; Another pause

<P>therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech,

<P>and Lucy was still the first to end it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?"

<P>said she with all her accustomary complacency.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry for that," returned the other,

<P>while her eyes brightened at the information,

<P>"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there!

<P>But I dare say you will go for all that.&nbsp; To be sure,

<P>your brother and sister will ask you to come to them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will not be in my power to accept their
invitation

<P>if they do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How unlucky that is! I had quite depended
upon

<P>meeting you there.&nbsp; Anne and me are to go the latter end

<P>of January to some relations who have been wanting us to

<P>visit them these several years!&nbsp; But I only go for the sake

<P>of seeing Edward.&nbsp; He will be there in February, otherwise

<P>London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was soon called to the card-table by
the

<P>conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential

<P>discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,

<P>to which both of them submitted without any reluctance,

<P>for nothing had been said on either side to make them

<P>dislike each other less than they had done before;

<P>and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy

<P>persuasion that Edward was not only without affection

<P>for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had

<P>not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,

<P>which sincere affection on HER side would have given,

<P>for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man

<P>to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware

<P>that he was weary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this time the subject was never revived
by Elinor,

<P>and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity

<P>of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform

<P>her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter

<P>from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness

<P>and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;

<P>for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which

<P>Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park
was

<P>lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.

<P>Their favour increased; they could not be spared;

<P>Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite

<P>of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter,

<P>in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill

<P>them immediately, which was in full force at the end

<P>of every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two

<P>months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration

<P>of that festival which requires a more than ordinary

<P>share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim

<P>its importance.
