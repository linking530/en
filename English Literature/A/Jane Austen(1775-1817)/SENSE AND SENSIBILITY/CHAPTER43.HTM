<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne got up the next morning at her usual
time;

<P>to every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to

<P>prove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.

<P>But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire

<P>with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,

<P>or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak

<P>much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,

<P>she went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel

<P>Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure,

<P>who, though attending and nursing her the whole day,

<P>against Marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines

<P>on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty

<P>and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very restless and feverish night, however,

<P>disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,

<P>after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable

<P>to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,

<P>Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice,

<P>of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging

<P>Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore

<P>her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder

<P>to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word "infection"

<P>to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,

<P>on her baby's account.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined

<P>from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious

<P>than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report,

<P>and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the

<P>necessity of her immediate removal with her infant;

<P>and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,

<P>found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great

<P>to be withstood.&nbsp; Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;

<P>and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off,

<P>with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a

<P>near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles

<P>on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,

<P>at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;

<P>and whither she was almost equally urgent with her

<P>mother to accompany her.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, however, with a

<P>kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,

<P>declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland

<P>as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,

<P>by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place

<P>of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her

<P>on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,

<P>desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her

<P>better experience in nursing, of material use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature

<P>of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,

<P>could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;

<P>and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,

<P>but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;

<P>for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;

<P>and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,

<P>were to have taken their mother by surprise on the

<P>following forenoon.&nbsp; The little she said was all in

<P>lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried

<P>to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN

<P>really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day produced little or no alteration
in the

<P>state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,

<P>except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.

<P>Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,

<P>though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity

<P>and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be

<P>frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last

<P>by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;

<P>and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,

<P>with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going

<P>likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings

<P>interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away

<P>while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's

<P>account, would be to deprive them both, she thought,

<P>of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once

<P>that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,

<P>that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,

<P>while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &amp;c. she

<P>urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying

<P>the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not

<P>long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's

<P>entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed

<P>to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person

<P>so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance
of all

<P>these arrangements.&nbsp; She knew not that she had been

<P>the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,

<P>in about seven days from the time of their arrival.

<P>It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer;

<P>and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned

<P>her name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's
departure,

<P>and her situation continued, with little variation,

<P>the same.&nbsp; Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,

<P>still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood

<P>was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others

<P>was by no means so cheerful.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings had determined

<P>very early in the seizure that Marianne would never

<P>get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly

<P>of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings,

<P>was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.

<P>He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different

<P>judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;

<P>but the many hours of each day in which he was left

<P>entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission

<P>of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from

<P>his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of the third day however, the
gloomy

<P>anticipations of both were almost done away; for when

<P>Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.

<P>Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable

<P>than on the preceding visit.&nbsp; Elinor, confirmed in every

<P>pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that

<P>in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own

<P>judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light

<P>of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;

<P>and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able

<P>to travel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the day did not close so auspiciously as
it began.--

<P>Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing

<P>more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.

<P>Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to

<P>attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue

<P>of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully

<P>administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with

<P>satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which

<P>she expected the most beneficial effects.&nbsp; Her sleep,

<P>though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,

<P>lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe

<P>the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her

<P>during the whole of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing

<P>of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;

<P>her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating

<P>herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained

<P>alone with Marianne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The repose of the latter became more and more
disturbed;

<P>and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention

<P>her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent

<P>but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,

<P>was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,

<P>when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise

<P>in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,

<P>cried out,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is mama coming?--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet," cried the other, concealing her
terror,

<P>and assisting Marianne to lie down again, "but she will

<P>be here, I hope, before it is long.&nbsp; It is a great way,

<P>you know, from hence to Barton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she must not go round by London," cried
Marianne,

<P>in the same hurried manner.&nbsp; "I shall never see her,

<P>if she goes by London."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not

<P>quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,

<P>eagerly felt her pulse.&nbsp; It was lower and quicker than ever!

<P>and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm

<P>increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending

<P>instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger

<P>to Barton for her mother.&nbsp; To consult with Colonel Brandon

<P>on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought

<P>which immediately followed the resolution of its performance;

<P>and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place

<P>by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,

<P>where she knew he was generally to be found at a much

<P>later hour than the present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was no time for hesitation.&nbsp; Her fears
and her

<P>difficulties were immediately before him.&nbsp; Her fears,

<P>he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--

<P>he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her

<P>difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness

<P>that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service

<P>pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the

<P>messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.&nbsp; Elinor made no

<P>resistance that was not easily overcome.&nbsp; She thanked him

<P>with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went

<P>to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and

<P>an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines

<P>to her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comfort of such a friend at that moment
as Colonel

<P>Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully

<P>was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,

<P>whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might

<P>soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD

<P>be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,

<P>would lessen it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted
with all

<P>the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary

<P>arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated

<P>with exactness the time in which she might look for

<P>his return.&nbsp; Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.

<P>The horses arrived, even before they were expected,

<P>and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look

<P>of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,

<P>hurried into the carriage.&nbsp; It was then about twelve

<P>o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait

<P>for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her

<P>the rest of the night.&nbsp; It was a night of almost equal

<P>suffering to both.&nbsp; Hour after hour passed away in sleepless

<P>pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most

<P>cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.

<P>Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all

<P>her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,

<P>for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,

<P>only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress

<P>had always thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,

<P>fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she

<P>mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of

<P>poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled

<P>with so many days of illness, and wretched for some

<P>immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon

<P>be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,

<P>and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving

<P>too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was on the point of sending again for Mr.
Harris,

<P>or if HE could not come, for some other advice,

<P>when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.

<P>His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,

<P>for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant

<P>alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger

<P>to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh

<P>mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,

<P>in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.&nbsp; He promised

<P>to call again in the course of three or four hours,

<P>and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more

<P>composed than he had found them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With strong concern, and with many reproaches
for not

<P>being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the

<P>morning of what had passed.&nbsp; Her former apprehensions,

<P>now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of

<P>the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,

<P>her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her

<P>to offer the comfort of hope.&nbsp; Her heart was really grieved.

<P>The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,

<P>so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested

<P>person with concern.&nbsp; On Mrs. Jennings's compassion

<P>she had other claims.&nbsp; She had been for three months

<P>her companion, was still under her care, and she was

<P>known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.

<P>The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,

<P>was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings

<P>considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what

<P>Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings

<P>was very sincere.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--

<P>but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the

<P>last would produce.&nbsp; His medicines had failed;--the fever

<P>was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more

<P>herself--remained in a heavy stupor.&nbsp; Elinor, catching all,

<P>and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call

<P>in further advice.&nbsp; But he judged it unnecessary: he had

<P>still something more to try, some more fresh application,

<P>of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his

<P>visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached

<P>the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.

<P>She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;

<P>but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued

<P>till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed,

<P>her thoughts wandering from one image of grief,

<P>one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed

<P>to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,

<P>who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger

<P>of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition

<P>which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.

<P>Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it

<P>gave fresh misery to her reflections.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About noon, however, she began--but with a
caution--a

<P>dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,

<P>even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive

<P>a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited,

<P>watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,

<P>with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,

<P>than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate

<P>her hopes.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,

<P>to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her

<P>young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--

<P>and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,

<P>told herself likewise not to hope.&nbsp; But it was too late.

<P>Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,

<P>she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.

<P>Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom

<P>yet blessed her.&nbsp; Others even arose to confirm it.

<P>Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor

<P>with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on

<P>her with a rational, though languid, gaze.&nbsp; Anxiety and

<P>hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no

<P>moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at

<P>four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on

<P>a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,

<P>gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was in every respect materially better,

<P>and he declared her entirely out of danger.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings,

<P>perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her

<P>forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,

<P>allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,

<P>with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,

<P>the probability of an entire recovery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not be cheerful.&nbsp; Her joy
was of a

<P>different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.

<P>Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her

<P>doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations

<P>of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--

<P>but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,

<P>no smiles.&nbsp; All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction,

<P>silent and strong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued by the side of her sister, with
little

<P>intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,

<P>satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,

<P>supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and

<P>every breath.&nbsp; The possibility of a relapse would of course,

<P>in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--

<P>but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,

<P>that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne

<P>at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all

<P>appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon

<P>might be expected back.&nbsp; At ten o'clock, she trusted,

<P>or at least not much later her mother would be relieved

<P>from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be

<P>travelling towards them.&nbsp; The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely

<P>less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress

<P>of time which yet kept them in ignorance!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly
asleep,

<P>she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.

<P>Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of

<P>dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--

<P>and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings

<P>of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.

<P>Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,

<P>to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to

<P>take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,

<P>no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was

<P>not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.

<P>Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the

<P>sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,

<P>left her there again to her charge and her thoughts,

<P>and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was cold and stormy.&nbsp; The wind
roared

<P>round the house, and the rain beat against the windows;

<P>but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.

<P>Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--

<P>they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clock struck eight.&nbsp; Had it been ten,

<P>Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment

<P>she heard a carriage driving up to the house;

<P>and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite

<P>of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,

<P>that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and

<P>opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.

<P>She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.

<P>The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.

<P>By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it

<P>to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the

<P>excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation

<P>to such unexpected rapidity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult

<P>to be calm, as at that moment.&nbsp; The knowledge of what her

<P>mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--

<P>of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and

<P>of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was

<P>impossible to be calm.&nbsp; All that remained to be done

<P>was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till

<P>she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister,

<P>she hurried down stairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed
along

<P>an inner lobby, assured her that they were already

<P>in the house.&nbsp; She rushed to the drawing-room,--she

<P>entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.
