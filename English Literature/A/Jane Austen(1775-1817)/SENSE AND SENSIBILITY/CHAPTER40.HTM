<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Jennings,

<P>sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,

<P>"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;

<P>for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,

<P>I could not help catching enough to understand his business.

<P>And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,

<P>and I wish you joy of it with all my heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, ma'am," said Elinor.&nbsp; "It
is a matter

<P>of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel

<P>Brandon most sensibly.&nbsp; There are not many men who would

<P>act as he has done.&nbsp; Few people who have so compassionate

<P>a heart!&nbsp; I never was more astonished in my life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord! my dear, you are very modest.&nbsp;
I an't the least

<P>astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought

<P>of late, there was nothing more likely to happen."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's

<P>general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee

<P>that the opportunity would so very soon occur."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jennings--"Oh!
as to that,

<P>when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing,

<P>somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.

<P>Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again;

<P>and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think

<P>I shall soon know where to look for them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,"

<P>said Elinor, with a faint smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.&nbsp; And
as to the house

<P>being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at,

<P>for it is as good a one as ever I saw."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He spoke of its being out of repair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he
repair it?--

<P>who should do it but himself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were interrupted by the servant's coming
in to

<P>announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings

<P>immediately preparing to go, said,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have
had half

<P>my talk out.&nbsp; But, however, we may have it all over in

<P>the evening; for we shall be quite alone.&nbsp; I do not ask

<P>you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full

<P>of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must

<P>long to tell your sister all about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had left the room before the conversation
began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of
it;

<P>but I shall not mention it at present to any body else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! very well," said Mrs. Jennings rather
disappointed.

<P>"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think

<P>of going as far as Holborn to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.

<P>One day's delay will not be very material; and till I

<P>have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be

<P>mentioned to any body else.&nbsp; I shall do THAT directly.

<P>It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,

<P>for he will of course have much to do relative to

<P>his ordination."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings
exceedingly.

<P>Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it

<P>in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.

<P>A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,

<P>and she exclaimed;--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, ho!--I understand you.&nbsp; Mr. Ferrars
is to be

<P>the man.&nbsp; Well, so much the better for him.&nbsp; Ay, to be sure,

<P>he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad

<P>to find things are so forward between you.&nbsp; But, my dear,

<P>is not this rather out of character?&nbsp; Should not the Colonel

<P>write himself?--sure, he is the proper person."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor did not quite understand the beginning
of

<P>Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth

<P>inquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that
he rather

<P>wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars

<P>than himself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And so YOU are forced to do it.&nbsp; Well
THAT is an odd

<P>kind of delicacy!&nbsp; However, I will not disturb you (seeing

<P>her preparing to write.)&nbsp; You know your own concerns best.

<P>So goodby, my dear.&nbsp; I have not heard of any thing to

<P>please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And away she went; but returning again in a
moment,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just been thinking of Betty's sister,
my dear.

<P>I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress.

<P>But whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure I

<P>can't tell.&nbsp; She is an excellent housemaid, and works

<P>very well at her needle.&nbsp; However, you will think of all

<P>that at your leisure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly, ma'am," replied Elinor, not hearing

<P>much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,

<P>than to be mistress of the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How she should begin--how she should express

<P>herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern.

<P>The particular circumstances between them made

<P>a difficulty of that which to any other person would

<P>have been the easiest thing in the world; but she

<P>equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat

<P>deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,

<P>till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her
way to

<P>the carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she,

<P>after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged

<P>him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,

<P>and wanted to speak with him on very particular business.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had just been congratulating herself,

<P>in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it

<P>might be to express herself properly by letter, it was

<P>at least preferable to giving the information by word

<P>of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this

<P>greatest exertion of all.&nbsp; Her astonishment and confusion

<P>were very great on his so sudden appearance.&nbsp; She had

<P>not seen him before since his engagement became public,

<P>and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted

<P>with it; which, with the consciousness of what she

<P>had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,

<P>made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.

<P>He too was much distressed; and they sat down together

<P>in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he

<P>had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming

<P>into the room, he could not recollect; but determining

<P>to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form

<P>as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Jennings told me," said he, "that you
wished

<P>to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I

<P>certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;

<P>though at the same time, I should have been extremely

<P>sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;

<P>especially as it will most likely be some time--it

<P>is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure

<P>of meeting you again.&nbsp; I go to Oxford tomorrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You would not have gone, however," said Elinor,

<P>recovering herself, and determined to get over what she

<P>so much dreaded as soon as possible, "without receiving

<P>our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them

<P>in person.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.

<P>I have something of consequence to inform you of,

<P>which I was on the point of communicating by paper.

<P>I am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing

<P>rather faster than usual as she spoke.)&nbsp; Colonel Brandon,

<P>who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,

<P>that understanding you mean to take orders, he has

<P>great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford

<P>now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.

<P>Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable

<P>and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that

<P>the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much

<P>more considerable, and such as might better enable you

<P>to--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to

<P>yourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views

<P>of happiness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself,

<P>it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.

<P>He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,

<P>such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;

<P>but he said only these two words,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,

<P>as some of the worst was over, "Colonel Brandon means

<P>it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately

<P>passed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable

<P>conduct of your family has placed you--a concern

<P>which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,

<P>must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem

<P>for your general character, and his particular approbation

<P>of your behaviour on the present occasion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it
be possible?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The unkindness of your own relations has made
you

<P>astonished to find friendship any where."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied be, with sudden consciousness,
"not to

<P>find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you,

<P>to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express

<P>it if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very much mistaken.&nbsp; I do assure
you

<P>that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,

<P>to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment

<P>of it.&nbsp; I have had no hand in it.&nbsp; I did not even know,

<P>till I understood his design, that the living was vacant;

<P>nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have

<P>had such a living in his gift.&nbsp; As a friend of mine,

<P>of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,

<P>still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,

<P>you owe nothing to my solicitation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small
share

<P>in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling

<P>to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged

<P>it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix

<P>that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.

<P>For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased

<P>to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth

<P>and respectability.&nbsp; I have always heard him spoken

<P>of as such, and your brother I know esteems him highly.

<P>He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners

<P>perfectly the gentleman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," replied Elinor, "I believe that you
will find him,

<P>on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,

<P>and as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand

<P>the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)

<P>it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward made no answer; but when she had turned

<P>away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,

<P>so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish

<P>the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house

<P>much greater.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James
Street,"

<P>said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor told him the number of the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must hurry away then, to give him those
thanks

<P>which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him

<P>that he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they
parted,

<P>with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing

<P>good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation

<P>that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to

<P>return the same good will, than the power of expressing it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I see him again," said Elinor to herself,

<P>as the door shut him out, "I shall see him the husband

<P>of Lucy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat
down

<P>to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour

<P>to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,

<P>to reflect on her own with discontent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned

<P>from seeing people whom she had never seen before,

<P>and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,

<P>her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret

<P>in her possession, than by anything else, that she

<P>reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear," she cried, "I sent you up
to the

<P>young man.&nbsp; Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had

<P>no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling

<P>to accept your proposal?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For
it seems

<P>all to depend upon that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really," said Elinor, "I know so little of
these kind

<P>of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time,

<P>or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three

<P>months will complete his ordination."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennings;
"Lord! my dear,

<P>how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two

<P>or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME

<P>quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad

<P>to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is

<P>not worth while to wait two or three months for him.

<P>Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well;

<P>somebody that is in orders already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear ma'am," said Elinor, "what can you
be thinking of?--

<P>Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not
mean to persuade

<P>me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving

<P>ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deception could not continue after this;

<P>and an explanation immediately took place, by which both

<P>gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any

<P>material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings

<P>only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still

<P>without forfeiting her expectation of the first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,"
said she,

<P>after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction

<P>was over, "and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear

<P>a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my

<P>knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I

<P>think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--

<P>and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton

<P>cottage!--It seems quite ridiculous.&nbsp; But, my dear, we must

<P>touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,

<P>and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have
any idea

<P>of the living's being enough to allow them to marry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he
has two

<P>thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry

<P>on less.&nbsp; Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall

<P>be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas;

<P>and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the
probability

<P>of their not waiting for any thing more.
