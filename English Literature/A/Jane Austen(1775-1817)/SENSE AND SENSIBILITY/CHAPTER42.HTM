<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other short call in Harley Street, in which
Elinor

<P>received her brother's congratulations on their travelling

<P>so far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel

<P>Brandon's being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two,

<P>completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters

<P>in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come

<P>to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way,

<P>which of all things was the most unlikely to occur,

<P>with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John

<P>to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come

<P>to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting

<P>in the country.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It amused her to observe that all her friends
seemed

<P>determined to send her to Delaford;--a place, in which,

<P>of all others, she would now least chuse to visit, or wish

<P>to reside; for not only was it considered as her future

<P>home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy,

<P>when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit

<P>her there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very early in April, and tolerably early in
the day,

<P>the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set

<P>out from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,

<P>on the road.&nbsp; For the convenience of Charlotte and her child,

<P>they were to be more than two days on their journey,

<P>and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with

<P>Colonel Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after

<P>their arrival.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort

<P>in London, and eager as she had long been to quit it,

<P>could not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to

<P>the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed

<P>those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby,

<P>which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.

<P>Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained,

<P>busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE

<P>could have no share, without shedding many tears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal,

<P>was more positive.&nbsp; She had no such object for her lingering

<P>thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom

<P>it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever,

<P>she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution

<P>of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing

<P>her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage,

<P>and she looked forward with hope to what a few months

<P>of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring

<P>Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their journey was safely performed.&nbsp; The
second

<P>day brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited,

<P>county of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns

<P>in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of the third

<P>they drove up to Cleveland.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,

<P>situated on a sloping lawn.&nbsp; It had no park, but the

<P>pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like

<P>every other place of the same degree of importance,

<P>it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk,

<P>a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,

<P>led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber,

<P>the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir,

<P>the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of

<P>them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,

<P>shut out the offices.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling

<P>with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty

<P>miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;

<P>and before she had been five minutes within its walls,

<P>while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show

<P>her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again,

<P>stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just

<P>beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence;

<P>where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over

<P>a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly

<P>rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon,

<P>and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might

<P>be seen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such moments of precious, invaluable misery,

<P>she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland;

<P>and as she returned by a different circuit to the house,

<P>feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty,

<P>of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude,

<P>she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day

<P>while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of

<P>such solitary rambles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She returned just in time to join the others

<P>as they quitted the house, on an excursion through its

<P>more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was

<P>easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden,

<P>examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the

<P>gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through

<P>the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,

<P>unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,

<P>raised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her

<P>poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her

<P>dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being

<P>stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising

<P>young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne,

<P>in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated

<P>for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland.

<P>With great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented

<P>by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.

<P>She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple,

<P>and perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely

<P>cold or damp would not have deterred her from it;

<P>but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry

<P>or pleasant weather for walking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their party was small, and the hours passed
quietly away.

<P>Mrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work;

<P>they talked of the friends they had left behind,

<P>arranged Lady Middleton's engagements, and wondered

<P>whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther

<P>than Reading that night.&nbsp; Elinor, however little concerned

<P>in it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had

<P>the knack of finding her way in every house to the library,

<P>however it might be avoided by the family in general,

<P>soon procured herself a book.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that
constant

<P>and friendly good humour could do, to make them feel

<P>themselves welcome.&nbsp; The openness and heartiness of her

<P>manner more than atoned for that want of recollection

<P>and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms

<P>of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty

<P>a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident

<P>was not disgusting, because it was not conceited;

<P>and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a
very

<P>late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,

<P>and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a

<P>long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and
in that

<P>little had seen so much variety in his address to her

<P>sister and herself, that she knew not what to expect

<P>to find him in his own family.&nbsp; She found him, however,

<P>perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,

<P>and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother;

<P>she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,

<P>and only prevented from being so always, by too great

<P>an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people

<P>in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings

<P>and Charlotte.&nbsp; For the rest of his character and habits,

<P>they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive,

<P>with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.

<P>He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;

<P>fond of his child, though affecting to slight it;

<P>and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought

<P>to have been devoted to business.&nbsp; She liked him, however,

<P>upon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in

<P>her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--

<P>not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism,

<P>his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency

<P>on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste,

<P>and diffident feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns,

<P>she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,

<P>who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who,

<P>treating her at once as the disinterested friend

<P>of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,

<P>talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford,

<P>described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant

<P>to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour

<P>to her in this, as well as in every other particular,

<P>his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence

<P>of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,

<P>and his deference for her opinion, might very well

<P>justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,

<P>and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,

<P>as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite,

<P>to make her suspect it herself.&nbsp; But as it was,

<P>such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head,

<P>except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could

<P>not help believing herself the nicest observer of the

<P>two;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought

<P>only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious

<P>solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and throat,

<P>the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,

<P>entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;--SHE could

<P>discover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm

<P>of a lover.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two delighful twilight walks on the third and
fourth

<P>evenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel

<P>of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially

<P>in the most distant parts of them, where there was something

<P>more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were

<P>the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,

<P>had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting

<P>in her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold

<P>so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with

<P>or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on

<P>the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.

<P>Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual,

<P>were all declined.&nbsp; Though heavy and feverish, with a pain

<P>in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's

<P>rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty

<P>that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed,

<P>to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.
