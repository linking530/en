<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, for some time after he left her, for
some time

<P>even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained

<P>too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in

<P>themselves, but of which sadness was the general result,

<P>to think even of her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago
she had

<P>abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite

<P>of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration

<P>for the sufferings produced by them, which made her

<P>think of him as now separated for ever from her family,

<P>with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she

<P>soon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to

<P>his merits.&nbsp; She felt that his influence over her mind

<P>was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason

<P>to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,

<P>that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it

<P>was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love

<P>for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.

<P>But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could

<P>feel his influence less.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When at last she returned to the unconscious
Marianne,

<P>she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet

<P>a sleep to the extent of her hopes.&nbsp; Elinor's heart was full.

<P>The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit,

<P>Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival,

<P>threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits

<P>which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made

<P>her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.

<P>Short was the time, however, in which that fear could

<P>affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's

<P>leaving the house, she was again called down stairs

<P>by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her

<P>mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense,

<P>she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward

<P>door just in time to receive and support her as she

<P>entered it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near
the

<P>house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's

<P>being no more, had no voice to inquire after her,

<P>no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for

<P>salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--

<P>and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,

<P>was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she

<P>had been before by her fears.&nbsp; She was supported into

<P>the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--

<P>and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable

<P>to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her

<P>at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look

<P>which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction

<P>of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.

<P>He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than

<P>her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,

<P>to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she

<P>was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever

<P>by absence, unhappiness, and danger.&nbsp; Elinor's delight,

<P>as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked

<P>by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--

<P>but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,

<P>when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,

<P>satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious

<P>of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the

<P>silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,

<P>in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.

<P>But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,

<P>and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to

<P>make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.

<P>Willoughby, "poor Willoughby," as she now allowed

<P>herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she

<P>would not but have heard his vindication for the world,

<P>and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him

<P>so harshly before.&nbsp; But her promise of relating it to her

<P>sister was invariably painful.&nbsp; She dreaded the performance

<P>of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;

<P>doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever

<P>be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby

<P>a widower.&nbsp; Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,

<P>felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more

<P>than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due,

<P>and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton
had been

<P>much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;

<P>for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she

<P>had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that

<P>very day, without waiting for any further intelligence,

<P>and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,

<P>that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch

<P>Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her

<P>where there might be infection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne continued to mend every day, and the
brilliant

<P>cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved

<P>her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of

<P>the happiest women in the world.&nbsp; Elinor could not hear

<P>the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes

<P>wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.

<P>But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account

<P>of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,

<P>was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only

<P>of what would increase it.&nbsp; Marianne was restored to her

<P>from a danger in which, as she now began to feel,

<P>her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate

<P>attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--

<P>and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy

<P>unthought of by Elinor.&nbsp; It was thus imparted to her,

<P>as soon as any opportunity of private conference between

<P>them occurred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At last we are alone.&nbsp; My Elinor, you
do not yet

<P>know all my happiness.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.

<P>He has told me so himself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased
and pained,

<P>surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should

<P>wonder at your composure now.&nbsp; Had I sat down to wish

<P>for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed

<P>on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as the object

<P>most desirable.&nbsp; And I believe Marianne will be the most

<P>happy with him of the two."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason
for thinking so,

<P>because satisfied that none founded on an impartial

<P>consideration of their age, characters, or feelings,

<P>could be given;--but her mother must always be carried

<P>away by her imagination on any interesting subject,

<P>and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He opened his whole heart to me yesterday
as we travelled.

<P>It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.&nbsp; I, you may

<P>well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could

<P>not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,

<P>and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world

<P>now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,

<P>not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible

<P>feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,

<P>affection for Marianne.&nbsp; He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since

<P>the first moment of seeing her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language,

<P>not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural

<P>embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned

<P>every thing delightful to her as it chose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His regard for her, infinitely surpassing
anything

<P>that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,

<P>as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--

<P>has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's

<P>unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and

<P>without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could

<P>he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--

<P>such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived

<P>in HIM."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon's character," said Elinor,

<P>"as an excellent man, is well established."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know it is"--replied her mother seriously,
"or

<P>after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage

<P>such affection, or even to be pleased by it.&nbsp; But his coming

<P>for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,

<P>is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His character, however," answered Elinor,
"does not rest

<P>on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,

<P>were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.

<P>To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long

<P>and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;

<P>and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,

<P>is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,

<P>that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready

<P>as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing

<P>to us in the world.&nbsp; What answer did you give him?--Did you

<P>allow him to hope?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope
to him

<P>or to myself.&nbsp; Marianne might at that moment be dying.

<P>But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.&nbsp; His was

<P>an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion

<P>to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.

<P>Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite

<P>overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,

<P>my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;

<P>and since our arrival, since our delightful security,

<P>I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every

<P>encouragement in my power.&nbsp; Time, a very little time,

<P>I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is

<P>not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--

<P>His own merits must soon secure it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however,

<P>you have not yet made him equally sanguine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No.--He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply

<P>rooted for any change in it under a great length of time,

<P>and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident

<P>of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age

<P>and disposition he could ever attach her.&nbsp; There, however,

<P>he is quite mistaken.&nbsp; His age is only so much beyond

<P>hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and

<P>principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,

<P>is exactly the very one to make your sister happy.

<P>And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.

<P>My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not

<P>so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,

<P>there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--

<P>There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's

<P>eyes at times, which I did not like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,

<P>without waiting for her assent, continued,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And his manners, the Colonel's manners are
not only

<P>more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they

<P>are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching

<P>to Marianne.&nbsp; Their gentleness, their genuine attention

<P>to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity

<P>is much more accordant with her real disposition, than

<P>the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed

<P>of the other.&nbsp; I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby

<P>turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself

<P>the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy

<P>with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree

<P>with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore

<P>gave no offence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance
of me,"

<P>added Mrs. Dashwood, "even if I remain at Barton; and in all

<P>probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there

<P>certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,

<P>that would suit us quite as well as our present situation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting

<P>her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His fortune too!--for at my time of life you
know,

<P>everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know

<P>nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be

<P>a good one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here they were interrupted by the entrance
of a

<P>third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over

<P>in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet

<P>in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.
