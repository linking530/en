<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;

<P>not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every

<P>well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it

<P>produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,

<P>and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that

<P>of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,

<P>she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries

<P>for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;

<P>for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.

<P>But she could hear of no situation that at once answered

<P>her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence

<P>of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected

<P>several houses as too large for their income, which her

<P>mother would have approved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband
of the

<P>solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,

<P>which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.

<P>She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he

<P>had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'

<P>sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was

<P>persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would

<P>support her in affluence.&nbsp; For their brother's sake, too,

<P>for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she

<P>reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,

<P>in believing him incapable of generosity.&nbsp; His attentive

<P>behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that

<P>their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,

<P>she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contempt which she had, very early in their
acquaintance,

<P>felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased

<P>by the farther knowledge of her character, which half

<P>a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps

<P>in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal

<P>affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might

<P>have found it impossible to have lived together so long,

<P>had not a particular circumstance occurred to give

<P>still greater eligibility, according to the opinions

<P>of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This circumstance was a growing attachment
between

<P>her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,

<P>a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced

<P>to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment

<P>at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part

<P>of his time there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy
from

<P>motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son

<P>of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed

<P>it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,

<P>the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.

<P>But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.

<P>It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,

<P>that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned

<P>the partiality.&nbsp; It was contrary to every doctrine of

<P>her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple

<P>asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;

<P>and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged

<P>by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their
good

<P>opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.

<P>He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy

<P>to make them pleasing.&nbsp; He was too diffident to do justice

<P>to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,

<P>his behaviour gave every indication of an open,

<P>affectionate heart.&nbsp; His understanding was good,

<P>and his education had given it solid improvement.

<P>But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition

<P>to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed

<P>to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.

<P>They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some

<P>manner or other.&nbsp; His mother wished to interest him in

<P>political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see

<P>him connected with some of the great men of the day.

<P>Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,

<P>till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would

<P>have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.

<P>But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.

<P>All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet

<P>of private life.&nbsp; Fortunately he had a younger brother

<P>who was more promising.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward had been staying several weeks in the
house

<P>before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;

<P>for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered

<P>her careless of surrounding objects.&nbsp; She saw only that he

<P>was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.

<P>He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by

<P>ill-timed conversation.&nbsp; She was first called to observe

<P>and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor

<P>chanced one day to make on the difference between him

<P>and his sister.&nbsp; It was a contrast which recommended him

<P>most forcibly to her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is enough," said she; "to say that he is
unlike

<P>Fanny is enough.&nbsp; It implies everything amiable.

<P>I love him already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you will like him," said Elinor, "when
you

<P>know more of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like him!" replied her mother with a smile.

<P>"I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may esteem him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never yet known what it was to separate

<P>esteem and love."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted
with him.

<P>Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.

<P>She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion

<P>of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;

<P>but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that

<P>quietness of manner, which militated against all her

<P>established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,

<P>was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be

<P>warm and his temper affectionate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love

<P>in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their

<P>serious attachment as certain, and looked forward

<P>to their marriage as rapidly approaching.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a few months, my dear Marianne." said she,

<P>"Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.

<P>We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love, it will be scarcely a separation.

<P>We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall

<P>meet every day of our lives.&nbsp; You will gain a brother,

<P>a real, affectionate brother.&nbsp; I have the highest opinion

<P>in the world of Edward's heart.&nbsp; But you look grave,

<P>Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's choice?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider it

<P>with some surprise.&nbsp; Edward is very amiable, and I love

<P>him tenderly.&nbsp; But yet--he is not the kind of young

<P>man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;

<P>it has none of that grace which I should expect

<P>in the man who could seriously attach my sister.

<P>His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once

<P>announce virtue and intelligence.&nbsp; And besides all this,

<P>I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.&nbsp; Music seems

<P>scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's

<P>drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person

<P>who can understand their worth.&nbsp; It is evident, in spite of

<P>his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact

<P>he knows nothing of the matter.&nbsp; He admires as a lover,

<P>not as a connoisseur.&nbsp; To satisfy me, those characters

<P>must be united.&nbsp; I could not be happy with a man whose

<P>taste did not in every point coincide with my own.

<P>He must enter into all my feelings; the same books,

<P>the same music must charm us both.&nbsp; Oh! mama, how spiritless,

<P>how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!

<P>I felt for my sister most severely.&nbsp; Yet she bore it

<P>with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.

<P>I could hardly keep my seat.&nbsp; To hear those beautiful lines

<P>which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced

<P>with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He would certainly have done more justice
to

<P>simple and elegant prose.&nbsp; I thought so at the time;

<P>but you WOULD give him Cowper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by
Cowper!--

<P>but we must allow for difference of taste.&nbsp; Elinor has

<P>not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and

<P>be happy with him.&nbsp; But it would have broke MY heart,

<P>had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.

<P>Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced

<P>that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.

<P>I require so much!&nbsp; He must have all Edward's virtues,

<P>and his person and manners must ornament his goodness

<P>with every possible charm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.

<P>It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.

<P>Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?&nbsp; In

<P>one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be

<P>different from her's!"
