<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next
day,

<P>and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain

<P>each other.&nbsp; But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly

<P>got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done

<P>wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause,

<P>at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities,

<P>and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between

<P>husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's

<P>active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some

<P>other new acquaintance to see and observe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had
met with

<P>two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction

<P>of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough

<P>for Sir John to invite them directly to the park,

<P>as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.

<P>Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before

<P>such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into

<P>no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing

<P>that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls

<P>whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--

<P>whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;

<P>for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject

<P>went for nothing at all.&nbsp; Their being her relations too

<P>made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts

<P>at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,

<P>when she advised her daughter not to care about their being

<P>so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put

<P>up with one another.&nbsp; As it was impossible, however, now to

<P>prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the

<P>idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,

<P>contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle

<P>reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young ladies arrived: their appearance
was by

<P>no means ungenteel or unfashionable.&nbsp; Their dress was

<P>very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted

<P>with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,

<P>and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children

<P>that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their

<P>favour before they had been an hour at the Park.

<P>She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,

<P>which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.

<P>Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this

<P>animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage

<P>to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,

<P>and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls

<P>in the world.&nbsp; From such commendation as this, however,

<P>there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew

<P>that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met

<P>with in every part of England, under every possible

<P>variation of form, face, temper and understanding.

<P>Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly

<P>and look at his guests.&nbsp; Benevolent, philanthropic man!&nbsp; It

<P>was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do come now," said he--"pray come--you must
come--I

<P>declare you shall come--You can't think how you will

<P>like them.&nbsp; Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured

<P>and agreeable!&nbsp; The children are all hanging about her already,

<P>as if she was an old acquaintance.&nbsp; And they both long

<P>to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter

<P>that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;

<P>and I have told them it is all very true, and a great

<P>deal more.&nbsp; You will be delighted with them I am sure.

<P>They have brought the whole coach full of playthings

<P>for the children.&nbsp; How can you be so cross as not to come?

<P>Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.

<P>YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must

<P>be related."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Sir John could not prevail.&nbsp; He could
only obtain

<P>a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,

<P>and then left them in amazement at their indifference,

<P>to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the

<P>Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss

<P>Steeles to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When their promised visit to the Park and consequent

<P>introduction to these young ladies took place, they found

<P>in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,

<P>with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;

<P>but in the other, who was not more than two or three

<P>and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her

<P>features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,

<P>and a smartness of air, which though it did not give

<P>actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--

<P>Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon

<P>allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she

<P>saw with what constant and judicious attention they

<P>were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.

<P>With her children they were in continual raptures,

<P>extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring

<P>their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from

<P>the importunate demands which this politeness made on it,

<P>was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,

<P>if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns

<P>of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance

<P>the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.

<P>Fortunately for those who pay their court through

<P>such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise

<P>for her children, the most rapacious of human beings,

<P>is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;

<P>but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive

<P>affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards

<P>her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton

<P>without the smallest surprise or distrust.&nbsp; She saw with

<P>maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments

<P>and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.

<P>She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about

<P>their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives

<P>and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being

<P>a reciprocal enjoyment.&nbsp; It suggested no other surprise

<P>than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,

<P>without claiming a share in what was passing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "John is in such spirits today!" said she,
on his

<P>taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing

<P>it out of window--"He is full of monkey tricks."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently

<P>pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed,

<P>"How playful William is!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And here is my sweet little Annamaria," she
added,

<P>tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,

<P>who had not made a noise for the last two minutes;

<P>"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there

<P>such a quiet little thing!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,

<P>a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching

<P>the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness

<P>such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any

<P>creature professedly noisy.&nbsp; The mother's consternation

<P>was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the

<P>Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three,

<P>in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest

<P>as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.

<P>She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses,

<P>her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the

<P>Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her,

<P>and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.

<P>With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise

<P>to cease crying.&nbsp; She still screamed and sobbed lustily,

<P>kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all

<P>their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton

<P>luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress

<P>last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully

<P>applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly

<P>proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight

<P>intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it,

<P>gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--

<P>She was carried out of the room therefore in her

<P>mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the

<P>two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated

<P>by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies

<P>were left in a quietness which the room had not known for

<P>many hours.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor little creatures!" said Miss Steele,
as soon

<P>as they were gone.&nbsp; "It might have been a very sad accident."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet I hardly know how," cried Marianne, "unless
it

<P>had been under totally different circumstances.

<P>But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there

<P>is nothing to be alarmed at in reality."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said
Lucy Steele.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was silent; it was impossible for
her to say

<P>what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;

<P>and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies

<P>when politeness required it, always fell.&nbsp; She did her

<P>best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton

<P>with more warmth than she felt, though with far less than

<P>Miss Lucy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And Sir John too," cried the elder sister,

<P>"what a charming man he is!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being
only

<P>simple and just, came in without any eclat.&nbsp; She merely

<P>observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what a charming little family they have!&nbsp;
I

<P>never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I

<P>quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always

<P>distractedly fond of children."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should guess so," said Elinor, with a smile,

<P>"from what I have witnessed this morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a notion," said Lucy, "you think the
little

<P>Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the

<P>outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton;

<P>and for my part, I love to see children full of life

<P>and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I confess," replied Elinor, "that while I
am at

<P>Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children

<P>with any abhorrence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short pause succeeded this speech, which
was first

<P>broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed

<P>for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly,

<P>"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?&nbsp; I suppose

<P>you were very sorry to leave Sussex."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some surprise at the familiarity of this
question,

<P>or at least of the manner in which it was spoken,

<P>Elinor replied that she was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is
not it?"

<P>added Miss Steele.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,"

<P>said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary

<P>for the freedom of her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think every one MUST admire it," replied
Elinor,

<P>"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed

<P>that any one can estimate its beauties as we do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And had you a great many smart beaux there?&nbsp;
I

<P>suppose you have not so many in this part of the world;

<P>for my part, I think they are a vast addition always."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why should you think," said Lucy, looking
ashamed

<P>of her sister, "that there are not as many genteel young

<P>men in Devonshire as Sussex?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to
say that there

<P>an't.&nbsp; I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter;

<P>but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there

<P>might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss

<P>Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not

<P>so many as they used to have.&nbsp; But perhaps you young ladies

<P>may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without

<P>them as with them.&nbsp; For my part, I think they are vastly

<P>agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.

<P>But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.&nbsp; Now there's

<P>Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,

<P>quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you

<P>do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--

<P>I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,

<P>before he married, as he was so rich?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word," replied Elinor, "I cannot tell
you,

<P>for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.

<P>But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before

<P>he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest

<P>alteration in him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's
being

<P>beaux--they have something else to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord! Anne," cried her sister, "you can talk
of

<P>nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you

<P>think of nothing else." And then to turn the discourse,

<P>she began admiring the house and the furniture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.

<P>The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left

<P>her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded

<P>by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,

<P>to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left

<P>the house without any wish of knowing them better.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter,
well

<P>provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,

<P>his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly

<P>proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they

<P>declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,

<P>and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom

<P>they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--

<P>And to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found

<P>was their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely

<P>on the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be

<P>too strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy

<P>must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour

<P>or two together in the same room almost every day.

<P>Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any

<P>more was required: to be together was, in his opinion,

<P>to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their

<P>meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being

<P>established friends.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do him justice, he did every thing in his
power

<P>to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles

<P>acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins'

<P>situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor

<P>had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of

<P>them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky

<P>as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she

<P>came to Barton.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Twill be a fine thing to have her married
so young

<P>to be sure," said she, "and I hear he is quite a beau,

<P>and prodigious handsome.&nbsp; And I hope you may have as good

<P>luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend

<P>in the corner already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would
be more

<P>nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward,

<P>than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was

<P>rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat

<P>newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit,

<P>they had never dined together without his drinking to her

<P>best affections with so much significancy and so many nods

<P>and winks, as to excite general attention.&nbsp; The letter F--

<P>had been likewise invariably brought forward, and found

<P>productive of such countless jokes, that its character

<P>as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long

<P>established with Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now
all the

<P>benefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they

<P>raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman

<P>alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,

<P>was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness

<P>into the concerns of their family.&nbsp; But Sir John did not

<P>sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,

<P>for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,

<P>as Miss Steele had in hearing it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible
whisper;

<P>"but pray do not tell it, for it's a great secret."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele; "Mr. Ferrars
is

<P>the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's brother,

<P>Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;

<P>I know him very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who
generally

<P>made an amendment to all her sister's assertions.

<P>"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it

<P>is rather too much to pretend to know him very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.

<P>"And who was this uncle?&nbsp; Where did he live?&nbsp; How came

<P>they acquainted?"&nbsp; She wished very much to have the subject

<P>continued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself;

<P>but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time

<P>in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either

<P>in curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition

<P>to communicate it.&nbsp; The manner in which Miss Steele had

<P>spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck

<P>her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion

<P>of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something

<P>to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing,

<P>for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by

<P>Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.
