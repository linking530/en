<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs.
Dashwood

<P>indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her

<P>son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,

<P>and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were

<P>ready for her inhabiting it.&nbsp; They heard her with surprise.

<P>Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly

<P>hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.

<P>She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going

<P>into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her,

<P>on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,

<P>which required no explanation to her, repeated,

<P>"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?&nbsp; So far from hence!

<P>And to what part of it?"&nbsp; She explained the situation.

<P>It was within four miles northward of Exeter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is but a cottage," she continued, "but
I hope

<P>to see many of my friends in it.&nbsp; A room or two can

<P>easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty

<P>in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find

<P>none in accommodating them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She concluded with a very kind invitation to

<P>Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;

<P>and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.

<P>Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had

<P>made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than

<P>was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect

<P>on her in that point to which it principally tended.

<P>To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her

<P>object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,

<P>by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she

<P>disregarded her disapprobation of the match.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and
again

<P>how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at

<P>such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any

<P>service to her in removing her furniture.&nbsp; He really felt

<P>conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion

<P>to which he had limited the performance of his promise to

<P>his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--

<P>The furniture was all sent around by water.&nbsp; It chiefly

<P>consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,

<P>with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.&nbsp; Mrs. John

<P>Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could

<P>not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income

<P>would be so trifling in comparison with their own,

<P>she should have any handsome article of furniture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth;
it was

<P>ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.

<P>No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she

<P>waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland,

<P>and to determine her future household, before she set

<P>off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid

<P>in the performance of everything that interested her,

<P>was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband

<P>had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity

<P>now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed

<P>to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her

<P>eldest daughter.&nbsp; For the comfort of her children, had she

<P>consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;

<P>but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.&nbsp; HER wisdom

<P>too limited the number of their servants to three;

<P>two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided

<P>from amongst those who had formed their establishment

<P>at Norland.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man and one of the maids were sent off
immediately

<P>into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's

<P>arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown

<P>to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the

<P>cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied

<P>so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house,

<P>as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she

<P>entered it as her own.&nbsp; Her eagerness to be gone from Norland

<P>was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction

<P>of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;

<P>a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed

<P>under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.

<P>Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his

<P>father might with particular propriety be fulfilled.

<P>Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to

<P>the estate, their quitting his house might be looked

<P>on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.

<P>But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every

<P>hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general

<P>drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no

<P>farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.

<P>He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses

<P>of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,

<P>which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond

<P>calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand

<P>in need of more money himself than to have any design of

<P>giving money away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a very few weeks from the day which brought
Sir

<P>John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was

<P>so far settled in their future abode as to enable

<P>Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many were the tears shed by them in their last

<P>adieus to a place so much beloved.&nbsp; "Dear, dear Norland!"

<P>said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,

<P>on the last evening of their being there; "when shall I cease

<P>to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!

<P>happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing

<P>you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view

<P>you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you

<P>will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we

<P>are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we

<P>can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;

<P>unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,

<P>and insensible of any change in those who walk under your

<P>shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?"
