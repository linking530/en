<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.

<P>She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived

<P>to see respectably married, and she had now therefore

<P>nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.

<P>In the promotion of this object she was zealously active,

<P>as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity

<P>of projecting weddings among all the young people

<P>of her acquaintance.&nbsp; She was remarkably quick in the

<P>discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage

<P>of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young

<P>lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;

<P>and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her

<P>arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel

<P>Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.

<P>She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first

<P>evening of their being together, from his listening

<P>so attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit

<P>was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage,

<P>the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.

<P>It must be so.&nbsp; She was perfectly convinced of it.

<P>It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE

<P>was handsome.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see

<P>Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection

<P>with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;

<P>and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every

<P>pretty girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immediate advantage to herself was by no
means

<P>inconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes

<P>against them both.&nbsp; At the park she laughed at the colonel,

<P>and in the cottage at Marianne.&nbsp; To the former her

<P>raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,

<P>perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at

<P>first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,

<P>she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,

<P>or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an

<P>unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years,

<P>and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five
years

<P>younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared

<P>to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear

<P>Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw

<P>ridicule on his age.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity

<P>of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally

<P>ill-natured.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than

<P>Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father;

<P>and if he were ever animated enough to be in love,

<P>must have long outlived every sensation of the kind.

<P>It is too ridiculous!&nbsp; When is a man to be safe from such wit,

<P>if age and infirmity will not protect him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Infirmity!" said Elinor, "do you call Colonel
Brandon

<P>infirm?&nbsp; I can easily suppose that his age may appear much

<P>greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly

<P>deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?

<P>and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dearest child," said her mother, laughing,

<P>"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay;

<P>and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been

<P>extended to the advanced age of forty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mamma, you are not doing me justice.&nbsp;
I know very well

<P>that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends

<P>yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.

<P>He may live twenty years longer.&nbsp; But thirty-five has

<P>nothing to do with matrimony."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Elinor, "thirty-five and seventeen
had

<P>better not have any thing to do with matrimony together.

<P>But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman

<P>who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think

<P>Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his

<P>marrying HER."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne,

<P>after pausing a moment, "can never hope to feel or inspire

<P>affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,

<P>or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might

<P>bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,

<P>for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.

<P>In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be

<P>nothing unsuitable.&nbsp; It would be a compact of convenience,

<P>and the world would be satisfied.&nbsp; In my eyes it would

<P>be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.

<P>To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which

<P>each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor,

<P>"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could

<P>feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough

<P>to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.

<P>But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and

<P>his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,

<P>merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a

<P>very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one

<P>of his shoulders."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said
Marianne;

<P>"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected

<P>with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of

<P>ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had he been only in a violent fever, you would
not

<P>have despised him half so much.&nbsp; Confess, Marianne, is not

<P>there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,

<P>hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the
room,

<P>"Mamma," said Marianne, "I have an alarm on the subject

<P>of illness which I cannot conceal from you.&nbsp; I am sure

<P>Edward Ferrars is not well.&nbsp; We have now been here almost

<P>a fortnight, and yet he does not come.&nbsp; Nothing but real

<P>indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.

<P>What else can detain him at Norland?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had you any idea of his coming so soon?"

<P>said Mrs. Dashwood.&nbsp; "I had none.&nbsp; On the contrary,

<P>if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has

<P>been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want

<P>of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,

<P>when I talked of his coming to Barton.&nbsp; Does Elinor

<P>expect him already?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never mentioned it to her, but of course

<P>she must."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I rather think you are mistaken, for when
I

<P>was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate

<P>for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there

<P>was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely

<P>that the room would be wanted for some time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How strange this is! what can be the meaning
of it!

<P>But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been

<P>unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last

<P>adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening

<P>of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no

<P>distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes

<P>of an affectionate brother to both.&nbsp; Twice did I leave

<P>them purposely together in the course of the last morning,

<P>and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out

<P>of the room.&nbsp; And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,

<P>cried not as I did.&nbsp; Even now her self-command is invariable.

<P>When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try

<P>to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied

<P>in it?"
