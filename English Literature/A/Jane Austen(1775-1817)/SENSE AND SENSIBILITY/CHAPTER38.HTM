<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of
Edward's

<P>conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its

<P>true merit.&nbsp; THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt

<P>him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,

<P>beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could

<P>remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.

<P>Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all

<P>his offences in compassion for his punishment.&nbsp; But though

<P>confidence between them was, by this public discovery,

<P>restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on

<P>which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.

<P>Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still

<P>more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive

<P>assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued

<P>affection for herself which she rather wished to do away;

<P>and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying

<P>to converse upon a topic which always left her more

<P>dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison

<P>it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt all the force of that comparison;
but not

<P>as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;

<P>she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,

<P>regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted

<P>herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,

<P>without the hope of amendment.&nbsp; Her mind was so much weakened

<P>that she still fancied present exertion impossible,

<P>and therefore it only dispirited her more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or
two afterwards,

<P>of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.

<P>But though so much of the matter was known to them already,

<P>that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading

<P>that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,

<P>she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort

<P>and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;

<P>and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,

<P>had prevented her going to them within that time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third day succeeding their knowledge of
the

<P>particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw

<P>many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second

<P>week in March.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;

<P>but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again

<P>in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,

<P>chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public

<P>a place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined

<P>them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was

<P>not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging

<P>all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left

<P>to quiet reflection.&nbsp; She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,

<P>nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody

<P>who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting

<P>to her.&nbsp; But at last she found herself with some surprise,

<P>accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,

<P>expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving

<P>encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,

<P>left her own party for a short time, to join their's.

<P>Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it all out of her, my dear.&nbsp; She
will tell you

<P>any thing if you ask.&nbsp; You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's
curiosity

<P>and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT

<P>being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so glad to meet you;" said Miss Steele,

<P>taking her familiarly by the arm--"for I wanted to see you

<P>of all things in the world."&nbsp; And then lowering her voice,

<P>"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.

<P>Is she angry?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all, I believe, with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a good thing.&nbsp; And Lady Middleton,
is SHE angry?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot suppose it possible that she should."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am monstrous glad of it.&nbsp; Good gracious!&nbsp;
I have

<P>had such a time of it!&nbsp; I never saw Lucy in such a rage

<P>in my life.&nbsp; She vowed at first she would never trim me

<P>up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,

<P>so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,

<P>and we are as good friends as ever.&nbsp; Look, she made me

<P>this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.

<P>There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.&nbsp; But why

<P>should not I wear pink ribbons?&nbsp; I do not care if it IS

<P>the Doctor's favourite colour.&nbsp; I am sure, for my part,

<P>I should never have known he DID like it better than

<P>any other colour, if he had not happened to say so.

<P>My cousins have been so plaguing me!&nbsp; I declare sometimes

<P>I do not know which way to look before them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had wandered away to a subject on which
Elinor

<P>had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient

<P>to find her way back again to the first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, but Miss Dashwood," speaking triumphantly,

<P>"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's

<P>declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing

<P>I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured

<P>reports to be spread abroad.&nbsp; Whatever Lucy might think

<P>about it herself, you know, it was no business of other

<P>people to set it down for certain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never heard any thing of the kind hinted
at before,

<P>I assure you," said Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, did not you?&nbsp; But it WAS said, I
know, very well,

<P>and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,

<P>that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars

<P>to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand

<P>pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had

<P>nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.

<P>And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,

<P>that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars

<P>would be off; and when Edward did not come near us

<P>for three days, I could not tell what to think myself;

<P>and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;

<P>for we came away from your brother's Wednesday,

<P>and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,

<P>and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.

<P>Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits

<P>rose against that.&nbsp; However this morning he came just

<P>as we came home from church; and then it all came out,

<P>how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,

<P>and been talked to by his mother and all of them,

<P>and how he had declared before them all that he loved

<P>nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.

<P>And how he had been so worried by what passed,

<P>that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,

<P>he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,

<P>some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn

<P>all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better

<P>of it.&nbsp; And after thinking it all over and over again,

<P>he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,

<P>and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep

<P>her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,

<P>for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope

<P>of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,

<P>as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,

<P>and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear

<P>to think of her doing no better, and so he begged,

<P>if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the

<P>matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.

<P>I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.

<P>And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,

<P>that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.

<P>I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being

<P>tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any

<P>thing like it.&nbsp; But, to be sure, Lucy would not give

<P>ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly

<P>(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,

<P>and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things

<P>you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least

<P>mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him

<P>upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,

<P>she should be very glad to have it all, you know,

<P>or something of the kind.&nbsp; So then he was monstrous happy,

<P>and talked on some time about what they should do,

<P>and they agreed he should take orders directly,

<P>and they must wait to be married till he got a living.

<P>And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin

<P>called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in

<P>her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;

<P>so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,

<P>to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not

<P>care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put

<P>on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the

<P>Richardsons."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not understand what you mean by interrupting
them,"

<P>said Elinor; "you were all in the same room together,

<P>were not you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, indeed, not us.&nbsp; La! Miss Dashwood,
do you

<P>think people make love when any body else is by?&nbsp; Oh,

<P>for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.

<P>(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the

<P>drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening

<P>at the door."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How!" cried Elinor; "have you been repeating
to me

<P>what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?

<P>I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly

<P>would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a

<P>conversation which you ought not to have known yourself.

<P>How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.&nbsp; I
only stood at

<P>the door, and heard what I could.&nbsp; And I am sure Lucy would

<P>have done just the same by me; for a year or two back,

<P>when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,

<P>she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind

<P>a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tried to talk of something else; but
Miss

<P>Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,

<P>from what was uppermost in her mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Edward talks of going to Oxford soon," said
she;

<P>"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.&nbsp; What an

<P>ill-natured woman his monther is, an't she? And your

<P>brother and sister were not very kind! However,

<P>I shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure

<P>they did send us home in their own chariot, which

<P>was more than I looked for.&nbsp; And for my part, I was all

<P>in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the

<P>huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,

<P>nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine

<P>out of sight.&nbsp; Edward have got some business at Oxford,

<P>he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,

<P>as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.

<P>I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!

<P>(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what

<P>my cousins will say, when they hear of it.&nbsp; They will

<P>tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward

<P>the curacy of his new living.&nbsp; I know they will; but I am

<P>sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.--

<P>'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think

<P>of such a thing?&nbsp; I write to the Doctor, indeed!'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," said Elinor, "it is a comfort to be
prepared

<P>against the worst.&nbsp; You have got your answer ready."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Steele was going to reply on the same
subject,

<P>but the approach of her own party made another more necessary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.&nbsp; I
had a vast deal

<P>more to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not

<P>any longer.&nbsp; I assure you they are very genteel people.

<P>He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their

<P>own coach.&nbsp; I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about

<P>it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she

<P>is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same;

<P>and if anything should happen to take you and your

<P>sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company,

<P>I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her

<P>for as long a time as she likes.&nbsp; I suppose Lady Middleton

<P>won't ask us any more this bout.&nbsp; Good-by; I am sorry

<P>Miss Marianne was not here.&nbsp; Remember me kindly to her.

<P>La! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder

<P>you was not afraid of its being torn."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was her parting concern; for after this,
she had

<P>time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,

<P>before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson;

<P>and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which

<P>might feed her powers of reflection some time, though she

<P>had learnt very little more than what had been already

<P>foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind.&nbsp; Edward's marriage

<P>with Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time

<P>of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,

<P>as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,

<P>exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,

<P>of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they returned to the carriage,

<P>Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor

<P>wished to spread as little as possible intelligence

<P>that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,

<P>she confined herself to the brief repetition of such

<P>simple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy,

<P>for the sake of her own consequence, would choose

<P>to have known.&nbsp; The continuance of their engagement,

<P>and the means that were able to be taken for promoting

<P>its end, was all her communication; and this produced

<P>from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all
know how

<P>THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding

<P>no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty

<P>pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,

<P>and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can

<P>give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and

<P>Lord help 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see

<P>what I can give them towards furnishing their house.

<P>Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t'other

<P>day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.--

<P>Betty's sister would never do for them NOW."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning brought Elinor a letter by
the

<P>two-penny post from Lucy herself.&nbsp; It was as follows:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Bartlett's Building, March.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope my dear
Miss Dashwood will excuse the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liberty I take of writing to her; but I know
your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship for me will make you pleased to
hear such

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good account of myself and my dear Edward,
after

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the troubles we have went through lately,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore will make no more apologies, but
proceed

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to say that, thank God! though we have suffered

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and
as happy

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as we must always be in one another's love.&nbsp;
We have

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had great trials, and great persecutions, but

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many friends, yourself not the least among
them,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose great kindness I shall always thankfully

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remember, as will Edward too, who I have told
of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.&nbsp; I am sure you will be glad to hear,
as likewise

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours
with

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear
of our

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought
my

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duty required, urge him to it for prudence
sake,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and would have parted for ever on the spot,
would

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he consent to it; but he said it should never
be,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he did not regard his mother's anger, while
he could

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have my affections; our prospects are not very

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope
for

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best; he will be ordained shortly; and
should

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it ever be in your power to recommend him to
any

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body that has a living to bestow, am very sure
you

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings
too,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trust she will speak a good word for us to
Sir John,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able
to

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for
what

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she did, but she did it for the best, so I
say

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it
too much

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trouble to give us a call, should she come
this way

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and
my

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper
reminds

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and respectfully remembered to her, and to
Sir John,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Lady Middleton, and the dear children,
when you

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,

"I am, &amp;c."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed

<P>what she concluded to be its writer's real design,

<P>by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it

<P>aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye,

<P>that was quite proper to let him be off if he would.

<P>That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get

<P>him a living, with all my heart.--She calls me dear

<P>Mrs. Jennings, you see.&nbsp; She is a good-hearted girl

<P>as ever lived.--Very well upon my word.&nbsp; That sentence

<P>is very prettily turned.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I will go and see her,

<P>sure enough.&nbsp; How attentive she is, to think of every

<P>body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.&nbsp; It is

<P>as pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head

<P>and heart great credit."
