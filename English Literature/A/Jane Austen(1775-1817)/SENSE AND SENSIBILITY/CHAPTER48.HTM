<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor now found the difference between the
expectation

<P>of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told

<P>to consider it, and certainty itself.&nbsp; She now found, that

<P>in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,

<P>while Edward remained single, that something would occur

<P>to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of

<P>his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible

<P>opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise

<P>to assist the happiness of all.&nbsp; But he was now married;

<P>and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,

<P>which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he should be married soon, before (as
she imagined)

<P>he could be in orders, and consequently before he could

<P>be in possession of the living, surprised her a little

<P>at first.&nbsp; But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,

<P>in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,

<P>should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.

<P>They were married, married in town, and now hastening

<P>down to her uncle's.&nbsp; What had Edward felt on being within

<P>four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant,

<P>on hearing Lucy's message!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would soon, she supposed, be settled at

<P>Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much

<P>conspired to give her an interest; which she wished

<P>to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.

<P>She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw

<P>in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once

<P>a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,

<P>and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--

<P>pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the

<P>favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every

<P>wealthy friend.&nbsp; In Edward--she knew not what she saw,

<P>nor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing

<P>pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor flattered herself that some one of their

<P>connections in London would write to them to announce

<P>the event, and give farther particulars,--but day after

<P>day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.

<P>Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found

<P>fault with every absent friend.&nbsp; They were all thoughtless

<P>or indolent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?"

<P>was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience

<P>of her mind to have something going on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather

<P>expect to see, than to hear from him again.&nbsp; I earnestly

<P>pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised

<P>to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was gaining something, something to look
forward to.

<P>Colonel Brandon must have some information to give.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely had she so determined it, when the
figure

<P>of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.

<P>He stopt at their gate.&nbsp; It was a gentleman, it

<P>was Colonel Brandon himself.&nbsp; Now she could hear more;

<P>and she trembled in expectation of it.&nbsp; But--it was

<P>NOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.

<P>Were it possible, she must say it must be Edward.

<P>She looked again.&nbsp; He had just dismounted;--she could not be

<P>mistaken,--it WAS Edward.&nbsp; She moved away and sat down.

<P>"He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us.&nbsp; I WILL be

<P>calm; I WILL be mistress of myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment she perceived that the others were
likewise

<P>aware of the mistake.&nbsp; She saw her mother and Marianne

<P>change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper

<P>a few sentences to each other.&nbsp; She would have given

<P>the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand

<P>that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear

<P>in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,

<P>and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a syllable passed aloud.&nbsp; They all
waited

<P>in silence for the appearance of their visitor.

<P>His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment

<P>he was in the passage, and in another he was before them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His countenance, as he entered the room, was
not

<P>too happy, even for Elinor.&nbsp; His complexion was white

<P>with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his

<P>reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.

<P>Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,

<P>to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant

<P>in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,

<P>met with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,

<P>and wished him joy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible
reply.

<P>Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the

<P>moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken

<P>hands with him too.&nbsp; But it was then too late, and with a

<P>countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again

<P>and talked of the weather.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had retreated as much as possible

<P>out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret,

<P>understanding some part, but not the whole of the case,

<P>thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore

<P>took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained

<P>a strict silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness

<P>of the season, a very awful pause took place.&nbsp; It was put

<P>an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he

<P>had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.&nbsp; In a hurried manner,

<P>he replied in the affirmative.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing

<P>the sound of her own voice, now said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of
surprise.--

<P>"No, my mother is in town."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I meant," said Elinor, taking up some work
from

<P>the table, "to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dared not look up;--but her mother and
Marianne both

<P>turned their eyes on him.&nbsp; He coloured, seemed perplexed,

<P>looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs.

<P>ROBERT Ferrars."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"--was repeated by Marianne
and her

<P>mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though

<P>Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him

<P>with the same impatient wonder.&nbsp; He rose from his seat,

<P>and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing

<P>what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,

<P>and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting

<P>the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps you do not know--you may not have
heard

<P>that my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to

<P>Miss Lucy Steele."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment

<P>by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over

<P>her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly

<P>know where she was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said he, "they were married last week,

<P>and are now at Dawlish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could sit it no longer.&nbsp; She almost
ran

<P>out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,

<P>burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would

<P>never cease.&nbsp; Edward, who had till then looked any where,

<P>rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--

<P>or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards

<P>he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,

<P>no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,

<P>and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,

<P>and walked out towards the village--leaving the others

<P>in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change

<P>in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity

<P>which they had no means of lessening but by their

<P>own conjectures.
