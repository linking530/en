<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was
earnestly

<P>pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he

<P>were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved

<P>to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at

<P>the height.&nbsp; His spirits, during the last two or three days,

<P>though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew

<P>more and more partial to the house and environs--never

<P>spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time

<P>to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he

<P>should go when he left them--but still, go he must.

<P>Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly

<P>believe it to be gone.&nbsp; He said so repeatedly; other things

<P>he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave

<P>the lie to his actions.&nbsp; He had no pleasure at Norland;

<P>he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,

<P>he must go.&nbsp; He valued their kindness beyond any thing,

<P>and his greatest happiness was in being with them.

<P>Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite

<P>of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint

<P>on his time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this

<P>way of acting to his mother's account; and it was

<P>happy for her that he had a mother whose character

<P>was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general

<P>excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.

<P>Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes

<P>displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,

<P>she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions

<P>with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,

<P>which had been rather more painfully extorted from her,

<P>for Willoughby's service, by her mother.&nbsp; His want of spirits,

<P>of openness, and of consistency, were most usually

<P>attributed to his want of independence, and his better

<P>knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.

<P>The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose

<P>in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,

<P>the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.

<P>The old well-established grievance of duty against will,

<P>parent against child, was the cause of all.&nbsp; She would have

<P>been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,

<P>this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would

<P>be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.

<P>But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort

<P>to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,

<P>to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word

<P>which fell from him while at Barton, and above all

<P>to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore

<P>round his finger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they
were

<P>at breakfast the last morning, "you would be a happier man

<P>if you had any profession to engage your time and give

<P>an interest to your plans and actions.&nbsp; Some inconvenience

<P>to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you

<P>would not be able to give them so much of your time.

<P>But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited

<P>in one particular at least--you would know where to go

<P>when you left them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do assure you," he replied, "that I have
long

<P>thought on this point, as you think now.&nbsp; It has been,

<P>and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune

<P>to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,

<P>no profession to give me employment, or afford me any

<P>thing like independence.&nbsp; But unfortunately my own nicety,

<P>and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,

<P>an idle, helpless being.&nbsp; We never could agree in our

<P>choice of a profession.&nbsp; I always preferred the church,

<P>as I still do.&nbsp; But that was not smart enough for my family.

<P>They recommended the army.&nbsp; That was a great deal

<P>too smart for me.&nbsp; The law was allowed to be genteel

<P>enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,

<P>made a very good appearance in the first circles,

<P>and drove about town in very knowing gigs.&nbsp; But I had

<P>no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse

<P>study of it, which my family approved.&nbsp; As for the navy,

<P>it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the

<P>subject was first started to enter it--and, at length,

<P>as there was no necessity for my having any profession

<P>at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without

<P>a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced

<P>on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,

<P>and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly

<P>bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his

<P>friends to do nothing.&nbsp; I was therefore entered at Oxford

<P>and have been properly idle ever since."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The consequence of which, I suppose, will
be,"

<P>said Mrs. Dashwood, "since leisure has not promoted

<P>your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up

<P>to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades

<P>as Columella's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will be brought up," said he, in a serious
accent,

<P>"to be as unlike myself as is possible.&nbsp; In feeling,

<P>in action, in condition, in every thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate

<P>want of spirits, Edward.&nbsp; You are in a melancholy humour,

<P>and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.

<P>But remember that the pain of parting from friends

<P>will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their

<P>education or state.&nbsp; Know your own happiness.&nbsp; You want

<P>nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,

<P>call it hope.&nbsp; Your mother will secure to you, in time,

<P>that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,

<P>and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to

<P>prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.

<P>How much may not a few months do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think," replied Edward, "that I may defy
many

<P>months to produce any good to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This desponding turn of mind, though it could
not

<P>be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain

<P>to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,

<P>and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's

<P>feelings especially, which required some trouble and time

<P>to subdue.&nbsp; But as it was her determination to subdue it,

<P>and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than

<P>what all her family suffered on his going away, she did

<P>not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,

<P>on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,

<P>by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.&nbsp; Their means

<P>were as different as their objects, and equally suited

<P>to the advancement of each.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon
as he

<P>was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,

<P>neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,

<P>appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the

<P>general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,

<P>she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented

<P>from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters

<P>were spared much solicitude on her account.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse

<P>of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,

<P>than her own had seemed faulty to her.&nbsp; The business

<P>of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong

<P>affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could

<P>have no merit.&nbsp; That her sister's affections WERE calm,

<P>she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;

<P>and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,

<P>by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite

<P>of this mortifying conviction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without shutting herself up from her family,

<P>or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,

<P>or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,

<P>Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough

<P>to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every

<P>possible variety which the different state of her spirits

<P>at different times could produce,--with tenderness,

<P>pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.&nbsp; There were moments

<P>in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother

<P>and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,

<P>conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect

<P>of solitude was produced.&nbsp; Her mind was inevitably

<P>at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;

<P>and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,

<P>must be before her, must force her attention, and engross

<P>her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at
her

<P>drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after

<P>Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.

<P>She happened to be quite alone.&nbsp; The closing of the

<P>little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front

<P>of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw

<P>a large party walking up to the door.&nbsp; Amongst them

<P>were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,

<P>but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were

<P>quite unknown to her.&nbsp; She was sitting near the window,

<P>and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest

<P>of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,

<P>and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the

<P>casement to speak to him, though the space was so short

<P>between the door and the window, as to make it hardly

<P>possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," said he, "we have brought you some
strangers.

<P>How do you like them?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hush! they will hear you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never mind if they do.&nbsp; It is only the
Palmers.

<P>Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.&nbsp; You may see her

<P>if you look this way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple

<P>of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged

<P>to be excused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is Marianne? Has she run away because
we

<P>are come? I see her instrument is open."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is walking, I believe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who
had not

<P>patience enough to wait till the door was opened before

<P>she told HER story.&nbsp; She came hallooing to the window,

<P>"How do you do, my dear?&nbsp; How does Mrs. Dashwood do?

<P>And where are your sisters?&nbsp; What! all alone! you

<P>will be glad of a little company to sit with you.

<P>I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.

<P>Only think of their coming so suddenly!&nbsp; I thought I heard

<P>a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,

<P>but it never entered my head that it could be them.

<P>I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel

<P>Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think

<P>I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come

<P>back again"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the
middle

<P>of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady

<P>Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood

<P>and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they

<P>all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings

<P>continued her story as she walked through the passage

<P>into the parlour, attended by Sir John.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than
Lady

<P>Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.

<P>She was short and plump, had a very pretty face,

<P>and the finest expression of good humour in it that could

<P>possibly be.&nbsp; Her manners were by no means so elegant

<P>as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.

<P>She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,

<P>except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.

<P>Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six

<P>and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than

<P>his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.

<P>He entered the room with a look of self-consequence,

<P>slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,

<P>and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,

<P>took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it

<P>as long as he staid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly
endowed

<P>by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,

<P>was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour

<P>and every thing in it burst forth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well! what a delightful room this is! I never

<P>saw anything so charming!&nbsp; Only think, Mamma, how it

<P>is improved since I was here last! I always thought it

<P>such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)

<P>but you have made it so charming!&nbsp; Only look, sister,

<P>how delightful every thing is! How I should like such

<P>a house for myself!&nbsp; Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not
even raise

<P>his eyes from the newspaper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Palmer does not hear me," said she, laughing;

<P>"he never does sometimes.&nbsp; It is so ridiculous!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood;
she had

<P>never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,

<P>and could not help looking with surprise at them both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as
loud

<P>as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,

<P>the evening before, on seeing their friends, without

<P>ceasing till every thing was told.&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer laughed

<P>heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,

<P>and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it

<P>had been quite an agreeable surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may believe how glad we all were to see
them,"

<P>added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,

<P>and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard

<P>by no one else, though they were seated on different sides

<P>of the room; "but, however, I can't help wishing they had

<P>not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey

<P>of it, for they came all round by London upon account

<P>of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and

<P>pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.

<P>I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,

<P>but she would come with us; she longed so much to see

<P>you all!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not
do her

<P>any harm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She expects to be confined in February,"

<P>continued Mrs. Jennings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton could no longer endure such
a conversation,

<P>and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there

<P>was any news in the paper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, none at all," he replied, and read on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here comes Marianne," cried Sir John.&nbsp;
"Now, Palmer,

<P>you shall see a monstrous pretty girl."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He immediately went into the passage, opened
the front door,

<P>and ushered her in himself.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings asked her,

<P>as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;

<P>and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,

<P>as to show she understood it.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer looked up

<P>on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,

<P>and then returned to his newspaper.&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer's eye

<P>was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.

<P>She got up to examine them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!&nbsp; Well!
how delightful!

<P>Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;

<P>I could look at them for ever." And then sitting down again,

<P>she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer

<P>rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself

<P>and looked at them all around.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love, have you been asleep?" said his wife,
laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made her no answer; and only observed, after
again

<P>examining the room, that it was very low pitched,

<P>and that the ceiling was crooked.&nbsp; He then made his bow,

<P>and departed with the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John had been very urgent with them all
to

<P>spend the next day at the park.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, who did

<P>not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined

<P>at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;

<P>her daughters might do as they pleased.&nbsp; But they had no

<P>curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,

<P>and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.

<P>They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;

<P>the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.

<P>But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should

<P>be sent for them and they must come.&nbsp; Lady Middleton too,

<P>though she did not press their mother, pressed them.

<P>Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all

<P>seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young

<P>ladies were obliged to yield.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should they ask us?" said Marianne, as
soon as they

<P>were gone.&nbsp; "The rent of this cottage is said to be low;

<P>but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine

<P>at the park whenever any one is staying either with them,

<P>or with us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They mean no less to be civil and kind to
us now,"

<P>said Elinor, "by these frequent invitations, than by

<P>those which we received from them a few weeks ago.

<P>The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown

<P>tedious and dull.&nbsp; We must look for the change elsewhere."
