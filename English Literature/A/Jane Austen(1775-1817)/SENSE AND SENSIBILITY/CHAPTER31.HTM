<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a night of more sleep than she had expected,

<P>Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness

<P>of misery in which she had closed her eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to
talk

<P>of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had

<P>gone through the subject again and again; and with the same

<P>steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,

<P>the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on

<P>Marianne's, as before.&nbsp; Sometimes she could believe

<P>Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,

<P>and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility

<P>of acquitting him.&nbsp; At one moment she was absolutely

<P>indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another

<P>she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third

<P>could resist it with energy.&nbsp; In one thing, however,

<P>she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,

<P>where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,

<P>and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.

<P>Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's

<P>entering into her sorrows with any compassion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, no, it cannot be," she cried;

<P>"she cannot feel.&nbsp; Her kindness is not sympathy;

<P>her good-nature is not tenderness.&nbsp; All that she wants

<P>is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had not needed this to be assured of
the injustice

<P>to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,

<P>by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too

<P>great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a

<P>strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.

<P>Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there

<P>be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent

<P>abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither

<P>reasonable nor candid.&nbsp; She expected from other people

<P>the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged

<P>of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions

<P>on herself.&nbsp; Thus a circumstance occurred, while the

<P>sisters were together in their own room after breakfast,

<P>which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower

<P>in her estimation; because, through her own weakness,

<P>it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,

<P>though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse

<P>of the utmost goodwill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a letter in her outstretched hand, and
countenance

<P>gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,

<P>she entered their room, saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, my dear, I bring you something that I
am sure

<P>will do you good."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne heard enough.&nbsp; In one moment
her imagination

<P>placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness

<P>and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,

<P>convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,

<P>rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,

<P>by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.

<P>The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.

<P>The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,

<P>was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment

<P>which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,

<P>she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within

<P>her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,

<P>could have expressed; and now she could reproach her

<P>only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with

<P>passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely

<P>lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,

<P>she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.

<P>But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,

<P>brought little comfort.&nbsp; Willoughby filled every page.

<P>Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying

<P>as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused

<P>by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater

<P>openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness

<P>towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such

<P>a conviction of their future happiness in each other,

<P>that she wept with agony through the whole of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All her impatience to be at home again now
returned;

<P>her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through

<P>the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,

<P>and she was wildly urgent to be gone.&nbsp; Elinor, unable herself

<P>to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be

<P>in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own

<P>except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;

<P>and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait

<P>for that knowledge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual;
for she

<P>could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able

<P>to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing

<P>Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest

<P>of the morning.&nbsp; Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of

<P>the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,

<P>by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying

<P>any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother

<P>an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions

<P>for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room

<P>on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table

<P>where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,

<P>grieving over her for the hardship of such a task,

<P>and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this manner they had continued about a quarter

<P>of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then

<P>bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can this be?" cried Elinor.&nbsp; "So
early too! I

<P>thought we HAD been safe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne moved to the window--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is Colonel Brandon!" said she, with vexation.

<P>"We are never safe from HIM."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from
home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not trust to THAT," retreating to her
own room.

<P>"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no

<P>conscience in his intrusion on that of others."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The event proved her conjecture right, though
it

<P>was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon

<P>DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that

<P>solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw

<P>THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,

<P>and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,

<P>could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street," said
he,

<P>after the first salutation, "and she encouraged me

<P>to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,

<P>because I thought it probable that I might find you alone,

<P>which I was very desirous of doing.&nbsp; My object--my

<P>wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe

<P>it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must

<P>not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,

<P>lasting conviction to your sister's mind.&nbsp; My regard for her,

<P>for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,

<P>by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY

<P>sincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being

<P>useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours

<P>have been spent in convincing myself that I am right,

<P>is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?"

<P>He stopped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand you," said Elinor.&nbsp; "You
have something

<P>to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character

<P>farther.&nbsp; Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship

<P>that can be shewn Marianne.&nbsp; MY gratitude will be insured

<P>immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS

<P>must be gained by it in time.&nbsp; Pray, pray let me hear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted
Barton

<P>last October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go

<P>farther back.&nbsp; You will find me a very awkward narrator,

<P>Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.&nbsp; A short

<P>account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it

<P>SHALL be a short one.&nbsp; On such a subject," sighing heavily,

<P>"can I have little temptation to be diffuse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopt a moment for recollection, and then,

<P>with another sigh, went on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--

<P>(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression

<P>on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton

<P>Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded

<P>to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,

<P>your sister Marianne."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," answered Elinor, "I have NOT forgotten
it."

<P>He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the
partiality

<P>of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance

<P>between them, as well in mind as person.&nbsp; The same warmth

<P>of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.

<P>This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from

<P>her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.

<P>Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years

<P>we were playfellows and friends.&nbsp; I cannot remember the

<P>time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,

<P>as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my

<P>present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me

<P>incapable of having ever felt.&nbsp; Her's, for me, was, I believe,

<P>fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby

<P>and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.

<P>At seventeen she was lost to me for ever.&nbsp; She was

<P>married--married against her inclination to my brother.

<P>Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.

<P>And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the

<P>conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.

<P>My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.

<P>I had hoped that her regard for me would support her

<P>under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at

<P>last the misery of her situation, for she experienced

<P>great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though

<P>she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I

<P>relate!&nbsp; I have never told you how this was brought on.

<P>We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.

<P>The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.

<P>I was banished to the house of a relation far distant,

<P>and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,

<P>till my father's point was gained.&nbsp; I had depended on her

<P>fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--

<P>but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,

<P>a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least

<P>I should not have now to lament it.&nbsp; This however

<P>was not the case.&nbsp; My brother had no regard for her;

<P>his pleasures were not what they ought to have been,

<P>and from the first he treated her unkindly.&nbsp; The consequence

<P>of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced

<P>as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.&nbsp; She resigned

<P>herself at first to all the misery of her situation;

<P>and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those

<P>regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.&nbsp; But can we

<P>wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,

<P>and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for

<P>my father lived only a few months after their marriage,

<P>and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she

<P>should fall?&nbsp; Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I

<P>meant to promote the happiness of both by removing

<P>from her for years, and for that purpose had procured

<P>my exchange.&nbsp; The shock which her marriage had given me,"

<P>he continued, in a voice of great agitation, "was of

<P>trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,

<P>about two years afterwards, of her divorce.&nbsp; It was

<P>THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection

<P>of what I suffered--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could say no more, and rising hastily walked
for a few

<P>minutes about the room.&nbsp; Elinor, affected by his relation,

<P>and still more by his distress, could not speak.&nbsp; He saw

<P>her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,

<P>and kissed it with grateful respect.&nbsp; A few minutes more

<P>of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was nearly three years after this unhappy

<P>period before I returned to England.&nbsp; My first care,

<P>when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;

<P>but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.

<P>I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there

<P>was every reason to fear that she had removed from him

<P>only to sink deeper in a life of sin.&nbsp; Her legal allowance

<P>was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her

<P>comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that

<P>the power of receiving it had been made over some months

<P>before to another person.&nbsp; He imagined, and calmly could he

<P>imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,

<P>had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.

<P>At last, however, and after I had been six months in England,

<P>I DID find her.&nbsp; Regard for a former servant of my own,

<P>who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit

<P>him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;

<P>and there, the same house, under a similar confinement,

<P>was my unfortunate sister.&nbsp; So altered--so faded--worn

<P>down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I

<P>believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me,

<P>to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,

<P>on whom I had once doted.&nbsp; What I endured in so beholding

<P>her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting

<P>to describe it--I have pained you too much already.

<P>That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage

<P>of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was

<P>my greatest comfort.&nbsp; Life could do nothing for her,

<P>beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;

<P>and that was given.&nbsp; I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,

<P>and under proper attendants; I visited her every day

<P>during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her

<P>last moments."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor

<P>spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,

<P>at the fate of his unfortunate friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,"
said he,

<P>"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my

<P>poor disgraced relation.&nbsp; Their fates, their fortunes,

<P>cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet

<P>disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,

<P>or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you

<P>will live to see the other be.&nbsp; But to what does all this

<P>lead?&nbsp; I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.

<P>Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched

<P>for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!

<P>I WILL be more collected--more concise.&nbsp; She left to my care

<P>her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first

<P>guilty connection, who was then about three years old.

<P>She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.

<P>It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly

<P>would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,

<P>by watching over her education myself, had the nature

<P>of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;

<P>and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.

<P>I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my

<P>brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which

<P>left to me the possession of the family property,) she

<P>visited me at Delaford.&nbsp; I called her a distant relation;

<P>but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected

<P>of a much nearer connection with her.&nbsp; It is now three

<P>years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)

<P>that I removed her from school, to place her under the care

<P>of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,

<P>who had the charge of four or five other girls of about

<P>the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason

<P>to be pleased with her situation.&nbsp; But last February,

<P>almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.

<P>I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned

<P>out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of

<P>her young friends, who was attending her father there

<P>for his health.&nbsp; I knew him to be a very good sort of man,

<P>and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,

<P>for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,

<P>she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she

<P>certainly knew all.&nbsp; He, her father, a well-meaning,

<P>but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,

<P>give no information; for he had been generally confined

<P>to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town

<P>and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried

<P>to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,

<P>of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.

<P>In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;

<P>all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.

<P>What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I

<P>suffered too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "could it be--could

<P>Willoughby!"--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first news that reached me of her," he
continued,

<P>"came in a letter from herself, last October.

<P>It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it

<P>on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;

<P>and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,

<P>which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange

<P>to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.

<P>Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his

<P>looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,

<P>that I was called away to the relief of one whom he

<P>had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,

<P>what would it have availed?&nbsp; Would he have been less

<P>gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?&nbsp; No,

<P>he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel

<P>for another would do.&nbsp; He had left the girl whose

<P>youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of

<P>the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,

<P>no friends, ignorant of his address!&nbsp; He had left her,

<P>promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,

<P>nor relieved her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is beyond every thing!" exclaimed Elinor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His character is now before you; expensive,
dissipated,

<P>and worse than both.&nbsp; Knowing all this, as I have now

<P>known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing

<P>your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured

<P>that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt

<P>for all your sakes.&nbsp; When I came to you last week and

<P>found you alone, I came determined to know the truth;

<P>though irresolute what to do when it WAS known.

<P>My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;

<P>but now you will comprehend it.&nbsp; To suffer you all to be

<P>so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?

<P>I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes

<P>I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him.

<P>But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what

<P>were his designs on her.&nbsp; Whatever they may have been,

<P>however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL

<P>turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she

<P>compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers

<P>the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,

<P>and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,

<P>still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented

<P>by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.

<P>Surely this comparison must have its use with her.

<P>She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.&nbsp; They

<P>proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.

<P>On the contrary, every friend must be made still more

<P>her friend by them.&nbsp; Concern for her unhappiness,

<P>and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen

<P>every attachment.&nbsp; Use your own discretion, however,

<P>in communicating to her what I have told you.&nbsp; You must

<P>know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,

<P>and from my heart believed it might be of service,

<P>might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered

<P>myself to trouble you with this account of my family

<P>afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been

<P>intended to raise myself at the expense of others."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful

<P>earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her

<P>expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the

<P>communication of what had passed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been more pained," said she, "by her

<P>endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it

<P>irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction

<P>of his unworthiness can do.&nbsp; Now, though at first she

<P>will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.

<P>Have you," she continued, after a short silence,

<P>"ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have.&nbsp;
One meeting

<P>was unavoidable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him
anxiously,

<P>saying,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? have you met him to--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I could meet him no other way.&nbsp; Eliza
had confessed

<P>to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;

<P>and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight

<P>after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,

<P>I to punish his conduct.&nbsp; We returned unwounded,

<P>and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of
this;

<P>but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such," said Colonel Brandon, after a pause,

<P>"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother

<P>and daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she still in town?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,

<P>for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her

<P>child into the country, and there she remains."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was
probably

<P>dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,

<P>receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,

<P>and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.
