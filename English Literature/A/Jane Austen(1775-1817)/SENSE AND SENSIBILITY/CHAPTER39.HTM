<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more
than

<P>two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone

<P>increased every day.&nbsp; She sighed for the air, the liberty,

<P>the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place

<P>could give her ease, Barton must do it.&nbsp; Elinor was hardly

<P>less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much

<P>less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she

<P>was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,

<P>which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.

<P>She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards

<P>its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes

<P>to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the

<P>eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,

<P>which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks

<P>longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible

<P>than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland

<P>about the end of March, for the Easter holidays;

<P>and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very

<P>warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.&nbsp; This would

<P>not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of

<P>Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real

<P>politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very

<P>great amendment of his manners towards them since her

<P>sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept

<P>it with pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she told Marianne what she had done, however,

<P>her first reply was not very auspicious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cleveland!"--she cried, with great agitation.

<P>"No, I cannot go to Cleveland."--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You forget," said Elinor gently, "that its
situation

<P>is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of..."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go

<P>into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward

<P>to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of
overcoming

<P>such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by

<P>working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure

<P>which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,

<P>whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,

<P>more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,

<P>and perhaps without any greater delay.&nbsp; From Cleveland,

<P>which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to

<P>Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey;

<P>and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend

<P>them down; and as there could be no occasion of their

<P>staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at

<P>home in little more than three weeks' time.&nbsp; As Marianne's

<P>affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph

<P>with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of
her guest,

<P>that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again

<P>from Cleveland.&nbsp; Elinor was grateful for the attention,

<P>but it could not alter her design; and their mother's

<P>concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative

<P>to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--

<P>and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement

<P>of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I
shall

<P>do without the Miss Dashwoods;"--was Mrs. Jennings's

<P>address to him when he first called on her, after their

<P>leaving her was settled--"for they are quite resolved

<P>upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we

<P>shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape

<P>at one another as dull as two cats."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this
vigorous

<P>sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make

<P>that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--

<P>and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think

<P>her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window

<P>to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,

<P>which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed

<P>her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed

<P>with her there for several minutes.&nbsp; The effect of his

<P>discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,

<P>for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even

<P>changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,

<P>to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne

<P>was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing

<P>that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,

<P>and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--

<P>Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval

<P>of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another,

<P>some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,

<P>in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness

<P>of his house.&nbsp; This set the matter beyond a doubt.

<P>She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary

<P>to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.

<P>What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,

<P>but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did

<P>not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings

<P>commended her in her heart for being so honest.

<P>They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her

<P>catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's

<P>performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm

<P>voice,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a
speech,

<P>she was almost ready to cry out, "Lord! what should

<P>hinder it?"--but checking her desire, confined herself

<P>to this silent ejaculation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very strange!--sure he need not wait

<P>to be older."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This delay on the Colonel's side, however,
did not

<P>seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,

<P>for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,

<P>and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard

<P>Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall always think myself very much obliged
to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,

<P>and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,

<P>the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he

<P>immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away

<P>without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old

<P>friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What had really passed between them was to
this effect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard," said he, with great compassion,

<P>"of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered

<P>from his family; for if I understand the matter right,

<P>he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering

<P>in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--

<P>Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor told him that it was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"--he replied,

<P>with great feeling,--"of dividing, or attempting to divide,

<P>two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--

<P>Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what

<P>she may drive her son to.&nbsp; I have seen Mr. Ferrars two

<P>or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased

<P>with him.&nbsp; He is not a young man with whom one can

<P>be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have

<P>seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,

<P>and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.

<P>I understand that he intends to take orders.&nbsp; Will you

<P>be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,

<P>now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post,

<P>is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,

<P>perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,

<P>it may be&nbsp; nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it

<P>were more&nbsp; valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;

<P>the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than

<P>200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable

<P>of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as

<P>to afford him a very comfortable income.&nbsp; Such as it is,

<P>however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,

<P>will be very great.&nbsp; Pray assure him of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's astonishment at this commission could

<P>hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really

<P>making her an offer of his hand.&nbsp; The preferment,

<P>which only two days before she had considered as hopeless

<P>for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--

<P>and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to

<P>bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had

<P>attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor

<P>feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share

<P>in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,

<P>and her gratitude for the particular friendship,

<P>which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,

<P>were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.&nbsp; She thanked him

<P>for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and

<P>disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;

<P>and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,

<P>if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office

<P>to another.&nbsp; But at the same time, she could not help

<P>thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.

<P>It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give

<P>Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,

<P>she would have been very glad to be spared herself;--

<P>but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,

<P>declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being

<P>given through her means, that she would not on any account

<P>make farther opposition.&nbsp; Edward, she believed, was still in town,

<P>and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.

<P>She could undertake therefore to inform him of it,

<P>in the course of the day.&nbsp; After this had been settled,

<P>Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage

<P>in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,

<P>and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the

<P>house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,

<P>as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,

<P>at least as far as regarded its size.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The smallness of the house," said she,

<P>"I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,

<P>for it will be in proportion to their family and income."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By which the Colonel was surprised to find
that SHE

<P>was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain

<P>consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it

<P>possible that Delaford living could supply such an income,

<P>as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--

<P>and he said so.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This little rectory CAN do no more than make
Mr. Ferrars

<P>comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.

<P>I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;

<P>and my interest is hardly more extensive.&nbsp; If, however,

<P>by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve

<P>him farther, I must think very differently of him

<P>from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful

<P>to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.

<P>What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,

<P>since it can advance him so little towards what must

<P>be his principal, his only object of happiness.

<P>His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,

<P>I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood,

<P>so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;

<P>but after this narration of what really passed between

<P>Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window,

<P>the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may

<P>perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,

<P>nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from

<P>an offer of marriage.
