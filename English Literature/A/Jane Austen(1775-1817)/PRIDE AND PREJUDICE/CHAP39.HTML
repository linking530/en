<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>IT was the second week in May in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality,
both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room upstairs. These two girls
had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite
milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.

<P>&nbsp;After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table
set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
``Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?''

<P>&nbsp;``And we mean to treat you all,'' added Lydia; ``but you must
lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.''
Then shewing her purchases: ``Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do
not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make
it up any better.''

<P>&nbsp;And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, ``Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh,
I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are
going in a fortnight.''

<P>&nbsp;``Are they indeed?'' cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

<P>&nbsp;``They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want
papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious
scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would
like to go too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else
we shall have!''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes,'' thought Elizabeth, ``<I>that</I> would be a delightful
scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,
and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by
one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.''

<P>&nbsp;``Now I have got some news for you,'' said Lydia, as they sat
down to table. ``What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news,
and about a certain person that we all like.''

<P>&nbsp;Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told
that he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said, ``Aye, that is just like
your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as
if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going
to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such
a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham;
too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying
Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool;
gone to stay. Wickham is safe.''

<P>&nbsp;``And Mary King is safe!'' added Elizabeth; ``safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.''

<P>&nbsp;``She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.''

<P>&nbsp;``But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,'' said
Jane.

<P>&nbsp;``I am sure there is not on <I>his</I>. I will answer for it he
never cared three straws about her. Who <I>could</I> about such a nasty
little freckled thing?''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of <I>expression</I> herself, the coarseness of the <I>sentiment</I>
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!

<P>&nbsp;As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage
was ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

<P>&nbsp;``How nicely we are crammed in!'' cried Lydia. ``I am glad I bought
my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since
you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting?
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you
came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost
three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before
three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't
think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but <I>I</I> do
not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like
to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to
all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at
Colonel Foster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster
promised to have a little dance in the evening (by the bye, Mrs. Forster
and me are <I>such</I> friends!); and so she asked the two Harringtons
to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself;
and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's
clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, -- only think what fun! Not a soul
knew of it but Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt,
for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how
well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more
of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed!
and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And <I>that</I>
made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the
matter.''

<P>&nbsp;With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

<P>&nbsp;Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to
see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.
Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

<P>&nbsp;``I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.''

<P>&nbsp;Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which
occupied them. Lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria, across the table, after
the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly
engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from
Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all
to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any
other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to
any body who would hear her.

<P>&nbsp;``Oh! Mary,'' said she, ``I wish you had gone with us, for we
had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and
pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all
the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do
think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the
nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would
have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought
we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,
that any body might have heard us ten miles off!''

<P>&nbsp;To this, Mary very gravely replied, ``Far be it from me, my dear
sister, to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial
with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms
for me. I should infinitely prefer a book.''

<P>&nbsp;But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened
to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at
all.

<P>&nbsp;In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to
walk to Meryton, and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham
again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to
<I>her</I> of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.
In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.

<P>&nbsp;She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the
Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
