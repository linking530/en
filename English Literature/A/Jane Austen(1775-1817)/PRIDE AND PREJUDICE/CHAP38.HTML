<BR>ON Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying
the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

<P>&nbsp;``I know not, Miss Elizabeth,'' said he, ``whether Mrs. Collins
has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am
very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks
for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being
with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make <I>her</I>
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity
replied,

<P>&nbsp;``It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed
your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble
home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot
have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's
family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which
few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually
we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages
of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object
of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.''

<P>&nbsp;Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and
he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

<P>&nbsp;``You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate --; but on this point it will
be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There
is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas
between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where
that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have
the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they
sprung. Poor Charlotte! -- it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
-- But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting
that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent
concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

<P>&nbsp;At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the
parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for
the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments
to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria
followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly
reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten
to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

<P>&nbsp;``But,'' he added, ``you will of course wish to have your humble
respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness
to you while you have been here.''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth made no objection; -- the door was then allowed to be
shut, and the carriage drove off.

<P>&nbsp;``Good gracious!'' cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, ``it
seems but a day or two since we first came! -- and yet how many things
have happened!''

<P>&nbsp;``A great many indeed,'' said her companion with a sigh.

<P>&nbsp;``We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice! -- How much I shall have to tell!''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth privately added, ``And how much I shall have to conceal.''

<P>&nbsp;Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any
alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr.
Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.

<P>&nbsp;Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying
her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn
there would be leisure enough for observation.

<P>&nbsp;It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even
for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To
know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister farther.
