<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>ELIZABETH'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. ``How could
you begin?'' said she. ``I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?''

<P>&nbsp;``I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words,
which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before
I knew that I <I>had</I> begun.''

<P>&nbsp;``My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --
my behaviour to <I>you</I> was at least always bordering on the uncivil,
and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?''

<P>&nbsp;``For the liveliness of your mind, I did.''

<P>&nbsp;``You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little
less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for <I>your</I> approbation alone. I roused,
and interested you, because I was so unlike <I>them</I>. Had you not been
really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains
you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just;
and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of <I>that</I>
when they fall in love.''

<P>&nbsp;``Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while
she was ill at Netherfield?''

<P>&nbsp;``Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue
of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you
are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs
to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as
may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?''

<P>&nbsp;``Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.''

<P>&nbsp;``But I was embarrassed.''

<P>&nbsp;``And so was I.''

<P>&nbsp;``You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.''

<P>&nbsp;``A man who had felt less, might.''

<P>&nbsp;``How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,
and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long
you <I>would</I> have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder
when you <I>would</I> have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution
of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
<I>Too</I> <I>much</I>, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if
our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned
the subject. This will never do.''

<P>&nbsp;``You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly
fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the
means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness
to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.''

<P>&nbsp;``Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make
her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down
to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?''

<P>&nbsp;``My real purpose was to see <I>you</I>, and to judge, if I could,
whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I
avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to
Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since
made.''

<P>&nbsp;``Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what
is to befall her?''

<P>&nbsp;``I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.
But it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall
be done directly.''

<P>&nbsp;``And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you
and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.''

<P>&nbsp;From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter; but now, having <I>that</I> to communicate which she knew
would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

<P>&nbsp;``I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to
have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really
existed. But <I>now</I> suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject
will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than
you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the
Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is
delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature
in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with
such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr.
Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. You
are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Your's, &amp;c.''

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;
and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins,
in reply to his last.

<P>&nbsp;``DEAR SIR,

<P>&nbsp;I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.

<P>&nbsp;Your's sincerely, &amp;c.''

<P>&nbsp;Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder
answer than she knew was deserved.

<P>&nbsp;The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

<P>&nbsp;Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses
were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden removal
was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry
by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing
in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At
such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth,
though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure
dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious
civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on
carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes
of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax
on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood
in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she <I>did</I> speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely
to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from
the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself,
and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification;
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the
season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future;
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed
from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance
of their family party at Pemberley.
