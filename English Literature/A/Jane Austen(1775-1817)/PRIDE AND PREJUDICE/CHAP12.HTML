<BR>IN consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote
the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent
for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated
on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive hem
with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least
not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet
sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday;
and in her postscript it was added that, if Mr. Bingley and his sister
pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. -- Against
staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she
much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered
as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's
carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original
design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the
request made.

<P>&nbsp;The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough
was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day, to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

<P>&nbsp;The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were
to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would
not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was
firm where she felt herself to be right.

<P>&nbsp;To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence -- Elizabeth had been
at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked -- and
Miss Bingley was uncivil to <I>her</I>, and more teazing than usual to
himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of
admiration should <I>now</I> escape him, nothing that could elevate her
with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea
had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material
weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely
spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously
to his book, and would not even look at her.

<P>&nbsp;On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable
to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased
at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they
parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give
her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. -- Elizabeth took leave
of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

<P>&nbsp;They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so
much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. -- But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.

<P>&nbsp;They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass
and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had
actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
