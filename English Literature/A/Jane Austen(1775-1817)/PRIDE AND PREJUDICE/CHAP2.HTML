<BR>MR. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly
addressed her with,

<P>&nbsp;``I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.''

<P>&nbsp;``We are not in a way to know <I>what</I> Mr. Bingley likes,''
said her mother resentfully, ``since we are not to visit.''

<P>&nbsp;``But you forget, mama,'' said Elizabeth, ``that we shall meet
him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.''

<P>&nbsp;``I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two
nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no
opinion of her.''

<P>&nbsp;``No more have I,'' said Mr. Bennet; ``and I am glad to find that
you do not depend on her serving you.''

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

<P>&nbsp;``Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.''

<P>&nbsp;``Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,'' said her father; ``she
times them ill.''

<P>&nbsp;``I do not cough for my own amusement,'' replied Kitty fretfully.

<P>&nbsp;``When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?''

<P>&nbsp;``To-morrow fortnight.''

<P>&nbsp;``Aye, so it is,'' cried her mother, ``and Mrs. Long does not
come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce
him, for she will not know him herself.''

<P>&nbsp;``Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
introduce Mr. Bingley to <I>her</I>.''

<P>&nbsp;``Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted
with him myself; how can you be so teazing?''

<P>&nbsp;``I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is
certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end
of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.''

<P>&nbsp;The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, ``Nonsense,
nonsense!''

<P>&nbsp;``What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?'' cried
he. ``Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is
laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <I>there</I>.
What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know,
and read great books, and make extracts.''

<P>&nbsp;Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

<P>&nbsp;``While Mary is adjusting her ideas,'' he continued, ``let us
return to Mr. Bingley.''

<P>&nbsp;``I am sick of Mr. Bingley,'' cried his wife.

<P>&nbsp;``I am sorry to hear <I>that</I>; but why did not you tell me
so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have
called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit,
we cannot escape the acquaintance now.''

<P>&nbsp;The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of
joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all
the while.

<P>&nbsp;``How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect
such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke,
too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about
it till now.''

<P>&nbsp;``Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,'' said Mr. Bennet;
and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

<P>&nbsp;``What an excellent father you have, girls,'' said she, when the
door was shut. ``I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his
kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not
so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you <I>are</I>
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.''

<P>&nbsp;``Oh!'' said Lydia stoutly, ``I am not afraid; for though I <I>am</I>
the youngest, I'm the tallest.''

<P>&nbsp;The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he
would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him
to dinner.
