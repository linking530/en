<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>TWO days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming
towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their mother,
went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they
approached her she said to Miss Bennet, ``I beg your pardon, madam, for
interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news
from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.''

<P>&nbsp;``What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.''

<P>&nbsp;``Dear madam,'' cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, ``don't
you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has
been here this half hour, and master has had a letter.''

<P>&nbsp;Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to
the library; -- their father was in neither; and they were on the point
of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler,
who said,

<P>&nbsp;``If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards
the little copse.''

<P>&nbsp;Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall
once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

<P>&nbsp;Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running,
as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

<P>&nbsp;``Oh, Papa, what news? what news? Have you heard from my uncle?''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.''

<P>&nbsp;``Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?''

<P>&nbsp;``What is there of good to be expected?'' said he, taking the
letter from his pocket; ``but perhaps you would like to read it.'' Elizabeth
impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

<P>&nbsp;``Read it aloud,'' said their father, ``for I hardly know myself
what it is about.''

<P>&nbsp;``Gracechurch-street, Monday, August 2.

<P>&nbsp;MY DEAR BROTHER,

<P>&nbsp;At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left
me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London
they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet. It is enough to know
they are discovered; I have seen them both --''

<P>&nbsp;``Then it is as I always hoped,'' cried Jane; ``they are married!''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth read on:

<P>&nbsp;``I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find
there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform
the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is to assure to
your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds
secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister;
and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering
every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought
myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time
may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from
these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless
as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that
respect; and, I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even
when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to
her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers
to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately
give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There
will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore,
stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back
your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We
have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of
which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again
as soon as any thing more is determined on. Your's, &amp;c.

<P>&nbsp;EDW. GARDINER.''

<P>&nbsp;``Is it possible!'' cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. --
``Can it be possible that he will marry her?''

<P>&nbsp;``Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him!''
said her sister. ``My dear father, I congratulate you.''

<P>&nbsp;``And have you answered the letter?'' said Elizabeth.

<P>&nbsp;``No; but it must be done soon.''

<P>&nbsp;Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before
he wrote.

<P>&nbsp;``Oh! my dear father,'' she cried, ``come back, and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.''

<P>&nbsp;``Let me write for you,'' said Jane, ``if you dislike the trouble
yourself.''

<P>&nbsp;``I dislike it very much,'' he replied; ``but it must be done.''

<P>&nbsp;And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the
house.

<P>&nbsp;``And may I ask -- ?'' said Elizabeth, ``but the terms, I suppose,
must be complied with.''

<P>&nbsp;``Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.''

<P>&nbsp;``And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done.
But there are two things that I want very much to know: -- one is, how
much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how
I am ever to pay him.''

<P>&nbsp;``Money! my uncle!'' cried Jane, ``what do you mean, Sir?''

<P>&nbsp;``I mean that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.''

<P>&nbsp;``That is very true,'' said Elizabeth; ``though it had not occurred
to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man; I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.''

<P>&nbsp;``No,'' said her father, ``Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with
a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so
ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship.''

<P>&nbsp;``Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to
be repaid?''

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,
continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to
the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

<P>&nbsp;``And they are really to be married!'' cried Elizabeth, as soon
as they were by themselves. ``How strange this is! And for <I>this</I>
we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance
of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!
Oh, Lydia!''

<P>&nbsp;``I comfort myself with thinking,'' replied Jane, ``that he certainly
would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?''

<P>&nbsp;``If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,''
said Elizabeth, ``and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we
shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham
has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection
and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude
cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such
goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be
happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!''

<P>&nbsp;``We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,''
said Jane. ``I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.''

<P>&nbsp;``Their conduct has been such,'' replied Elizabeth, ``as neither
you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.''

<P>&nbsp;It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood,
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore,
and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known
to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,

<P>&nbsp;``Just as you please.''

<P>&nbsp;``May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?''

<P>&nbsp;``Take whatever you like, and get away.''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went
up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married,
her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been
fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married
was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled
by any remembrance of her misconduct.

<P>&nbsp;``My dear, dear Lydia!'' she cried: ``This is delightful indeed!
-- She will be married! -- I shall see her again! -- She will be married
at sixteen! -- My good, kind brother! -- I knew how it would be -- I knew
he would manage every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham
too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner
about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia!
-- How merry we shall be together when we meet!''

<P>&nbsp;Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence
of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

<P>&nbsp;``For we must attribute this happy conclusion,'' she added, ``in
a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr. Wickham with money.''

<P>&nbsp;``Well,'' cried her mother, ``it is all very right; who should
do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my
children must have had all his money, you know, and it is the first time
we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am
so happy. In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham!
How well it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I
am in such a flutter that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards;
but the things should be ordered immediately.''

<P>&nbsp;She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,
and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders,
had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would
be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate
as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

<P>&nbsp;``I will go to Meryton,'' said she, ``as soon as I am dressed,
and tell the good, good news to my sister Phillips. And as I come back,
I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all
have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.''

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received
her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

<P>&nbsp;Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that
it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though,
in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared,
only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.
