<BR>AS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

<P>&nbsp;``Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,''
said she, ``did he come at all?''

<P>&nbsp;She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

<P>&nbsp;``He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,
when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither?
If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will
think no more about him.''

<P>&nbsp;Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the
approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed
her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

<P>&nbsp;``Now,'' said she, ``that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes, very indifferent indeed,'' said Elizabeth, laughingly.
``Oh, Jane, take care.''

<P>&nbsp;``My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger
now?''

<P>&nbsp;``I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in
love with you as ever.''

<P>&nbsp;
<HR width=50%>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which
the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit,
had revived.

<P>&nbsp;On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and
the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room,
Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place,
which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to
sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened
to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself
by her.

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley
had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise
turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.

<P>&nbsp;His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed
an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own,
would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence,
she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all
the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful
humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide
them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation
would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She
was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how
seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner
whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what
they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times,
have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was
neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.

<P>&nbsp;She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity
of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy,
the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came,
was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked
forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure
for the evening must depend.

<P>&nbsp;``If he does not come to me, <I>then</I>,'' said she, ``I shall
give him up for ever.''

<P>&nbsp;The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

<P>&nbsp;``The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none
of them; do we?''

<P>&nbsp;Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed
him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!

<P>&nbsp;``A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish
enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who
would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same
woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!''

<P>&nbsp;She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee
cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

<P>&nbsp;``Is your sister at Pemberley still?''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.''

<P>&nbsp;``And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?''

<P>&nbsp;``Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.''

<P>&nbsp;She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some
minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth
again, he walked away.

<P>&nbsp;When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,
the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by
him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to
her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing
to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the
room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen
to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others,
and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

<P>&nbsp;``Well girls,'' said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,
``What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly
well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat
a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases'
last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably
well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And,
my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so
too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said
besides? "Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last." She
did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived --
and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome:
I like them prodigiously.''

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen
enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get
him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a
happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed
at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

<P>&nbsp;``It has been a very agreeable day,'' said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.
``The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I
hope we may often meet again.''

<P>&nbsp;Elizabeth smiled.

<P>&nbsp;``Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies
me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater
sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than
any other man.''

<P>&nbsp;``You are very cruel,'' said her sister, ``you will not let me
smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.''

<P>&nbsp;``How hard it is in some cases to be believed!''

<P>&nbsp;``And how impossible in others!''

<P>&nbsp;``But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than
I acknowledge?''

<P>&nbsp;``That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all
love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.''
