<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>ELIZABETH passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in
the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to
the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note
sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own
judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its
contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two
youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

<P>&nbsp;Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have
been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her, that her illness
was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would
not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home;
neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at
all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's
appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her
into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet
had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

<P>&nbsp;``Indeed I have, Sir,'' was her answer. ``She is a great deal
too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We
must trespass a little longer on your kindness.''

<P>&nbsp;``Removed!'' cried Bingley. ``It must not be thought of. My sister,
I am sure, will not hear of her removal.''

<P>&nbsp;``You may depend upon it, Madam,'' said Miss Bingley, with cold
civility, ``that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while
she remains with us.''

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

<P>&nbsp;``I am sure,'' she added, ``if it was not for such good friends
I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and
suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world --
which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
<I>her</I>. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal
to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though
you have but a short lease.''

<P>&nbsp;``Whatever I do is done in a hurry,'' replied he; ``and therefore
if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.''

<P>&nbsp;``That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,'' said Elizabeth.

<P>&nbsp;``You begin to comprehend me, do you?'' cried he, turning towards
her.

<P>&nbsp;``Oh! yes -- I understand you perfectly.''

<P>&nbsp;``I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
seen through I am afraid is pitiful.''

<P>&nbsp;``That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a
deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as
yours.''

<P>&nbsp;``Lizzy,'' cried her mother, ``remember where you are, and do
not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.''

<P>&nbsp;``I did not know before,'' continued Bingley immediately, ``that
you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes; but intricate characters are the <I>most</I> amusing. They
have at least that advantage.''

<P>&nbsp;``The country,'' said Darcy, ``can in general supply but few subjects
for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society.''

<P>&nbsp;``But people themselves alter so much, that there is something
new to be observed in them for ever.''

<P>&nbsp;``Yes, indeed,'' cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of
mentioning a country neighbourhood. ``I assure you there is quite as much
of <I>that</I> going on in the country as in town.''

<P>&nbsp;Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for
a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained
a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.

<P>&nbsp;``I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country
for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast
deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?''

<P>&nbsp;``When I am in the country,'' he replied, ``I never wish to leave
it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.''

<P>&nbsp;``Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,'' looking at Darcy, ``seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.''

<P>&nbsp;``Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,'' said Elizabeth, blushing for
her mother. ``You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were
not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town,
which you must acknowledge to be true.''

<P>&nbsp;``Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods
larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.''

<P>&nbsp;Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep
his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying
something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte
Lucas had been at Longbourn since <I>her</I> coming away.

<P>&nbsp;``Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable
man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley -- is not he? so much the man of fashion!
so genteel and so easy! -- He has always something to say to every body.
-- <I>That</I> is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter.''

<P>&nbsp;``Did Charlotte dine with you?''

<P>&nbsp;``No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince
pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, <I>I</I> always keep servants that can
do their own work; <I>my</I> daughters are brought up differently. But
every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort
of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that <I>I</I>
think Charlotte so <I>very</I> plain -- but then she is our particular
friend.''

<P>&nbsp;``She seems a very pleasant young woman,'' said Bingley.

<P>&nbsp;``Oh! dear, yes; -- but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas
herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to
boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane -- one does not often see any
body better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother
Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however he did
not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on
her, and very pretty they were.''

<P>&nbsp;``And so ended his affection,'' said Elizabeth impatiently. ``There
has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!''

<P>&nbsp;``I have been used to consider poetry as the <I>food</I> of love,''
said Darcy.

<P>&nbsp;``Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes
what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination,
I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.''

<P>&nbsp;Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane
with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly
civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and
say what the occasion required. She performed her part, indeed, without
much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered
her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself
forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole
visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley
with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball
at Netherfield.

<P>&nbsp;Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection
had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits,
and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers,
to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her,
had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address
Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his
promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world
if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful
to their mother's ear.

<P>&nbsp;``I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement, and
when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please, name the very day
of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.''

<P>&nbsp;Lydia declared herself satisfied. ``Oh! yes -- it would be much
better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain
Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given <I>your</I> ball,''
she added, ``I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.''

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could
not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss
Bingley's witticisms on <I>fine</I> <I>eyes</I>.
