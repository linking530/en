<P>He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,

<P>however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,

<P>his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action

<P>off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,

<P>in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home

<P>for half a year at Monkford.&nbsp; He was, at that time, a remarkably
fine

<P>young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;

<P>and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,

<P>and feeling.&nbsp; Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might
have

<P>been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to
love;

<P>but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.

<P>They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and

<P>deeply in love.&nbsp; It would be difficult to say which had seen

<P>highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:

<P>she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in

<P>having them accepted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.

<P>Troubles soon arose.&nbsp; Sir Walter, on being applied to, without
actually

<P>withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all

<P>the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,

<P>and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.

<P>He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with

<P>more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate
one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,

<P>to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen

<P>in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself

<P>to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances

<P>of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure

<P>even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing
away,

<P>which she grieved to think of!&nbsp; Anne Elliot, so young; known to
so few,

<P>to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;

<P>or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,

<P>youth-killing dependence!&nbsp; It must not be, if by any fair interference

<P>of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother's
love,

<P>and mother's rights, it would be prevented.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth had no fortune.&nbsp; He had been lucky in his profession;

<P>but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.

<P>But he was confident that he should soon be rich:&nbsp; full of life
and ardour,

<P>he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station

<P>that would lead to everything he wanted.&nbsp; He had always been lucky;

<P>he knew he knew he should be so still.&nbsp; Such confidence, powerful

<P>in its own warmth, and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it,

<P>must have been enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.

<P>His sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently

<P>on her.&nbsp; She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.&nbsp; It
only added

<P>a dangerous character to himself.&nbsp; He was brilliant, he was headstrong.

<P>Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to

<P>imprudence a horror.&nbsp; She deprecated the connexion in every light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than

<P>Anne could combat.&nbsp; Young and gentle as she was, it might yet

<P>have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will,

<P>though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;

<P>but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,

<P>with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,

<P>be continually advising her in vain.&nbsp; She was persuaded to believe

<P>the engagement a wrong thing:&nbsp; indiscreet, improper, hardly capable

<P>of success, and not deserving it.&nbsp; But it was not a merely selfish
caution,

<P>under which she acted, in putting an end to it.&nbsp; Had she not

<P>imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,

<P>she could hardly have given him up.&nbsp; The belief of being prudent,

<P>and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,

<P>under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation

<P>was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,

<P>on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself

<P>ill used by so forced a relinquishment.&nbsp; He had left the country

<P>in consequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;

<P>but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.

<P>Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every

<P>enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits

<P>had been their lasting effect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>More than seven years were gone since this little history

<P>of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had

<P>softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,

<P>but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given

<P>in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),

<P>or in any novelty or enlargement of society.&nbsp; No one had ever

<P>come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with

<P>Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.&nbsp; No second attachment,

<P>the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,

<P>at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,

<P>the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society

<P>around them.&nbsp; She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,

<P>to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found

<P>a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had

<P>lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,

<P>whose landed property and general importance were second in that country,

<P>only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance;

<P>and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,

<P>while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two

<P>so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of

<P>her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself.

<P>But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;

<P>and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,

<P>never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety

<P>which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man

<P>of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her

<P>to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,

<P>on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never

<P>alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently

<P>from what she had been made to think at nineteen.&nbsp; She did not
blame

<P>Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;

<P>but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,

<P>to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such

<P>certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.

<P>She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at
home,

<P>and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,

<P>delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman

<P>in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of
it;

<P>and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than

<P>the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,

<P>without reference to the actual results of their case, which,

<P>as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than

<P>could be reasonably calculated on.&nbsp; All his sanguine expectations,

<P>all his confidence had been justified.&nbsp; His genius and ardour

<P>had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.

<P>He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:

<P>and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.

<P>He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,

<P>and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.

<P>She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,

<P>but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,

<P>she had no reason to believe him married.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,

<P>were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful

<P>confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which

<P>seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!&nbsp; She had been
forced

<P>into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:

<P>the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,

<P>she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely

<P>to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,

<P>and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.

<P>She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves

<P>sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts

<P>and their business no evil.&nbsp; She was assisted, however, by that

<P>perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three

<P>of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to
deny

<P>any recollection of it.&nbsp; She could do justice to the superiority

<P>of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;

<P>she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;

<P>but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important

<P>from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really

<P>taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which

<P>had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to

<P>those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,

<P>she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,

<P>the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received

<P>any information of their short-lived engagement.&nbsp; That brother
had been

<P>long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,

<P>a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's

<P>having heard of it from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying

<P>her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,

<P>had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by

<P>the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge

<P>of it afterwards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself

<P>and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,

<P>and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,

<P>need not involve any particular awkwardness.
