<P>The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:&nbsp; the day was
even fixed;

<P>and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,

<P>was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning

<P>to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,

<P>within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,

<P>and there must be intercourse between the two families.

<P>This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his
time

<P>at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather

<P>as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,

<P>she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,

<P>almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,

<P>in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing

<P>Captain Wentworth at the Hall:&nbsp; those rooms had witnessed

<P>former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;

<P>but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and

<P>Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.&nbsp; They did not like each
other,

<P>and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady
Russell

<P>to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,

<P>and she too little.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating

<P>her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed

<P>quite long enough.&nbsp; Her usefulness to little Charles would always

<P>give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there,

<P>but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay
for.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way

<P>which she had not at all imagined.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth, after being
unseen

<P>and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among
them

<P>to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at
last,

<P>had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled

<P>with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,

<P>quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.&nbsp; Captain
Harville

<P>had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received

<P>two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him

<P>had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.&nbsp; He had been there

<P>for four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp; His acquittal was complete,

<P>his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,

<P>and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended
to

<P>by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,

<P>and a project for going thither was the consequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The young people were all wild to see Lyme.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth
talked

<P>of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;

<P>though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,

<P>Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed

<P>the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,

<P>being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,

<P>bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off

<P>till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,

<P>Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at
night;

<P>but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;

<P>and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in

<P>the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,

<P>after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,

<P>for going and returning.&nbsp; They were, consequently, to stay the
night there,

<P>and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.&nbsp; This was
felt

<P>to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great
House

<P>at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,

<P>it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach

<P>containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which

<P>he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,

<P>and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,

<P>that it was very evident they would not have more than time

<P>for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were
gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,

<P>the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly

<P>down to the sea.&nbsp; They were come too late in the year for any amusement

<P>or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.&nbsp; The rooms

<P>were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family

<P>but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire

<P>in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,

<P>the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the
Cobb,

<P>skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,

<P>is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,

<P>its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful

<P>line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what

<P>the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,

<P>who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,

<P>to make him wish to know it better.&nbsp; The scenes in its neighbourhood,

<P>Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,

<P>and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,

<P>where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot

<P>for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;

<P>the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,

<P>Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where

<P>the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,

<P>declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first

<P>partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,

<P>where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may

<P>more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed

<P>Isle of Wight:&nbsp; these places must be visited, and visited again,

<P>to make the worth of Lyme understood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted

<P>and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves

<P>on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze

<P>on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,

<P>proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself

<P>and on Captain Wentworth's account:&nbsp; for in a small house,

<P>near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.

<P>Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked
on,

<P>and he was to join them on the Cobb.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even
Louisa

<P>seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,

<P>when they saw him coming after them, with three companions,

<P>all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,

<P>and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;

<P>and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,

<P>on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as

<P>an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,

<P>which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,

<P>had been followed by a little history of his private life,

<P>which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.

<P>He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now

<P>mourning her loss.&nbsp; They had been a year or two waiting for fortune

<P>and promotion.&nbsp; Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being
great;

<P>promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know
it.

<P>She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.&nbsp; Captain
Wentworth

<P>believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman

<P>than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply

<P>afflicted under the dreadful change.&nbsp; He considered his disposition

<P>as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings

<P>with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,

<P>and sedentary pursuits.&nbsp; To finish the interest of the story,

<P>the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,

<P>augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,

<P>and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.&nbsp; Captain
Harville

<P>had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,

<P>and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,

<P>and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement

<P>of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's

<P>state of mind.&nbsp; The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain
Benwick

<P>was very great.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And yet," said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward

<P>to meet the party, "he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart

<P>than I have.&nbsp; I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.

<P>He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;

<P>younger as a man.&nbsp; He will rally again, and be happy with another."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They all met, and were introduced.&nbsp; Captain Harville was a tall,

<P>dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;

<P>and from strong features and want of health, looking much older

<P>than Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Captain Benwick looked, and was,

<P>the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,

<P>a little man.&nbsp; He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,

<P>just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,

<P>was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.

<P>Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,

<P>to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant

<P>than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their
own,

<P>because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable

<P>than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.

<P>The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,

<P>accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth

<P>should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it

<P>as a thing of course that they should dine with them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,

<P>and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,

<P>so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners

<P>of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be

<P>benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.

<P>"These would have been all my friends," was her thought;

<P>and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,

<P>and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart

<P>could think capable of accommodating so many.&nbsp; Anne had

<P>a moment's astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost

<P>in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all

<P>the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,

<P>to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies

<P>of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors

<P>against the winter storms to be expected.&nbsp; The varieties in

<P>the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries

<P>provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,

<P>were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,

<P>excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable

<P>from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,

<P>were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,

<P>the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,

<P>the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,

<P>made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived

<P>excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,

<P>for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of

<P>Captain Benwick.&nbsp; His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;

<P>but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with

<P>constant employment within.&nbsp; He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,

<P>he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles

<P>and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,

<P>sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they

<P>quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,

<P>burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character

<P>of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,

<P>their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having

<P>more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;

<P>that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be

<P>respected and loved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme

<P>answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being

<P>"so entirely out of season," and the "no thoroughfare of Lyme,"

<P>and the "no expectation of company," had brought many apologies

<P>from the heads of the inn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened

<P>to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined

<P>could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,

<P>and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it

<P>(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,

<P>but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;

<P>and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than

<P>had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick

<P>had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of

<P>so many strangers.&nbsp; He ventured among them again, however,

<P>though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth

<P>of the party in general.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the
room,

<P>and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance

<P>to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed

<P>rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse

<P>of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.

<P>He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of

<P>her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;

<P>and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.

<P>He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,

<P>though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having

<P>given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects,

<P>which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope

<P>of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and

<P>benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown
out

<P>of their conversation.&nbsp; For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;

<P>it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their

<P>usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of

<P>the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion

<P>as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion

<P>or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour

<P>and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,

<P>he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs

<P>of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony

<P>of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various
lines

<P>which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,

<P>and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,

<P>that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,

<P>and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be

<P>seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;

<P>and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly

<P>were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion

<P>to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself

<P>the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend

<P>a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested

<P>to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,

<P>such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters

<P>of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment

<P>as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,

<P>and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for

<P>the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,

<P>and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books

<P>on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,

<P>and promised to procure and read them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea

<P>of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young
man

<P>whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,

<P>on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists

<P>and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct

<P>would ill bear examination.
