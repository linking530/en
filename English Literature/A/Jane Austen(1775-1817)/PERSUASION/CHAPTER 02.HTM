<P>Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold

<P>or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable

<P>prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest
hint,

<P>and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to

<P>the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense

<P>he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as

<P>he meant to see finally adopted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it

<P>much serious consideration.&nbsp; She was a woman rather of sound than
of

<P>quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision

<P>in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.

<P>She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;

<P>but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous

<P>for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what

<P>was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.

<P>She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of

<P>strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions

<P>of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.

<P>She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,

<P>rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;

<P>she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little

<P>to the faults of those who possessed them.&nbsp; Herself the widow of

<P>only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;

<P>and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,

<P>an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her

<P>very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,

<P>as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal

<P>of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.&nbsp; But she was

<P>very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him

<P>and Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,

<P>and she did what nobody else thought of doing:&nbsp; she consulted Anne,

<P>who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest

<P>in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her

<P>in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted

<P>to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of

<P>honesty against importance.&nbsp; She wanted more vigorous measures,

<P>a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,

<P>a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Lady Russell,

<P>looking over her paper, "much may be done.&nbsp; If he will adopt

<P>these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope

<P>we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has

<P>a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;

<P>and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from

<P>lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.

<P>What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families

<P>have done, or ought to do?&nbsp; There will be nothing singular in his
case;

<P>and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,

<P>as it always does of our conduct.&nbsp; I have great hope of prevailing.

<P>We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who

<P>has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to

<P>the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,

<P>there is still more due to the character of an honest man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,

<P>his friends to be urging him.&nbsp; She considered it as an act

<P>of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with

<P>all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments

<P>could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.

<P>She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.&nbsp; She rated

<P>Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree

<P>of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed

<P>there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,

<P>than to half a reformation.&nbsp; Her knowledge of her father

<P>and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair

<P>of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,

<P>through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken

<P>is of little consequence.&nbsp; Lady Russell's had no success at all:

<P>could not be put up with, were not to be borne. "What! every comfort

<P>of life knocked off!&nbsp; Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--

<P>contractions and restrictions every where!&nbsp; To live no longer

<P>with the decencies even of a private gentleman!&nbsp; No, he would sooner

<P>quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quit Kellynch Hall."&nbsp; The hint was immediately taken up by Mr
Shepherd,

<P>whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's retrenching,

<P>and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without

<P>a change of abode.&nbsp; "Since the idea had been started in the very
quarter

<P>which ought to dictate, he had no scruple," he said, "in confessing

<P>his judgement to be entirely on that side.&nbsp; It did not appear to
him

<P>that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house

<P>which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.

<P>In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would

<P>be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way

<P>he might choose to model his household."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more

<P>of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go

<P>was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house

<P>in the country.&nbsp; All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.

<P>A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have

<P>Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure

<P>of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object

<P>of her ambition.&nbsp; But the usual fate of Anne attended her,

<P>in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.

<P>She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;

<P>and Bath was to be her home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt

<P>that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skillful enough

<P>to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.&nbsp; It was a much
safer

<P>place for a gentleman in his predicament:&nbsp; he might there be important

<P>at comparatively little expense.&nbsp; Two material advantages of Bath

<P>over London had of course been given all their weight:&nbsp; its more
convenient

<P>distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending

<P>some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction

<P>of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been

<P>for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that

<P>they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.

<P>It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house

<P>in his own neighbourhood.&nbsp; Anne herself would have found

<P>the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's

<P>feelings they must have been dreadful.&nbsp; And with regard to Anne's

<P>dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,

<P>first, from the circumstance of her having been three years

<P>at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly,

<P>from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter

<P>which she had afterwards spent there with herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think

<P>it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health,

<P>by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,

<P>every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must

<P>do both health and spirits good.&nbsp; Anne had been too little from
home,

<P>too little seen. Her spirits were not high.&nbsp; A larger society

<P>would improve them.&nbsp; She wanted her to be more known.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood

<P>for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,

<P>and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily

<P>engrafted on the beginning.&nbsp; He was not only to quit his home,

<P>but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,

<P>which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.

<P>Kellynch Hall was to be let.&nbsp; This, however, was a profound secret,

<P>not to be breathed beyond their own circle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known

<P>to design letting his house.&nbsp; Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the
word

<P>"advertise," but never dared approach it again.&nbsp; Sir Walter spurned

<P>the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint

<P>being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on

<P>the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most

<P>unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,

<P>that he would let it at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!&nbsp; Lady Russell
had

<P>another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter

<P>and his family were to remove from the country.&nbsp; Elizabeth had
been

<P>lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.

<P>It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,

<P>after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with

<P>the additional burden of two children.&nbsp; She was a clever young
woman,

<P>who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,

<P>at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,

<P>as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all

<P>that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,

<P>could hint of caution and reserve.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,

<P>and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,

<P>than because Elizabeth deserved it.&nbsp; She had never received from
her more

<P>than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;

<P>had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,

<P>against previous inclination.&nbsp; She had been repeatedly very earnest

<P>in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open

<P>to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements

<P>which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured

<P>to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;

<P>but always in vain:&nbsp; Elizabeth would go her own way; and never
had she

<P>pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in

<P>this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving

<P>a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought

<P>to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal,

<P>and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;

<P>and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice

<P>of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore

<P>an object of first-rate importance.
