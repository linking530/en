<P>While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing

<P>his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth

<P>was already on his way thither.&nbsp; Before Mrs Croft had written,

<P>he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.&nbsp; They were

<P>in Milsom Street.&nbsp; It began to rain, not much, but enough to

<P>make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it

<P>very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being

<P>conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting

<P>at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,

<P>turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,

<P>to request her assistance.&nbsp; He soon joined them again, successful,

<P>of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,

<P>and would call for them in a few minutes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold

<P>more than four with any comfort.&nbsp; Miss Carteret was with her mother;

<P>consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation

<P>for all the three Camden Place ladies.&nbsp; There could be no doubt

<P>as to Miss Elliot.&nbsp; Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer
none,

<P>but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility

<P>between the other two.&nbsp; The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was

<P>most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.&nbsp; But the rain
was also

<P>a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at
all,

<P>and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne's;

<P>and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left

<P>to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between
them

<P>with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were

<P>obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay

<P>had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,

<P>that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the thickest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party

<P>in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,

<P>as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,

<P>Captain Wentworth walking down the street.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that

<P>she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable

<P>and absurd!&nbsp; For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;

<P>it was all confusion.&nbsp; She was lost, and when she had scolded

<P>back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,

<P>and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street

<P>on a commission of Mrs Clay's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;

<P>she wanted to see if it rained.&nbsp; Why was she to suspect herself

<P>of another motive?&nbsp; Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.

<P>She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always

<P>so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other

<P>of being worse than it was.&nbsp; She would see if it rained.

<P>She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of

<P>Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,

<P>evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined

<P>a little below Milsom Street.&nbsp; He was more obviously struck

<P>and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;

<P>he looked quite red.&nbsp; For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,

<P>she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.

<P>She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.

<P>All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects

<P>of strong surprise were over with her.&nbsp; Still, however,

<P>she had enough to feel!&nbsp; It was agitation, pain, pleasure,

<P>a something between delight and misery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He spoke to her, and then turned away.&nbsp; The character of his manner

<P>was embarrassment.&nbsp; She could not have called it either cold or
friendly,

<P>or anything so certainly as embarrassed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.

<P>Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:&nbsp; neither of them, probably,

<P>much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible

<P>of his being less at ease than formerly.&nbsp; They had by dint of being

<P>so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable

<P>portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it
now.

<P>Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.&nbsp; There was consciousness

<P>of some sort or other.&nbsp; He looked very well, not as if he had been

<P>suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,

<P>of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look

<P>of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was

<P>Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that
he was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth

<P>would not know him.&nbsp; She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth
saw him,

<P>that there was complete internal recognition on each side;

<P>she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,

<P>expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away

<P>with unalterable coldness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing

<P>very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.

<P>It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,

<P>and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd

<P>in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey

<P>Miss Elliot.&nbsp; At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but

<P>by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;

<P>and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,

<P>and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am much obliged to you," was her answer, "but I am not going with
them.

<P>The carriage would not accommodate so many.&nbsp; I walk:&nbsp; I prefer
walking."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But it rains."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! very little,&nbsp; Nothing that I regard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a moment's pause he said:&nbsp; "Though I came only yesterday,

<P>I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,"

<P>(pointing to a new umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it,

<P>if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent

<P>to let me get you a chair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating

<P>her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,

<P>and adding, "I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.&nbsp; He will be here
in a moment,

<P>I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.

<P>Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.&nbsp; There was no difference

<P>between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,

<P>admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner

<P>of the privileged relation and friend.&nbsp; He came in with eagerness,

<P>appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,

<P>was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away

<P>without further loss of time and before the rain increased;

<P>and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,

<P>a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a "Good morning to you!"

<P>being all that she had time for, as she passed away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's
party

<P>began talking of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, that is clear enough.&nbsp; One can guess what will happen
there.

<P>He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.

<P>What a very good-looking man!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,

<P>says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes

<P>to look at her.&nbsp; It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess

<P>I admire her more than her sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! so do I."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so do I.&nbsp; No comparison.&nbsp; But the men are all wild after
Miss Elliot.

<P>Anne is too delicate for them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would
have

<P>walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.

<P>She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing

<P>could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects

<P>were principally such as were wont to be always interesting:

<P>praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,

<P>and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.&nbsp; But just now

<P>she could think only of Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; She could not understand

<P>his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much

<P>from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,

<P>she could not be quite herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!

<P>she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long

<P>he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not

<P>recollect it.&nbsp; He might be only passing through.&nbsp; But it was
more probable

<P>that he should be come to stay.&nbsp; In that case, so liable as every
body was

<P>to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood

<P>see him somewhere.&nbsp; Would she recollect him?&nbsp; How would it
all be?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove

<P>was to marry Captain Benwick.&nbsp; It had cost her something to encounter

<P>Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance

<P>to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge

<P>of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first
hour,

<P>in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,

<P>in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him

<P>on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view

<P>the greater part of the street.&nbsp; There were many other men about
him,

<P>many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.

<P>She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea

<P>of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.&nbsp; No, it was

<P>not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they

<P>were nearly opposite.&nbsp; She looked at her however, from time to
time,

<P>anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,

<P>though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew

<P>was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of

<P>Lady Russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--

<P>of her being, in short, intently observing him.&nbsp; She could thoroughly

<P>comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's
mind,

<P>the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment

<P>she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over
him,

<P>and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him

<P>of one personal grace!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.&nbsp; "Now, how would she

<P>speak of him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will wonder," said she, "what has been fixing my eye so long;

<P>but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and

<P>Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.&nbsp; They described

<P>the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this

<P>side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest

<P>and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,

<P>and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess

<P>I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,

<P>either at her friend or herself.&nbsp; The part which provoked her most,

<P>was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have

<P>lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A day or two passed without producing anything.&nbsp; The theatre or
the rooms,

<P>where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough

<P>for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the

<P>elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting

<P>more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,

<P>sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because

<P>her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.

<P>It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.

<P>Of course they must attend.&nbsp; It was really expected to be a good
one,

<P>and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.&nbsp; If she could only
have

<P>a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should

<P>be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over

<P>courage if the opportunity occurred.&nbsp; Elizabeth had turned from
him,

<P>Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened

<P>by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;

<P>but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,

<P>with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.

<P>Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By all means," said she; "only tell me all about it, when you do come.

<P>Who is your party?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne named them all.&nbsp; Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was

<P>leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,

<P>"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me

<P>to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding

<P>that I may not have many more visits from you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense,

<P>was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.
