<P>Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.&nbsp; In one point,

<P>her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.

<P>There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.&nbsp; He stood
as

<P>opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;

<P>and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief

<P>he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.

<P>Pity for him was all over.&nbsp; But this was the only point of relief.

<P>In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,

<P>she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.&nbsp; She was concerned

<P>for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;

<P>for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,

<P>and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing

<P>how to avert any one of them.&nbsp; She was most thankful for her own

<P>knowledge of him.&nbsp; She had never considered herself as entitled
to reward

<P>for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was

<P>a reward indeed springing from it!&nbsp; Mrs Smith had been able to
tell her

<P>what no one else could have done.&nbsp; Could the knowledge have

<P>been extended through her family?&nbsp; But this was a vain idea.

<P>She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,

<P>and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure

<P>as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be

<P>in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;

<P>in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,

<P>escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them

<P>a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,

<P>and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had not the smallest intention of asking him," said Elizabeth,

<P>with affected carelessness, "but he gave so many hints;

<P>so Mrs Clay says, at least."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, I do say it.&nbsp; I never saw anybody in my life spell harder

<P>for an invitation.&nbsp; Poor man!&nbsp; I was really in pain for him;

<P>for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I have been rather too much used to the game

<P>to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.&nbsp; However, when I found

<P>how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father

<P>this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit

<P>an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.&nbsp; They appear
to

<P>so much advantage in company with each other.&nbsp; Each behaving so
pleasantly.

<P>Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite delightful!" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,

<P>to turn her eyes towards Anne.&nbsp; "Exactly like father and son!

<P>Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.&nbsp; If you will have such

<P>ideas!&nbsp; But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions

<P>being beyond those of other men."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Miss Elliot!" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,

<P>and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.

<P>I did invite him, you know.&nbsp; I sent him away with smiles.

<P>When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park

<P>for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew

<P>such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival

<P>of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with

<P>her prime object.&nbsp; It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate

<P>the sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,

<P>placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license

<P>of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have

<P>done otherwise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;

<P>and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.

<P>She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,

<P>but now she saw insincerity in everything.&nbsp; His attentive deference

<P>to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;

<P>and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,

<P>she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,

<P>or the sound of his artificial good sentiments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke

<P>a remonstrance on his side.&nbsp; It was a great object to her to escape

<P>all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool

<P>to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,

<P>as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had

<P>been gradually led along.&nbsp; She was accordingly more guarded,

<P>and more cool, than she had been the night before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where

<P>he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much

<P>to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:

<P>he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary

<P>to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was

<P>not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard

<P>among the too-commanding claims of the others.&nbsp; He little surmised

<P>that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,

<P>bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct

<P>which were least excusable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of
Bath

<P>the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater
part

<P>of two days.&nbsp; He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening
of

<P>his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.

<P>It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;

<P>but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,

<P>seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.

<P>It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practiced

<P>on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources

<P>of mortification preparing for them!&nbsp; Mrs Clay's selfishness was

<P>not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded

<P>for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's

<P>subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,

<P>and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone

<P>directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out

<P>on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which

<P>determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.

<P>She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk

<P>of spending the morning in Rivers Street.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well," said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send but my love.

<P>Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,

<P>and pretend I have read it through.&nbsp; I really cannot be plaguing
myself

<P>for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.

<P>Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.

<P>You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other
night.

<P>I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her

<P>at the concert.&nbsp; Something so formal and arrange in her air!

<P>and she sits so upright!&nbsp; My best love, of course."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And mine," added Sir Walter.&nbsp; "Kindest regards.&nbsp; And you
may say,

<P>that I mean to call upon her soon.&nbsp; Make a civil message;

<P>but I shall only leave my card.&nbsp; Morning visits are never fair

<P>by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.

<P>If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;

<P>but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; Who could
it be?

<P>Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,

<P>would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.

<P>After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were
heard,

<P>and "Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove" were ushered into the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;

<P>but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry

<P>but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon

<P>as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived

<P>with an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth

<P>were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.

<P>They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were

<P>at the White Hart.&nbsp; So much was pretty soon understood;

<P>but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into

<P>the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,

<P>Anne could not draw upon Charles's brain for a regular history

<P>of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints

<P>of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,

<P>as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted
of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,

<P>and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.&nbsp; He gave her a very
plain,

<P>intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw

<P>a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.&nbsp; The scheme

<P>had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to

<P>come to Bath on business.&nbsp; He had begun to talk of it a week ago;

<P>and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed

<P>coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it

<P>very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear

<P>to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day
or two

<P>everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.&nbsp; But then,

<P>it had been taken up by his father and mother.&nbsp; His mother had

<P>some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought

<P>a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes

<P>for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being

<P>his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy

<P>to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it

<P>by way of general convenience.&nbsp; They had arrived late the night
before.

<P>Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with

<P>Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough

<P>for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.&nbsp; She had imagined

<P>such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent

<P>the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,

<P>very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter

<P>had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth

<P>who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that

<P>on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty

<P>of something more permanent long before the term in question,

<P>the two families had consented to the young people's wishes,

<P>and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,

<P>quite as soon as Louisa's.&nbsp; "And a very good living it was,"

<P>Charles added:&nbsp; "only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,

<P>and in a very fine country:&nbsp;&nbsp; fine part of Dorsetshire.

<P>In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,

<P>surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous

<P>than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might
get

<P>a special recommendation.&nbsp; Not that he will value it as he ought,"

<P>he observed, "Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of
him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am extremely glad, indeed," cried Anne, "particularly glad

<P>that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve

<P>equally well, and who have always been such good friends,

<P>the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--

<P>that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.

<P>I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes.&nbsp; My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were
richer,

<P>but he has no other fault to find.&nbsp; Money, you know, coming down
with

<P>money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,

<P>and it streightens him as to many things.&nbsp; However, I do not mean
to say

<P>they have not a right to it.&nbsp; It is very fit they should have

<P>daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,

<P>liberal father to me.&nbsp; Mary does not above half like Henrietta's
match.

<P>She never did, you know.&nbsp; But she does not do him justice,

<P>nor think enough about Winthrop.&nbsp; I cannot make her attend to

<P>the value of the property.&nbsp; It is a very fair match, as times go;

<P>and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off
now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove," exclaimed Anne,

<P>"should be happy in their children's marriages.&nbsp; They do everything

<P>to confer happiness, I am sure.&nbsp; What a blessing to young people

<P>to be in such hands!&nbsp; Your father and mother seem so totally free

<P>from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct

<P>and misery, both in young and old.&nbsp; I hope you think Louisa

<P>perfectly recovered now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He answered rather hesitatingly, "Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;

<P>but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing

<P>or dancing; it is quite different.&nbsp; If one happens only to shut
the door

<P>a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the
water;

<P>and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,

<P>all day long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could not help laughing.&nbsp; "That cannot be much to your taste,

<P>I know," said she; "but I do believe him to be an excellent young man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure he is.&nbsp; Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think

<P>I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and

<P>pleasures as myself.&nbsp; I have a great value for Benwick; and when
one can

<P>but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.&nbsp; His reading has done
him

<P>no harm, for he has fought as well as read.&nbsp; He is a brave fellow.

<P>I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.

<P>We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in

<P>my father's great barns; and he played his part so well

<P>that I have liked him the better ever since."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's

<P>following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had

<P>heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,

<P>and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,

<P>her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.&nbsp; She would certainly

<P>have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want

<P>to lessen theirs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.&nbsp; Mary was

<P>in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,

<P>and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage

<P>with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,

<P>that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,

<P>and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,

<P>as they were detailed to her.&nbsp; She had no demands on her father
or sister,

<P>and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome

<P>drawing-rooms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.

<P>She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked

<P>to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of
style,

<P>the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by
those

<P>who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.

<P>It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,

<P>and then Elizabeth was happy again.&nbsp; These were her internal persuasions:

<P>"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess

<P>to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;

<P>did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:

<P>and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;

<P>put her quite out of her way.&nbsp; I am sure she would rather not come;

<P>she cannot feel easy with us.&nbsp; I will ask them all for an evening;

<P>that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.

<P>They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.&nbsp; They will be
delighted

<P>to come to-morrow evening.&nbsp; It shall be a regular party, small,

<P>but most elegant."&nbsp; And this satisfied Elizabeth:&nbsp; and when
the invitation

<P>was given to the two present, and promised for the absent,

<P>Mary was as completely satisfied.&nbsp; She was particularly asked

<P>to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,

<P>who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not

<P>have received a more gratifying attention.&nbsp; Miss Elliot was to
have

<P>the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;

<P>and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her

<P>and Henrietta directly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.

<P>They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;

<P>but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication

<P>could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,

<P>to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,

<P>with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to
form.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,

<P>and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.&nbsp; Henrietta was exactly

<P>in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,

<P>which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had

<P>ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been
won

<P>by her usefulness when they were in distress.&nbsp; It was a heartiness,

<P>and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,

<P>from the sad want of such blessings at home.&nbsp; She was entreated

<P>to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day

<P>and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,

<P>she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,

<P>and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's

<P>history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions

<P>on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help

<P>which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;

<P>from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying

<P>to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,

<P>well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window

<P>overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have

<P>her moments of imagining.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.&nbsp; A large party

<P>in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.&nbsp; One five
minutes

<P>brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there

<P>half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,

<P>seemed more than half filled:&nbsp; a party of steady old friends

<P>were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with

<P>Captains Harville and Wentworth.&nbsp; The appearance of the latter

<P>could not be more than the surprise of the moment.&nbsp; It was impossible

<P>for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their

<P>common friends must be soon bringing them together again.

<P>Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;

<P>she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared

<P>from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had

<P>hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.

<P>He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,

<P>and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--

<P>"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts

<P>must understand each other ere long.&nbsp; We are not boy and girl,

<P>to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence,

<P>and wantonly playing with our own happiness."&nbsp; And yet,

<P>a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company

<P>with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be

<P>exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most

<P>mischievous kind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anne," cried Mary, still at her window, "there is Mrs Clay,

<P>I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.

<P>I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.&nbsp; They seemed

<P>deep in talk.&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; Come, and tell me.&nbsp; Good heavens!
I recollect.

<P>It is Mr Elliot himself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," cried Anne, quickly, "it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.

<P>He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back

<P>till to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,

<P>the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret

<P>that she had said so much, simple as it was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,

<P>began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting

<P>still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne

<P>to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,

<P>and tried to be cool and unconcerned.&nbsp; Her distress returned,

<P>however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between

<P>two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves

<P>quite in the secret.&nbsp; It was evident that the report concerning
her

<P>had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure

<P>that it would now spread farther.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do come, Anne" cried Mary, "come and look yourself.&nbsp; You will
be too late

<P>if you do not make haste.&nbsp; They are parting; they are shaking hands.

<P>He is turning away.&nbsp; Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!&nbsp; You seem
to have

<P>forgot all about Lyme."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,

<P>Anne did move quietly to the window.&nbsp; She was just in time to ascertain

<P>that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,

<P>before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off

<P>on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel

<P>at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons

<P>of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, "Yes, it is Mr Elliot,

<P>certainly.&nbsp; He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is
all,

<P>or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;" and walked back to her chair,

<P>recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself
well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them
off,

<P>and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.

<P>I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.

<P>A'n't I a good boy?&nbsp; I know you love a play; and there is room
for us all.

<P>It holds nine.&nbsp; I have engaged Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Anne will

<P>not be sorry to join us, I am sure.&nbsp; We all like a play.

<P>Have not I done well, mother?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness

<P>for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary

<P>eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?

<P>Take a box for to-morrow night!&nbsp; Have you forgot that we are engaged

<P>to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly
asked

<P>to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all

<P>the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?

<P>How can you be so forgetful?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Phoo! phoo!" replied Charles, "what's an evening party?

<P>Never worth remembering.&nbsp; Your father might have asked us to dinner,

<P>I think, if he had wanted to see us.&nbsp; You may do as you like,

<P>but I shall go to the play."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,

<P>when you promised to go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I did not promise.&nbsp; I only smirked and bowed, and said the
word

<P>`happy.'&nbsp; There was no promise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you must go, Charles.&nbsp; It would be unpardonable to fail.

<P>We were asked on purpose to be introduced.&nbsp; There was always

<P>such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.

<P>Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.

<P>We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,

<P>whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!&nbsp; Every attention

<P>is due to Mr Elliot.&nbsp; Consider, my father's heir:&nbsp; the future

<P>representative of the family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried Charles.

<P>"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow

<P>to the rising sun.&nbsp; If I would not go for the sake of your father,

<P>I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.

<P>What is Mr Elliot to me?"&nbsp; The careless expression was life to
Anne,

<P>who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and

<P>listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought

<P>his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious

<P>and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,

<P>invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting

<P>to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,

<P>she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play

<P>without her.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove interposed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had better put it off.&nbsp; Charles, you had much better go back

<P>and change the box for Tuesday.&nbsp; It would be a pity to be divided,

<P>and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;

<P>and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,

<P>if Miss Anne could not be with us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much

<P>so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home

<P>(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.

<P>I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy

<P>to change it for a play, and with you.&nbsp; But, it had better

<P>not be attempted, perhaps."&nbsp; She had spoken it; but she trembled

<P>when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,

<P>and daring not even to try to observe their effect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;

<P>Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,

<P>by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else
would.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;

<P>probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,

<P>and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have not been long enough in Bath," said he, "to enjoy

<P>the evening parties of the place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no.&nbsp; The usual character of them has nothing for me.

<P>I am no card-player."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were not formerly, I know.&nbsp; You did not use to like cards;

<P>but time makes many changes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not yet so much changed," cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she

<P>hardly knew what misconstruction.&nbsp; After waiting a few moments

<P>he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,

<P>"It is a period, indeed!&nbsp; Eight years and a half is a period."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination

<P>to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds

<P>he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,

<P>eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,

<P>and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else

<P>should come in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were obliged to move.&nbsp; Anne talked of being perfectly ready,

<P>and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known

<P>the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,

<P>in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own

<P>sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,

<P>wherewith to pity her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their preparations, however, were stopped short.&nbsp; Alarming sounds

<P>were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open

<P>for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give

<P>a general chill.&nbsp; Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever
she looked

<P>saw symptoms of the same.&nbsp; The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety

<P>of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,

<P>or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.

<P>How mortifying to feel that it was so!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth

<P>was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.

<P>She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.

<P>Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.&nbsp; The sequel

<P>explained it.&nbsp; After the waste of a few minutes in saying

<P>the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which

<P>was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.

<P>"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:&nbsp; no formal party."

<P>It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had

<P>provided herself, the "Miss Elliot at home," were laid on the table,

<P>with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and

<P>one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; The truth was,

<P>that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand

<P>the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.

<P>The past was nothing.&nbsp; The present was that Captain Wentworth

<P>would move about well in her drawing-room.&nbsp; The card was pointedly
given,

<P>and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation

<P>returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,

<P>but not to Anne.&nbsp; She could think only of the invitation she had

<P>with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which

<P>it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather

<P>than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.

<P>She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe

<P>that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement

<P>for all the insolence of the past.&nbsp; Her spirits sank.&nbsp; He
held the card

<P>in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!" whispered Mary

<P>very audibly.&nbsp; "I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!

<P>You see he cannot put the card out of his hand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself

<P>into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,

<P>that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The party separated.&nbsp; The gentlemen had their own pursuits,

<P>the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while

<P>Anne belonged to them.&nbsp; She was earnestly begged to return and
dine,

<P>and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been

<P>so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,

<P>and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent

<P>as she chose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,

<P>she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden
Place,

<P>there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements

<P>of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration

<P>of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all

<P>the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant

<P>of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending

<P>question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?&nbsp; They
were

<P>reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude

<P>never appeased for five minutes together.&nbsp; She generally thought

<P>he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a
case

<P>which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,

<P>as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,

<P>to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot

<P>three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,

<P>for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview

<P>from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to
her

<P>there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened.&nbsp; It was transient:

<P>cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there

<P>the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,

<P>or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend

<P>(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs

<P>on Sir Walter.&nbsp; She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable

<P>imitation of nature: --
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! dear! very true.&nbsp; Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise

<P>I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.&nbsp; I was never more astonished.

<P>He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.&nbsp; He had been
prevented

<P>setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;

<P>for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer

<P>for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.

<P>He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.

<P>He was full of `to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been

<P>full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension

<P>of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never
have

<P>gone so entirely out of my head."
