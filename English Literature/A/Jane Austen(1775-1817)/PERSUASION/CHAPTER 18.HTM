<P>It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,

<P>was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.

<P>She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.

<P>It was three weeks since she had heard at all.&nbsp; She only knew

<P>that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered
to be

<P>recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all

<P>very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary

<P>was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,

<P>with Admiral and Mrs Croft's compliments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crofts must be in Bath!&nbsp; A circumstance to interest her.

<P>They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is this?" cried Sir Walter.&nbsp; "The Crofts have arrived in
Bath?

<P>The Crofts who rent Kellynch?&nbsp; What have they brought you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.&nbsp; They secure an introduction.

<P>I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.

<P>I know what is due to my tenant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how

<P>the poor Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.

<P>It had been begun several days back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "February 1st.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know

<P>how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.

<P>You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,

<P>as you well know, affords little to write about.&nbsp; We have had

<P>a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party

<P>all the holidays.&nbsp; I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.

<P>The holidays, however, are over at last:&nbsp; I believe no children
ever had

<P>such long ones.&nbsp; I am sure I had not.&nbsp; The house was cleared
yesterday,

<P>except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear

<P>they have never gone home.&nbsp; Mrs Harville must be an odd mother

<P>to part with them so long.&nbsp; I do not understand it.&nbsp; They
are

<P>not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to

<P>like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.

<P>What dreadful weather we have had!&nbsp; It may not be felt in Bath,

<P>with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.

<P>I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,

<P>except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.

<P>Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain
at Lyme

<P>as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.

<P>The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.

<P>We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,

<P>Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,

<P>which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of
her;

<P>and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.

<P>I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted

<P>with him too; but I have my usual luck:&nbsp; I am always out of the
way

<P>when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family

<P>to be noticed.&nbsp; What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying

<P>with Elizabeth!&nbsp; Does she never mean to go away?&nbsp; But perhaps

<P>if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.

<P>Let me know what you think of this.&nbsp; I do not expect my children

<P>to be asked, you know.&nbsp; I can leave them at the Great House very
well,

<P>for a month or six weeks.&nbsp; I have this moment heard that the Crofts

<P>are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.

<P>Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility

<P>to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.

<P>I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.&nbsp; We see nothing
of them,

<P>and this is really an instance of gross inattention.&nbsp; Charles joins
me

<P>in love, and everything proper.&nbsp; Yours affectionately,

<P>&nbsp;"Mary M---.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has

<P>just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat

<P>very much about.&nbsp; I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,

<P>you know, are always worse than anybody's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,

<P>containing nearly as much more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa

<P>bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great
deal

<P>to add.&nbsp; In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,

<P>offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,

<P>addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to

<P>make my letter as long as I like.&nbsp; The Admiral does not seem very
ill,

<P>and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.

<P>I shall be truly glad to have them back again.&nbsp; Our neighbourhood

<P>cannot spare such a pleasant family.&nbsp; But now for Louisa.

<P>I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.

<P>She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening

<P>we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised

<P>not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited

<P>as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?

<P>Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,

<P>and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer

<P>from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her

<P>before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.

<P>True, upon my honour!&nbsp; Are not you astonished?&nbsp; I shall be
surprised

<P>at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.

<P>Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.

<P>We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to
her

<P>marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;

<P>and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick

<P>is expected to-day.&nbsp; Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good
deal

<P>on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite

<P>with both.&nbsp; Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love
her

<P>the better for having nursed her.&nbsp; Charles wonders what Captain
Wentworth

<P>will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;

<P>I never could see anything of it.&nbsp; And this is the end, you see,

<P>of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.

<P>How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always

<P>incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; I hope he will be more agreeable now.

<P>Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times
better

<P>than marrying among the Hayters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared

<P>for the news.&nbsp; She had never in her life been more astonished.

<P>Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!&nbsp; It was almost too wonderful

<P>for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain

<P>in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions

<P>of the moment.&nbsp; Happily for her, they were not many.&nbsp; Sir
Walter

<P>wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,

<P>and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath

<P>as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had

<P>little curiosity beyond.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is Mary?" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,

<P>"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They come on the Admiral's account.&nbsp; He is thought to be gouty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gout and decrepitude!" said Sir Walter.&nbsp; "Poor old gentleman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have they any acquaintance here?" asked Elizabeth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's

<P>time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance

<P>in such a place as this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suspect," said Sir Walter coolly, "that Admiral Croft

<P>will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.

<P>Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, no! I think not.&nbsp; Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple,
cousins,

<P>we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance

<P>she might not approve.&nbsp; If we were not related, it would not signify;

<P>but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.

<P>We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.

<P>There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,

<P>I am told, are sailors.&nbsp; The Crofts will associate with them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;

<P>when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,

<P>in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,

<P>Anne was at liberty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.&nbsp; Well might Charles
wonder

<P>how Captain Wentworth would feel!&nbsp; Perhaps he had quitted the field,

<P>had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.

<P>She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything

<P>akin to ill usage between him and his friend.&nbsp; She could not endure

<P>that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!&nbsp; The high-spirited,

<P>joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,

<P>feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything

<P>that would not suit the other.&nbsp; Their minds most dissimilar!

<P>Where could have been the attraction?&nbsp; The answer soon presented
itself.

<P>It had been in situation.&nbsp; They had been thrown together several
weeks;

<P>they had been living in the same small family party:&nbsp; since Henrietta's

<P>coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,

<P>and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting
state,

<P>and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.&nbsp; That was a point which
Anne

<P>had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing

<P>the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,

<P>they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some

<P>dawning of tenderness toward herself.&nbsp; She did not mean, however,

<P>to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary

<P>might have allowed.&nbsp; She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing

<P>young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have

<P>received the same compliment.&nbsp; He had an affectionate heart.

<P>He must love somebody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She saw no reason against their being happy.&nbsp; Louisa had fine

<P>naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.

<P>He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast

<P>for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;

<P>of course they had fallen in love over poetry.&nbsp; The idea of

<P>Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,

<P>and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt

<P>of its being so.&nbsp; The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,

<P>might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to

<P>the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have

<P>influenced her fate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible

<P>of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man,

<P>there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;

<P>and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing

<P>to be regretted.&nbsp; No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart

<P>beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks

<P>when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.

<P>She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.

<P>They were too much like joy, senseless joy!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,

<P>it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.

<P>The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove

<P>was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,

<P>perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction.&nbsp; He was not at all ashamed

<P>of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more

<P>about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,

<P>and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of
form,

<P>and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.

<P>They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.

<P>He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft

<P>seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk

<P>for her life to do him good.&nbsp; Anne saw them wherever she went.

<P>Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,

<P>and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.

<P>Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture

<P>of happiness to her.&nbsp; She always watched them as long as she could,

<P>delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,

<P>as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted

<P>to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered

<P>an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation

<P>when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft

<P>looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;

<P>but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days

<P>after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,

<P>or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town,

<P>and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street

<P>she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.&nbsp; He was standing

<P>by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,

<P>in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have

<P>passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him

<P>before she could catch his notice.&nbsp; When he did perceive and

<P>acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness

<P>and good humour.&nbsp; "Ha! is it you?&nbsp; Thank you, thank you.

<P>This is treating me like a friend.&nbsp; Here I am, you see,

<P>staring at a picture.&nbsp; I can never get by this shop without stopping.

<P>But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!&nbsp; Do look at it.

<P>Did you ever see the like?&nbsp; What queer fellows your fine painters
must be,

<P>to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless

<P>old cockleshell as that?&nbsp; And yet here are two gentlemen

<P>stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the
rocks

<P>and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,

<P>which they certainly must be.&nbsp; I wonder where that boat was built!"

<P>(laughing heartily); "I would not venture over a horsepond in it.

<P>Well," (turning away), "now, where are you bound?&nbsp; Can I go anywhere

<P>for you, or with you?&nbsp; Can I be of any use?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company

<P>the little way our road lies together.&nbsp; I am going home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.&nbsp; Yes, yes

<P>we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you

<P>as we go along.&nbsp; There, take my arm; that's right; I do not

<P>feel comfortable if I have not a woman there.&nbsp; Lord! what a boat
it is!"

<P>taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I have, presently.&nbsp; But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;

<P>I shall only say, `How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.&nbsp; I shall
not stop.

<P>`How d'ye do?'&nbsp; Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.

<P>She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.&nbsp; She has a blister on one of
her heels,

<P>as large as a three-shilling piece.&nbsp; If you look across the street,

<P>you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.&nbsp; Shabby
fellows,

<P>both of them!&nbsp; I am glad they are not on this side of the way.

<P>Sophy cannot bear them.&nbsp; They played me a pitiful trick once:

<P>got away with some of my best men.&nbsp; I will tell you the whole story

<P>another time.&nbsp; There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.

<P>Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.

<P>Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.&nbsp; Poor old Sir
Archibald!

<P>How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?&nbsp; It suits us very well.

<P>We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets

<P>full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;

<P>and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,

<P>and draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch,

<P>ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.

<P>We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,

<P>for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.

<P>The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again

<P>for what he had to communicate.&nbsp; She hoped when clear of Milsom
Street

<P>to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,

<P>for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had

<P>gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was

<P>not really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.

<P>As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.

<P>But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady

<P>I am going to talk about.&nbsp; That young lady, you know, that we have

<P>all been so concerned for.&nbsp; The Miss Musgrove, that all this has
been

<P>happening to.&nbsp; Her Christian name:&nbsp; I always forget her Christian
name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really

<P>did; but now she could safely suggest the name of "Louisa."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.&nbsp; I wish young
ladies

<P>had not such a number of fine Christian names.&nbsp; I should never
be out

<P>if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.&nbsp; Well,

<P>this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.

<P>He was courting her week after week.&nbsp; The only wonder was,

<P>what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;

<P>then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain

<P>was set to right.&nbsp; But even then there was something odd in their

<P>way of going on.&nbsp; Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,

<P>and then he went off to see Edward.&nbsp; When we came back from Minehead

<P>he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since.

<P>We have seen nothing of him since November.&nbsp; Even Sophy could

<P>not understand it.&nbsp; But now, the matter has take the strangest
turn of all;

<P>for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being

<P>to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.&nbsp; You know James
Benwick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A little.&nbsp; I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, she is to marry him.&nbsp; Nay, most likely they are married
already,

<P>for I do not know what they should wait for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man," said Anne,

<P>"and I understand that he bears an excellent character."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.

<P>He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are

<P>bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.

<P>An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,

<P>zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,

<P>for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit

<P>from Captain Benwick's manners.&nbsp; I thought them particularly pleasing,

<P>and I will answer for it, they would generally please."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather
too

<P>piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,

<P>Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.

<P>There is something about Frederick more to our taste."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was caught.&nbsp; She had only meant to oppose the too common idea

<P>of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,

<P>not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best

<P>that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,

<P>she was beginning to say, "I was not entering into any comparison

<P>of the two friends," but the Admiral interrupted her with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And the thing is certainly true.&nbsp; It is not a mere bit of gossip.

<P>We have it from Frederick himself.&nbsp; His sister had a letter

<P>from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had
it

<P>in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.

<P>I fancy they are all at Uppercross."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,

<P>"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain

<P>Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.

<P>It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him

<P>and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out

<P>on each side equally, and without violence.&nbsp; I hope his letter

<P>does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur

<P>from beginning to end."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne looked down to hide her smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has

<P>too much spirit for that.&nbsp; If the girl likes another man better,

<P>it is very fit she should have him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing

<P>in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose

<P>he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,

<P>you know, without its being absolutely said.&nbsp; I should be very
sorry

<P>that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick

<P>should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, I understand you.&nbsp; But there is nothing at all of that
nature

<P>in the letter.&nbsp; He does not give the least fling at Benwick;

<P>does not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own

<P>for wondering at it.'&nbsp; No, you would not guess, from his way of
writing,

<P>that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.

<P>He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is

<P>nothing very unforgiving in that, I think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant

<P>to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.

<P>She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet

<P>attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Frederick!" said he at last.&nbsp; "Now he must begin all over
again

<P>with somebody else.&nbsp; I think we must get him to Bath.&nbsp; Sophy
must write,

<P>and beg him to come to Bath.&nbsp; Here are pretty girls enough, I am
sure.

<P>It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other

<P>Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.

<P>Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?"
