<P>Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party

<P>the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.

<P>They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,

<P>which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur

<P>which so flat a shore admitted.&nbsp; They praised the morning;

<P>gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling

<P>breeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,

<P>the sea-air always does good.&nbsp; There can be no doubt of its having
been

<P>of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,

<P>last spring twelve-month.&nbsp; He declares himself, that coming to
Lyme

<P>for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;

<P>and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.

<P>Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live

<P>entirely by the sea.&nbsp; I do think he had better leave Uppercross
entirely,

<P>and fix at Lyme.&nbsp; Do not you, Anne?&nbsp; Do not you agree with
me,

<P>that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?

<P>She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would

<P>make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad

<P>to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,

<P>in case of his having another seizure.&nbsp; Indeed I think it quite
melancholy

<P>to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been

<P>doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place

<P>like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out

<P>from all the world.&nbsp; I wish his friends would propose it to him.

<P>I really think they ought.&nbsp; And, as to procuring a dispensation,

<P>there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.

<P>My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.

<P>He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous

<P>I must say.&nbsp; Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?

<P>Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,

<P>when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,

<P>which may be just as well performed by another person?&nbsp; And at
Lyme too,

<P>only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,

<P>if people thought there was anything to complain of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,

<P>and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into

<P>the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good

<P>of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?

<P>She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;

<P>felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very

<P>desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young
man,

<P>as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at

<P>the advantage of such resident curate's being married.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish," said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,

<P>"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate

<P>with Dr Shirley.&nbsp; I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman
of

<P>the greatest influence with everybody!&nbsp; I always look upon her
as able

<P>to persuade a person to anything!&nbsp; I am afraid of her, as I have

<P>told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;

<P>but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour

<P>at Uppercross."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful,

<P>and amused also that the course of events and the new interests

<P>of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour

<P>with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,

<P>for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman

<P>were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,

<P>on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.

<P>They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;

<P>but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something

<P>to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the
town.

<P>They were all at her disposal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,

<P>at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,

<P>and stopped to give them way.&nbsp; They ascended and passed him;

<P>and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her

<P>with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible
of.

<P>She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,

<P>having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind

<P>which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye

<P>which it had also produced.&nbsp; It was evident that the gentleman,

<P>(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.

<P>Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which

<P>shewed his noticing of it.&nbsp; He gave her a momentary glance,

<P>a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, "That man is struck with
you,

<P>and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about

<P>a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards

<P>quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against

<P>the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.

<P>She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,

<P>and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about

<P>near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.

<P>Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.

<P>It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;

<P>and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again

<P>by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely,

<P>and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was

<P>a man of exceedingly good manners.&nbsp; He seemed about thirty,

<P>and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.&nbsp; Anne felt that

<P>she should like to know who he was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,

<P>(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the
party

<P>to the window.&nbsp; It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle,

<P>but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;

<P>somebody must be going away.&nbsp; It was driven by a servant in mourning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might

<P>compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity,

<P>and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner

<P>of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows

<P>and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at
Anne,

<P>"it is the very man we passed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him

<P>as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.

<P>The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray," said Captain Wentworth, immediately, "can you tell us the name

<P>of the gentleman who is just gone away?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night

<P>from Sidmouth.&nbsp; Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you
were

<P>at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath

<P>and London."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Elliot!"&nbsp; Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated
the name,

<P>before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity

<P>of a waiter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless me!" cried Mary; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,

<P>it must, indeed!&nbsp; Charles, Anne, must not it?&nbsp; In mourning,
you see,

<P>just as our Mr Elliot must be.&nbsp; How very extraordinary!

<P>In the very same inn with us!&nbsp; Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?

<P>my father's next heir?&nbsp; Pray sir," turning to the waiter,

<P>"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged

<P>to the Kellynch family?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said

<P>his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some
day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There! you see!" cried Mary in an ecstasy, "just as I said!

<P>Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!&nbsp; I was sure that would come out,

<P>if it was so.&nbsp; Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his
servants

<P>take care to publish, wherever he goes.&nbsp; But, Anne, only conceive

<P>how extraordinary!&nbsp; I wish I had looked at him more.&nbsp; I wish
we had

<P>been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to
us.

<P>What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!

<P>Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?&nbsp; I hardly looked at
him,

<P>I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something

<P>of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!

<P>Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,

<P>so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,

<P>and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,

<P>one should have known him by the livery."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,"

<P>said Captain Wentworth, "we must consider it to be the arrangement

<P>of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried

<P>to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,

<P>been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction

<P>at all desirable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself

<P>to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch

<P>was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.

<P>She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him

<P>the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having

<P>passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt

<P>quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage,

<P>and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been

<P>near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain

<P>a perfect secret.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course," said Mary, "you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,

<P>the next time you write to Bath.&nbsp; I think my father certainly

<P>ought to hear of it; do mention all about him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance

<P>which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,

<P>but as what ought to be suppressed.&nbsp; The offence which had been
given

<P>her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share
in it

<P>she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation
in both

<P>was beyond a doubt.&nbsp; Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the
toil

<P>of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth

<P>fell on Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain

<P>and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed

<P>to take their last walk about Lyme.&nbsp; They ought to be setting off

<P>for Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,

<P>and out of doors as long as they could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all

<P>fairly in the street.&nbsp; Their conversation the preceding evening

<P>did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together

<P>some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,

<P>and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,

<P>to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something

<P>occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead
of

<P>Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Elliot," said he, speaking rather low, "you have done a good deed

<P>in making that poor fellow talk so much.&nbsp; I wish he could have

<P>such company oftener.&nbsp; It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up
as he is;

<P>but what can we do?&nbsp; We cannot part."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Anne, "that I can easily believe to be impossible;

<P>but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,

<P>and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend

<P>may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ay, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only June."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,

<P>just made into the Grappler.&nbsp; I was at Plymouth dreading to hear
of him;

<P>he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.

<P>There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.

<P>I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.&nbsp; Nobody could
do it,

<P>but that good fellow" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)&nbsp; "The Laconia

<P>had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her

<P>being sent to sea again.&nbsp; He stood his chance for the rest;

<P>wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,

<P>travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off

<P>to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.

<P>That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.

<P>You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much

<P>in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed

<P>able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,

<P>and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have

<P>quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction

<P>of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would

<P>accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.

<P>By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they
drew

<P>near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,

<P>all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,

<P>that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,

<P>would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,

<P>and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which

<P>may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville

<P>at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,

<P>who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make

<P>the proper adieus to the Cobb.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.&nbsp; Lord Byron's

<P>"dark blue seas" could not fail of being brought forward by

<P>their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long
as

<P>attention was possible.&nbsp; It was soon drawn, perforce another way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant

<P>for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,

<P>and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep
flight,

<P>excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.

<P>In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;

<P>the sensation was delightful to her.&nbsp; The hardness of the pavement

<P>for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;

<P>he did it, however.&nbsp; She was safely down, and instantly,

<P>to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.

<P>He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,

<P>he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, "I am determined

<P>I will:" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,

<P>she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!

<P>There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,

<P>she breathed not, her face was like death.&nbsp; The horror of the moment

<P>to all who stood around!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,

<P>looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.

<P>"She is dead! she is dead!" screamed Mary, catching hold of her

<P>husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;

<P>and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost

<P>her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain

<P>Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is there no one to help me?" were the first words which

<P>burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if

<P>all his own strength were gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go to him, go to him," cried Anne, "for heaven's sake go to him.

<P>I can support her myself.&nbsp; Leave me, and go to him.&nbsp; Rub her
hands,

<P>rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,

<P>disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;

<P>and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,

<P>and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;

<P>while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,

<P>exclaimed in the bitterest agony--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh God! her father and mother!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A surgeon!" said Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--

<P>"True, true, a surgeon this instant," was darting away,

<P>when Anne eagerly suggested--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?

<P>He knows where a surgeon is to be found."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,

<P>and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had

<P>resigned the poor corpse-like&nbsp; figure entirely to the brother's
care,

<P>and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said

<P>which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:

<P>Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate

<P>brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his
eyes

<P>from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,

<P>or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him

<P>for help which he could not give.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,

<P>which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,

<P>to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,

<P>to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Both seemed to look
to her

<P>for directions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anne, Anne," cried Charles, "What is to be done next?

<P>What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Had not she better be carried to the inn?&nbsp; Yes, I am sure:

<P>carry her gently to the inn."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, to the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively

<P>collected, and eager to be doing something.&nbsp; "I will carry her
myself.

<P>Musgrove, take care of the others."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen

<P>and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,

<P>to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of

<P>a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as
fine

<P>as the first report.&nbsp; To some of the best-looking of these good
people

<P>Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,

<P>she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,

<P>and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back

<P>with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,

<P>and so light of heart, they had passed along.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.

<P>Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance

<P>which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,

<P>informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.

<P>Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves

<P>that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife

<P>decided what was to be done.&nbsp; She must be taken to their house;

<P>all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.

<P>They would not listen to scruples:&nbsp; he was obeyed; they were all

<P>beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction,

<P>was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,

<P>assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband

<P>to all who needed them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,

<P>without apparent consciousness.&nbsp; This had been a proof of life,

<P>however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly

<P>incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,

<P>by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.

<P>Mary, too, was growing calmer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.

<P>They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.

<P>The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries

<P>recovered from:&nbsp; he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say

<P>a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;

<P>and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,

<P>after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,

<P>may be conceived.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!" was uttered

<P>by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;

<P>nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over
it

<P>with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by

<P>the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection

<P>to calm them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Louisa's limbs had escaped.&nbsp; There was no injury but to the head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
done,

<P>as to their general situation.&nbsp; They were now able to speak to
each other

<P>and consult.&nbsp; That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing

<P>to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,

<P>did not admit a doubt.&nbsp; Her removal was impossible.&nbsp; The Harvilles

<P>silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.

<P>They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others

<P>began to reflect.&nbsp; Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,

<P>and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.

<P>They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;

<P>and yet perhaps, by "putting the children away in the maid's room,

<P>or swinging a cot somewhere," they could hardly bear to think of not

<P>finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to
stay;

<P>though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not
be

<P>the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.

<P>Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,

<P>who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,

<P>was just such another.&nbsp; Between these two, she could want

<P>no possible attendance by day or night.&nbsp; And all this was said

<P>with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,

<P>and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and
terror.

<P>"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross;

<P>the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;

<P>the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they

<P>ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time."

<P>At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose

<P>than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,

<P>exerting himself, said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.

<P>Every minute is valuable.&nbsp; Some one must resolve on being off

<P>for Uppercross instantly.&nbsp; Musgrove, either you or I must go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.

<P>He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;

<P>but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor
would.

<P>So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.

<P>She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.&nbsp; The usefulness

<P>of her staying!&nbsp; She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's
room,

<P>or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!

<P>She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,

<P>yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought

<P>of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,

<P>she was anxious to be at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly

<P>down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed,

<P>for the parlour door was open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then it is settled, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth,

<P>"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.

<P>But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,

<P>I think it need be only one.&nbsp; Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,

<P>wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,

<P>so capable as Anne."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself

<P>so spoken of.&nbsp; The other two warmly agreed with what he said,

<P>and she then appeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;" cried he,

<P>turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,

<P>which seemed almost restoring the past.&nbsp; She coloured deeply,

<P>and he recollected himself and moved away.&nbsp; She expressed herself

<P>most willing, ready, happy to remain.&nbsp; "It was what she had been

<P>thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.&nbsp; A bed on the floor

<P>in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville

<P>would but think so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One thing more, and all seemed arranged.&nbsp; Though it was rather
desirable

<P>that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some

<P>share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses

<P>to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;

<P>and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,

<P>that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,

<P>and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home

<P>the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage

<P>of sending an account of Louisa's night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,

<P>and to be soon followed by the two ladies.&nbsp; When the plan was

<P>made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.

<P>She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice

<P>in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was

<P>nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right

<P>to stay in Henrietta's stead!&nbsp; Why was not she to be as useful
as Anne?

<P>And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!

<P>No, it was too unkind.&nbsp; And in short, she said more than her husband

<P>could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose

<P>when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne

<P>was inevitable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous

<P>and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off

<P>for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick

<P>attending to her.&nbsp; She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried
along,

<P>to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed

<P>earlier in the morning.&nbsp; There she had listened to Henrietta's
schemes

<P>for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had

<P>first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given

<P>to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,

<P>united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt

<P>an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even

<P>in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing

<P>their acquaintance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in
waiting,

<P>stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;

<P>but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister

<P>for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,

<P>the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened
to,

<P>made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her

<P>that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.&nbsp; Without emulating

<P>the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have

<P>attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,

<P>for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust

<P>as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the mean while she was in the carriage.&nbsp; He had handed them
both in,

<P>and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these

<P>circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted
Lyme.

<P>How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;

<P>what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.

<P>It was all quite natural, however.&nbsp; He was devoted to Henrietta;

<P>always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the
view

<P>of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.&nbsp; In general,

<P>his voice and manner were studiously calm.&nbsp; To spare Henrietta

<P>from agitation seemed the governing principle.&nbsp; Once only,

<P>when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated

<P>walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,

<P>he burst forth, as if wholly overcome--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it," he cried.&nbsp; "Oh God! that
I had

<P>not given way to her at the fatal moment!&nbsp; Had I done as I ought!

<P>But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness

<P>of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage

<P>of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,

<P>like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions

<P>and limits.&nbsp; She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel

<P>that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness

<P>as a very resolute character.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They got on fast.&nbsp; Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills

<P>and the same objects so soon.&nbsp; Their actual speed, heightened by

<P>some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long

<P>as on the day before.&nbsp; It was growing quite dusk, however,

<P>before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been

<P>total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back

<P>in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her

<P>having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last
hill,

<P>Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.

<P>In a low, cautious voice, he said: --
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been considering what we had best do.&nbsp; She must not

<P>appear at first.&nbsp; She could not stand it.&nbsp; I have been thinking
whether

<P>you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in

<P>and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.&nbsp; Do you think this is a good
plan?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She did:&nbsp; he was satisfied, and said no more.&nbsp; But the remembrance

<P>of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,

<P>and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became

<P>a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,

<P>and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be
hoped,

<P>and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced

<P>his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;

<P>and when the horses were baited, he was off.
