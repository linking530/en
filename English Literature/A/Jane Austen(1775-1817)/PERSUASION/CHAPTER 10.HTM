<P>Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.

<P>Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough

<P>to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,

<P>where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;

<P>for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,

<P>she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory

<P>and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.

<P>They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.

<P>It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,

<P>end in love with some.&nbsp; Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,

<P>and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.

<P>Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were
about,

<P>and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves
to.

<P>She did not attribute guile to any.&nbsp; It was the highest satisfaction

<P>to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware

<P>of the pain he was occasioning.&nbsp; There was no triumph, no pitiful
triumph

<P>in his manner.&nbsp; He had, probably, never heard, and never thought
of

<P>any claims of Charles Hayter.&nbsp; He was only wrong in accepting

<P>the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at
once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.

<P>Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;

<P>a most decided change.&nbsp; He had even refused one regular invitation
to dinner;

<P>and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large
books

<P>before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,

<P>and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.

<P>It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal

<P>from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence

<P>of seeing him to-morrow.&nbsp; Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter

<P>was wise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth

<P>being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage

<P>were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window

<P>by the sisters from the Mansion-house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came

<P>through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to
say,

<P>that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded

<P>Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,

<P>with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes,

<P>I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;"

<P>Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely

<P>what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity

<P>which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being

<P>to be communicated, and everything being to be done together,

<P>however undesired and inconvenient.&nbsp; She tried to dissuade Mary
from going,

<P>but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept

<P>the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,

<P>as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening

<P>the interference in any plan of their own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,"

<P>said Mary, as she went up stairs.&nbsp; "Everybody is always supposing

<P>that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,

<P>if we had refused to join them.&nbsp; When people come in this manner

<P>on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.&nbsp; They had
taken out

<P>a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.

<P>Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready

<P>for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.&nbsp; Could Anne

<P>have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,

<P>from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it
was

<P>too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together

<P>in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently

<P>considered the walk as under their guidance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where

<P>the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,

<P>to keep with her brother and sister.&nbsp; Her pleasure in the walk

<P>must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of

<P>the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,

<P>and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical

<P>descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and

<P>inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,

<P>that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,

<P>some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.

<P>She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings

<P>and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach

<P>of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,

<P>she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.

<P>It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,

<P>might fall into.&nbsp; He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.

<P>Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.

<P>This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech

<P>of Louisa's which struck her.&nbsp; After one of the many praises of
the day,

<P>which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!&nbsp; They meant
to take

<P>a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from

<P>some of these hills.&nbsp; They talked of coming into this side of the
country.

<P>I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.&nbsp; Oh! it does happen

<P>very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;

<P>she would as lieve be tossed out as not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! You make the most of it, I know," cried Louisa, "but if it were

<P>really so, I should do just the same in her place.&nbsp; If I loved
a man,

<P>as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should
ever

<P>separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely

<P>by anybody else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was spoken with enthusiasm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Had you?" cried he, catching the same tone; "I honour you!"

<P>And there was silence between them for a little while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.&nbsp; The sweet
scenes

<P>of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,

<P>fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining

<P>happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,

<P>blessed her memory.&nbsp; She roused herself to say, as they struck
by order

<P>into another path, "Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?"

<P>But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes

<P>to be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;

<P>and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,

<P>where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer

<P>counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning

<P>to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable
hill,

<P>which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view

<P>of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them

<P>an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and

<P>buildings of a farm-yard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary exclaimed, "Bless me! here is Winthrop.&nbsp; I declare I had no
idea!

<P>Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles

<P>walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready

<P>to do as Mary wished; but "No!" said Charles Musgrove, and "No, no!"

<P>cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be

<P>arguing the matter warmly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution

<P>of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,

<P>though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.

<P>But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;

<P>and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter

<P>of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,

<P>"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm

<P>than any sitting down could do her good;" and, in short,

<P>her look and manner declared, that go she would not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,

<P>it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he

<P>and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt

<P>and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top

<P>of the hill.&nbsp; Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;

<P>and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking

<P>to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around
her,

<P>and saying to Captain Wentworth--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!&nbsp; But, I assure
you,

<P>I have never been in the house above twice in my life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,

<P>followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne

<P>perfectly knew the meaning of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:

<P>Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself

<P>on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others

<P>all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,

<P>to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,

<P>and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,

<P>Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,

<P>was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could

<P>prevent her from going to look for a better also.&nbsp; She turned through

<P>the same gate, but could not see them.&nbsp; Anne found a nice seat

<P>for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which

<P>she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.

<P>Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa

<P>had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on

<P>till she overtook her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon
heard

<P>Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if

<P>making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the

<P>centre.&nbsp; They were speaking as they drew near.&nbsp; Louisa's voice
was

<P>the first distinguished.&nbsp; She seemed to be in the middle of some

<P>eager speech.&nbsp; What Anne first heard was--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so, I made her go.&nbsp; I could not bear that she should be frightened

<P>from the visit by such nonsense.&nbsp; What! would I be turned back
from

<P>doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,

<P>by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may
say?

<P>No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.&nbsp; When I have

<P>made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely

<P>to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as
near

<P>giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She would have turned back then, but for you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She would indeed.&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to say it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!&nbsp; After the
hints

<P>you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,

<P>the last time I was in company with him,&nbsp; I need not affect

<P>to have no comprehension of what is going on.&nbsp; I see that more
than

<P>a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;

<P>and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,

<P>when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and

<P>strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist

<P>idle interference in such a trifle as this.&nbsp; Your sister is

<P>an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,

<P>I see.&nbsp; If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much

<P>of your own spirit into her as you can.&nbsp; But this, no doubt,

<P>you have been always doing.&nbsp; It is the worst evil of too yielding

<P>and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended
on.

<P>You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody

<P>may sway it.&nbsp; Let those who would be happy be firm.&nbsp; Here
is a nut,"

<P>said he, catching one down from an upper bough.&nbsp; "to exemplify:

<P>a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,

<P>has outlived all the storms of autumn.&nbsp; Not a puncture, not

<P>a weak spot anywhere.&nbsp; This nut," he continued, with playful solemnity,

<P>"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,

<P>is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be

<P>supposed capable of."&nbsp; Then returning to his former earnest tone--

<P>"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should
be firm.

<P>If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,

<P>she will cherish all her present powers of mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had done, and was unanswered.&nbsp; It would have surprised Anne
if Louisa

<P>could have readily answered such a speech:&nbsp; words of such interest,

<P>spoken with such serious warmth!&nbsp; She could imagine what Louisa
was feeling.

<P>For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.

<P>While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,

<P>and they were moving on.&nbsp; Before they were beyond her hearing,

<P>however, Louisa spoke again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects," said she;

<P>"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense

<P>and pride-- the Elliot pride.&nbsp; She has a great deal too much

<P>of the Elliot pride.&nbsp; We do so wish that Charles had married Anne
instead.

<P>I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you mean that she refused him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes; certainly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When did that happen?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;

<P>but I believe about a year before he married Mary.&nbsp; I wish she
had

<P>accepted him.&nbsp; We should all have liked her a great deal better;

<P>and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend

<P>Lady Russell's doing, that she did not.&nbsp; They think Charles

<P>might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,

<P>and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.

<P>Her own emotions still kept her fixed.&nbsp; She had much to recover
from,

<P>before she could move.&nbsp; The listener's proverbial fate was

<P>not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard

<P>a great deal of very painful import.&nbsp; She saw how her own character

<P>was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree

<P>of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her

<P>extreme agitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,

<P>and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,

<P>felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards

<P>collected, and once more in motion together.&nbsp; Her spirits wanted

<P>the solitude and silence which only numbers could give.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,

<P>Charles Hayter with them.&nbsp; The minutiae of the business Anne

<P>could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem

<P>admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing

<P>on the gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they

<P>were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.

<P>Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--

<P>Charles Hayter exceedingly happy:&nbsp; and they were devoted to each
other

<P>almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;

<P>nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,

<P>or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much

<P>as the other two.&nbsp; In a long strip of meadow land, where there
was

<P>ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct
parties;

<P>and to that party of the three which boasted least animation,

<P>and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.&nbsp; She joined
Charles

<P>and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm;

<P>but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper

<P>with his wife.&nbsp; Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,

<P>and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was

<P>his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads

<P>of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began

<P>to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,

<P>in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,

<P>he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had

<P>a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of
it

<P>was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,

<P>the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been

<P>some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's
gig.

<P>He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.

<P>Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,

<P>they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;

<P>it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.

<P>The invitation was general, and generally declined.&nbsp; The Miss Musgroves

<P>were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked

<P>before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride

<P>could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an

<P>opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,

<P>when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something

<P>to his sister.&nbsp; The something might be guessed by its effects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired," cried Mrs Croft.

<P>"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.&nbsp; Here is excellent
room

<P>for three, I assure you.&nbsp; If we were all like you, I believe we
might

<P>sit four.&nbsp; You must, indeed, you must."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,

<P>she was not allowed to proceed.&nbsp; The Admiral's kind urgency

<P>came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused;

<P>they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space

<P>to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,

<P>turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yes; he had done it.&nbsp; She was in the carriage, and felt that he
had

<P>placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it,

<P>that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution

<P>to give her rest.&nbsp; She was very much affected by the view of

<P>his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.

<P>This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone
before.

<P>She understood him.&nbsp; He could not forgive her, but he could not

<P>be unfeeling.&nbsp; Though condemning her for the past, and considering
it

<P>with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,

<P>and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her
suffer,

<P>without the desire of giving her relief.&nbsp; It was a remainder

<P>of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged

<P>friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,

<P>which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded

<P>of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions

<P>were at first unconsciously given.&nbsp; They had travelled half their
way

<P>along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.

<P>She then found them talking of "Frederick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,"

<P>said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.&nbsp; He has been

<P>running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his
mind.

<P>Ay, this comes of the peace.&nbsp; If it were war now, he would have

<P>settled it long ago.&nbsp; We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to
make

<P>long courtships in time of war.&nbsp; How many days was it, my dear,

<P>between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together

<P>in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;

<P>"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,

<P>she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.

<P>I had known you by character, however, long before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we

<P>to wait for besides?&nbsp; I do not like having such things so long
in hand.

<P>I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home

<P>one of these young ladies to Kellynch.&nbsp; Then there would always

<P>be company for them.&nbsp; And very nice young ladies they both are;

<P>I hardly know one from the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs Croft,

<P>in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that

<P>her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy

<P>of her brother; "and a very respectable family.&nbsp; One could not
be
