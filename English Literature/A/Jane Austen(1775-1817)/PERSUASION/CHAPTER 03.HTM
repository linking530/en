<P>"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr Shepherd

<P>one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,

<P>"that the present juncture is much in our favour.&nbsp; This peace will

<P>be turning all our rich naval officers ashore.&nbsp; They will be

<P>all wanting a home.&nbsp; Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,

<P>for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.

<P>Many a noble fortune has been made during the war.&nbsp; If a rich admiral

<P>were to come in our way, Sir Walter--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd," replied Sir Walter;

<P>"that's all I have to remark.&nbsp; A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall

<P>be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken

<P>ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,

<P>gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.&nbsp; I have had a little
knowledge

<P>of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they

<P>have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants

<P>as any set of people one should meet with.&nbsp; Therefore, Sir Walter,

<P>what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of

<P>any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated

<P>as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep

<P>the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice

<P>and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,

<P>might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think
it

<P>worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon
him

<P>which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much

<P>I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,

<P>with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;

<P>in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications

<P>will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy

<P>naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,

<P>that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you

<P>the trouble of replying."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter only nodded.&nbsp; But soon afterwards, rising and pacing
the room,

<P>he observed sarcastically--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would

<P>not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"

<P>said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:&nbsp; her father had driven
her over,

<P>nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch:

<P>"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be

<P>a very desirable tenant.&nbsp; I have known a good deal of the profession;

<P>and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful

<P>in all their ways!&nbsp; These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,

<P>if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.&nbsp; Everything
in

<P>and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!

<P>The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order

<P>as they are now.&nbsp; You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your
own

<P>sweet flower gardens being neglected."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As to all that," rejoined Sir Walter coolly, "supposing I were induced

<P>to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges

<P>to be annexed to it.&nbsp; I am not particularly disposed to favour
a tenant.

<P>The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,

<P>or men of any other description, can have had such a range;

<P>but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,

<P>is another thing.&nbsp; I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies
being

<P>always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her
guard

<P>with respect to her flower garden.&nbsp; I am very little disposed

<P>to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,

<P>I assure you, be he sailor or soldier."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In all these cases, there are established usages which

<P>make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.

<P>Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.&nbsp; Depend upon
me

<P>for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.

<P>I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous

<P>for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Anne spoke--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least

<P>an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and

<P>all the privileges which any home can give.&nbsp; Sailors work hard
enough

<P>for their comforts, we must all allow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true, very true.&nbsp; What Miss Anne says, is very true,"

<P>was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and "Oh! certainly," was his daughter's;

<P>but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see

<P>any friend of mine belonging to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds

<P>of objection to it.&nbsp; First, as being the means of bringing persons

<P>of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours

<P>which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,

<P>as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows
old

<P>sooner than any other man.&nbsp; I have observed it all my life.

<P>A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise

<P>of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,

<P>and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in

<P>any other line.&nbsp; One day last spring, in town, I was in company

<P>with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;

<P>Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,

<P>without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,

<P>and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage

<P>you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged

<P>to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,

<P>and nothing but a dab of powder at top.&nbsp; `In the name of heaven,

<P>who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing
near,

<P>(Sir Basil Morley).&nbsp; `Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral
Baldwin.

<P>What do you take his age to be?'&nbsp; `Sixty,' said I, `or perhaps
sixty-two.'

<P>`Forty,' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.'&nbsp; Picture to yourselves

<P>my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.

<P>I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can
do;

<P>but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:&nbsp; they are
all

<P>knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,

<P>till they are not fit to be seen.&nbsp; It is a pity they are not knocked

<P>on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, Sir Walter," cried Mrs Clay, "this is being severe indeed.

<P>Have a little mercy on the poor men.&nbsp; We are not all born to be
handsome.

<P>The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;

<P>I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.&nbsp; But then,

<P>is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?

<P>Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:&nbsp; and even
in

<P>the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,

<P>if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural

<P>effect of time.&nbsp; The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician

<P>is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even

<P>the clergyman--" she stopt a moment to consider what might

<P>do for the clergyman;--"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged

<P>to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to

<P>all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.&nbsp; In fact, as I have

<P>long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable

<P>in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow
any,

<P>who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,

<P>following their own pursuits, and living on their own property,

<P>without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,

<P>to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:

<P>I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness

<P>when they cease to be quite young."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak

<P>Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant,

<P>had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application

<P>for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards

<P>fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and
indeed,

<P>he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.

<P>By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,

<P>Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired

<P>a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,

<P>and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places

<P>in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;

<P>that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,

<P>Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a secret,)--

<P>accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,

<P>and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner,

<P>he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,

<P>and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong

<P>an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description

<P>could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,

<P>every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And who is Admiral Croft?" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family,

<P>and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,

<P>added--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is a rear admiral of the white.&nbsp; He was in the Trafalgar action,

<P>and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,

<P>I believe, several years."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I take it for granted," observed Sir Walter, "that his face

<P>is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,

<P>hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,

<P>but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;

<P>not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted

<P>a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;

<P>knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished

<P>house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised

<P>if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;

<P>would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point
of it;

<P>said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all

<P>the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him

<P>peculiarly desirable as a tenant.&nbsp; He was a married man,

<P>and without children; the very state to be wished for.&nbsp; A house
was

<P>never taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:

<P>he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering

<P>as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.

<P>A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture

<P>in the world.&nbsp; He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton

<P>with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were

<P>talking the matter over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,"

<P>continued he; "asked more questions about the house, and terms,

<P>and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant

<P>with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite

<P>unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,

<P>she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;

<P>she told me so herself:&nbsp; sister to the gentleman who lived

<P>a few years back at Monkford.&nbsp; Bless me! what was his name?

<P>At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so
lately.

<P>Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman

<P>who lived at Monkford:&nbsp; Mrs Croft's brother?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not

<P>hear the appeal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember

<P>no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bless me! how very odd!&nbsp; I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.

<P>A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman

<P>so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,

<P>I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man

<P>breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;

<P>caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,

<P>submitted to an amicable compromise.&nbsp; Very odd indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After waiting another moment--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wentworth was the very name!&nbsp; Mr Wentworth was the very man.

<P>He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,

<P>for two or three years.&nbsp; Came there about the year ---5, I take
it.

<P>You remember him, I am sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wentworth?&nbsp; Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.

<P>You misled me by the term gentleman.&nbsp; I thought you were speaking
of

<P>some man of property:&nbsp; Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;

<P>quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.

<P>One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them

<P>no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,

<P>with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably

<P>in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea

<P>they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for

<P>the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked

<P>nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:

<P>an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in

<P>the secret of Sir Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with

<P>an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them

<P>infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest
terms,

<P>he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,

<P>and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained

<P>at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough

<P>of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,

<P>in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.

<P>So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little

<P>additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just

<P>high enough, and not too high.&nbsp; "I have let my house to Admiral
Croft,"

<P>would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;

<P>a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs

<P>a note of explanation.&nbsp; An admiral speaks his own consequence,

<P>and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.

<P>In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever

<P>have the precedence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:

<P>but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,

<P>that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;

<P>and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had

<P>such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener

<P>to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her

<P>flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,

<P>with a gentle sigh, "A few months more, and he, perhaps,

<P>may be walking here.
