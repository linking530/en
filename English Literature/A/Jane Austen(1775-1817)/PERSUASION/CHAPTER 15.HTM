<P>Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,

<P>a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;

<P>and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment

<P>of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh! when shall I

<P>leave you again?"&nbsp; A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,

<P>in the welcome she received, did her good.&nbsp; Her father and sister

<P>were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,

<P>and met her with kindness.&nbsp; Her making a fourth, when they

<P>sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and
smiles

<P>were more a matter of course.&nbsp; Anne had always felt that she would

<P>pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the
others

<P>was unlooked for.&nbsp; They were evidently in excellent spirits,

<P>and she was soon to listen to the causes.&nbsp; They had no inclination

<P>to listen to her.&nbsp; After laying out for some compliments of being

<P>deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,

<P>they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be

<P>all their own.&nbsp; Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:

<P>it was all Bath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered

<P>their expectations in every respect.&nbsp; Their house was undoubtedly

<P>the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages

<P>over all the others which they had either seen or heard of,

<P>and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,

<P>or the taste of the furniture.&nbsp; Their acquaintance was

<P>exceedingly sought after.&nbsp; Everybody was wanting to visit them.

<P>They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were

<P>perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here were funds of enjoyment.&nbsp; Could Anne wonder that her father

<P>and sister were happy?&nbsp; She might not wonder, but she must sigh

<P>that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see

<P>nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,

<P>should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;

<P>and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open

<P>the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room

<P>to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,

<P>who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of

<P>between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this was not all which they had to make them happy.

<P>They had Mr Elliot too.&nbsp; Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.

<P>He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.

<P>He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath

<P>in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of

<P>Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him,

<P>though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able

<P>to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,

<P>and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card

<P>in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,

<P>and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,

<P>such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received

<P>as a relation again, that their former good understanding

<P>was completely re-established.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had not a fault to find in him.&nbsp; He had explained away

<P>all the appearance of neglect on his own side.&nbsp; It had originated

<P>in misapprehension entirely.&nbsp; He had never had an idea of

<P>throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,

<P>but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.&nbsp; Upon the hint

<P>of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family

<P>and the family honours, he was quite indignant.&nbsp; He, who had ever
boasted

<P>of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,

<P>were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.

<P>He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct

<P>must refute it.&nbsp; He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;

<P>and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity

<P>of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation

<P>and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of

<P>much extenuation.&nbsp; This was an article not to be entered on by
himself;

<P>but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly

<P>respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,

<P>Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough

<P>Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted

<P>to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things

<P>relative to the marriage, which made a material difference

<P>in the discredit of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted

<P>also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.

<P>She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,

<P>accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.

<P>There had been the charm.&nbsp; She had sought him.&nbsp; Without that
attraction,

<P>not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,

<P>moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.

<P>Here was a great deal to soften the business.&nbsp; A very fine woman

<P>with a large fortune, in love with him!&nbsp; Sir Walter seemed to admit
it

<P>as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance

<P>in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,

<P>evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they

<P>gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof

<P>of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being

<P>on intimate terms in Camden Place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.&nbsp; Allowances,

<P>large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who
spoke.

<P>She heard it all under embellishment.&nbsp; All that sounded extravagant

<P>or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin

<P>but in the language of the relators.&nbsp; Still, however, she had

<P>the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,

<P>in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years,

<P>to be well received by them.&nbsp; In a worldly view, he had nothing
to gain

<P>by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.

<P>In all probability he was already the richer of the two,

<P>and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.

<P>A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,

<P>why should it be an object to him?&nbsp; She could only offer one solution;

<P>it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.&nbsp; There might really have
been

<P>a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him

<P>a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,

<P>he might mean to pay his addresses to her.&nbsp; Elizabeth was certainly

<P>very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character

<P>might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,

<P>and when very young himself.&nbsp; How her temper and understanding

<P>might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life

<P>was another concern and rather a fearful one.&nbsp; Most earnestly did
she wish

<P>that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth

<P>were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself
so,

<P>and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent

<P>by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits

<P>were talked of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without

<P>being much attended to.&nbsp; "Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.

<P>They did not know.&nbsp; It might be him, perhaps."&nbsp; They could
not listen

<P>to her description of him.&nbsp; They were describing him themselves;

<P>Sir Walter especially.&nbsp; He did justice to his very gentlemanlike

<P>appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,

<P>his sensible eye; but, at the same time, "must lament his being

<P>very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;

<P>nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered

<P>almost every feature for the worse.&nbsp; Mr Elliot appeared to think

<P>that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when

<P>they last parted;" but Sir Walter had "not been able to return

<P>the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.&nbsp; He did not
mean

<P>to complain, however.&nbsp; Mr Elliot was better to look at than most
men,

<P>and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of

<P>the whole evening.&nbsp; "Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be

<P>introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!"

<P>and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,

<P>as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot

<P>spoke of her as "a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known

<P>in Camden Place," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.

<P>Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be

<P>an excessively pretty woman, beautiful.&nbsp; "He longed to see her.

<P>He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces

<P>he was continually passing in the streets.&nbsp; The worst of Bath was

<P>the number of its plain women.&nbsp; He did not mean to say that there
were

<P>no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.

<P>He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face

<P>would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,

<P>as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted

<P>eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being

<P>a tolerable face among them.&nbsp; It had been a frosty morning,

<P>to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand

<P>could stand the test of.&nbsp; But still, there certainly were

<P>a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!

<P>they were infinitely worse.&nbsp; Such scarecrows as the streets were
full of!

<P>It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything

<P>tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.

<P>He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis

<P>(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing

<P>that every woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be

<P>upon Colonel Wallis."&nbsp; Modest Sir Walter!&nbsp; He was not allowed

<P>to escape, however.&nbsp; His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting

<P>that Colonel Wallis's companion might have as good a figure

<P>as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How is Mary looking?" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.

<P>"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not

<P>happen every day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.&nbsp; In general she
has been

<P>in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,

<P>and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,

<P>or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the
door

<P>suspended everything.&nbsp; "A knock at the door! and so late!

<P>It was ten o'clock.&nbsp; Could it be Mr Elliot?&nbsp; They knew he
was to dine

<P>in Lansdown Crescent.&nbsp; It was possible that he might stop in his
way home

<P>to ask them how they did.&nbsp; They could think of no one else.

<P>Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock."&nbsp; Mrs Clay was
right.

<P>With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,

<P>Mr Elliot was ushered into the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.

<P>Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,

<P>and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,

<P>but "he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she

<P>nor her friend had taken cold the day before," &amp;c. &amp;c; which
was

<P>all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part

<P>must follow then.&nbsp; Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;

<P>"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter"

<P>(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and

<P>blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features

<P>which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement

<P>at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware

<P>of who she was.&nbsp; He looked completely astonished, but not more
astonished

<P>than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity

<P>he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated

<P>to be received as an acquaintance already.&nbsp; He was quite as good-looking

<P>as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,

<P>and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,

<P>so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them

<P>in excellence to only one person's manners.&nbsp; They were not the
same,

<P>but they were, perhaps, equally good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.

<P>There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.&nbsp; Ten minutes

<P>were enough to certify that.&nbsp; His tone, his expressions,

<P>his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all

<P>the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.&nbsp; As soon as he could,

<P>he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions

<P>respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance

<P>of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;

<P>to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that

<P>he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.

<P>She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.

<P>His regret increased as he listened.&nbsp; He had spent his whole

<P>solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,

<P>mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,

<P>longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion

<P>of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.

<P>If he had but asked who the party were!&nbsp; The name of Musgrove would

<P>have told him enough.&nbsp; "Well, it would serve to cure him of

<P>an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,

<P>which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal

<P>of its being very ungenteel to be curious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," said he,

<P>"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,

<P>are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings

<P>in the world.&nbsp; The folly of the means they often employ

<P>is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:

<P>he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,

<P>and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene

<P>she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.

<P>Having alluded to "an accident,"&nbsp; he must hear the whole.

<P>When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,

<P>but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.

<P>She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish

<P>of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern

<P>for what she must have suffered in witnessing it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He staid an hour with them.&nbsp; The elegant little clock on the mantel-

<P>piece had struck "eleven with its silver sounds," and the watchman

<P>was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,

<P>before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there
long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in

<P>Camden Place could have passed so well!
