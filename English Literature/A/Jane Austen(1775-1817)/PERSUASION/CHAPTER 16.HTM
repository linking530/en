<P>There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,

<P>would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's

<P>being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being

<P>in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,

<P>when she had been at home a few hours.&nbsp; On going down to breakfast

<P>the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence

<P>on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.&nbsp; She could imagine
Mrs Clay

<P>to have said, that "now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself

<P>at all wanted;" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,

<P>"That must not be any reason, indeed.&nbsp; I assure you I feel it none.

<P>She is nothing to me, compared with you;"&nbsp; and she was in full
time

<P>to hear her father say, "My dear madam, this must not be.&nbsp; As yet,

<P>you have seen nothing of Bath.&nbsp; You have been here only to be useful.

<P>You must not run away from us now.&nbsp; You must stay to be acquainted

<P>with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.&nbsp; To your fine mind,

<P>I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised

<P>to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.

<P>Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;

<P>but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought

<P>in her sister.&nbsp; The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,

<P>and promise to stay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be

<P>alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;

<P>he thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,

<P>her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.&nbsp; Had she been

<P>using any thing in particular?"&nbsp; "No, nothing."&nbsp; "Merely Gowland,"

<P>he supposed.&nbsp; "No, nothing at all."&nbsp; "Ha! he was surprised
at that;"

<P>and added, "certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;

<P>you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,

<P>the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.&nbsp; Mrs Clay
has been

<P>using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.

<P>You see how it has carried away her freckles."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Elizabeth could but have heard this!&nbsp; Such personal praise

<P>might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne

<P>that the freckles were at all lessened.&nbsp; But everything must

<P>take its chance.&nbsp; The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,

<P>if Elizabeth were also to marry.&nbsp; As for herself, she might always

<P>command a home with Lady Russell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial

<P>on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.&nbsp; The sight of
Mrs Clay

<P>in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation

<P>to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in
Bath

<P>who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has

<P>a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,

<P>or more indifferent, towards the others.&nbsp; His manners were

<P>an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found

<P>the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,

<P>as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliot?"

<P>and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable

<P>or estimable man.&nbsp; Everything united in him; good understanding,

<P>correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.

<P>He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,

<P>without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of
fortune,

<P>without display; he judged for himself in everything essential,

<P>without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.

<P>He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits

<P>or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,

<P>with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value

<P>for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of

<P>fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.

<P>She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.&nbsp; Colonel Wallis

<P>said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness

<P>to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent
his

<P>thinking of a second choice.&nbsp; Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot

<P>outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she

<P>and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;

<P>and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell

<P>should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require

<P>more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.

<P>In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,

<P>at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,

<P>and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,

<P>to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process

<P>in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring

<P>in the heyday of youth.&nbsp; Anne presumed, however, still to smile
about it,

<P>and at last to mention "Elizabeth."&nbsp; Lady Russell listened, and
looked,

<P>and made only this cautious reply:-- "Elizabeth! very well;

<P>time will explain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,

<P>felt she must submit to.&nbsp; She could determine nothing at present.

<P>In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit

<P>of such general observance as "Miss Elliot," that any particularity

<P>of attention seemed almost impossible.&nbsp; Mr Elliot, too,

<P>it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.

<P>A little delay on his side might be very excusable.&nbsp; In fact,

<P>Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that

<P>she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;

<P>for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed

<P>so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery

<P>from the awful impression of its being dissolved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However it might end, he was without any question their

<P>pleasantest acquaintance in Bath:&nbsp; she saw nobody equal to him;

<P>and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,

<P>which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more
of,

<P>as herself.&nbsp; They went through the particulars of their first meeting

<P>a great many times.&nbsp; He gave her to understand that he had

<P>looked at her with some earnestness.&nbsp; She knew it well;

<P>and she remembered another person's look also.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They did not always think alike.&nbsp; His value for rank and connexion

<P>she perceived was greater than hers.&nbsp; It was not merely complaisance,

<P>it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly

<P>into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which

<P>she thought unworthy to excite them.&nbsp; The Bath paper one morning

<P>announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,

<P>and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort

<P>of No. --, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples

<P>(in Anne's opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;

<P>and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,

<P>and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.&nbsp; She had hoped

<P>better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,

<P>and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;

<P>a wish that they had more pride; for "our cousins Lady Dalrymple

<P>and Miss Carteret;" "our cousins, the Dalrymples," sounded in her ears

<P>all day long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,

<P>but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties

<P>of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse

<P>by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,

<P>when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's

<P>at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.

<P>No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.&nbsp; The neglect

<P>had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot

<P>died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,

<P>and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend

<P>that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.

<P>How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted

<P>as cousins again, was the question:&nbsp; and it was a question which,

<P>in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot

<P>thought unimportant.&nbsp; "Family connexions were always worth preserving,

<P>good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,

<P>for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.

<P>She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her

<P>spoken of as a charming woman.&nbsp; It was very desirable that

<P>the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any

<P>compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote

<P>a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,

<P>to his right honourable cousin.&nbsp; Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot

<P>could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,

<P>in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.

<P>"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance."

<P>The toils of the business were over, the sweets began.&nbsp; They visited

<P>in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,

<P>and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might

<P>be most visible:&nbsp; and "Our cousins in Laura Place,"--"Our cousin,

<P>Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret," were talked of to everybody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was ashamed.&nbsp; Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been

<P>very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation

<P>they created, but they were nothing.&nbsp; There was no superiority
of manner,

<P>accomplishment, or understanding.&nbsp; Lady Dalrymple had acquired

<P>the name of "a charming woman," because she had a smile and a civil
answer

<P>for everybody.&nbsp; Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain

<P>and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place

<P>but for her birth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet

<P>"it was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anne ventured to speak

<P>her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing

<P>in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,

<P>as good company, as those who would collect good company around them,

<P>they had their value.&nbsp; Anne smiled and said,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,

<P>well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;

<P>that is what I call good company."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are mistaken," said he gently, "that is not good company;

<P>that is the best.&nbsp; Good company requires only birth, education,

<P>and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.

<P>Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is

<P>by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,

<P>it will do very well.&nbsp; My cousin Anne shakes her head.

<P>She is not satisfied.&nbsp; She is fastidious.&nbsp; My dear cousin"

<P>(sitting down by her), "you have a better right to be fastidious

<P>than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?

<P>Will it make you happy?&nbsp; Will it not be wiser to accept the society

<P>of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages

<P>of the connexion as far as possible?&nbsp; You may depend upon it,

<P>that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,

<P>and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them

<P>will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)

<P>in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," sighed Anne, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"

<P>then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,

<P>"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken

<P>to procure the acquaintance.&nbsp; I suppose" (smiling) "I have more
pride

<P>than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be

<P>so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may

<P>be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.

<P>In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,

<P>it might be as you say:&nbsp; but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his
family

<P>will always be worth knowing:&nbsp; always acceptable as acquaintance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Anne, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome

<P>which depends so entirely upon place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural.

<P>But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here

<P>with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter
Elliot.

<P>You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not
wish

<P>to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,

<P>would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem

<P>a little different.&nbsp; In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,"

<P>(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)

<P>"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.&nbsp; We must feel that

<P>every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors,

<P>may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been

<P>lately occupying:&nbsp; a sufficient explanation of what he particularly
meant;

<P>and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,

<P>she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience

<P>admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting

<P>great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating
her.
