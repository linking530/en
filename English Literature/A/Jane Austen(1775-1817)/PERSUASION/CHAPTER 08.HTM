<P>From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly

<P>in the same circle.&nbsp; They were soon dining in company together

<P>at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer

<P>supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was

<P>but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;

<P>former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;

<P>they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement

<P>could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions

<P>which conversation called forth.&nbsp; His profession qualified him,

<P>his disposition lead him, to talk; and "That was in the year six;"

<P>"That happened before I went to sea in the year six," occurred

<P>in the course of the first evening they spent together:

<P>and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason

<P>to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,

<P>Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,

<P>that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.

<P>There must be the same immediate association of thought,

<P>though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what

<P>the commonest civility required.&nbsp; Once so much to each other!

<P>Now nothing!&nbsp; There had been a time, when of all the large party

<P>now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it

<P>most difficult to cease to speak to one another.&nbsp; With the exception,

<P>perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached

<P>and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among

<P>the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,

<P>no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.

<P>Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could

<P>never become acquainted.&nbsp; It was a perpetual estrangement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.

<P>There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the
party;

<P>and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,

<P>who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner

<P>of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &amp;c., and their
surprise

<P>at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement

<P>which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,

<P>which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,

<P>and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board

<P>without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,

<P>or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper

<P>of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,

<P>I dare say he would have been just such another by this time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove

<P>relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,

<P>could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she could let her attention take its natural course again,

<P>she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List

<P>(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),

<P>and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view

<P>of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will not find her there.&nbsp; Quite worn out and broken up.

<P>I was the last man who commanded her.&nbsp; Hardly fit for service then.

<P>Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off

<P>to the West Indies."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girls looked all amazement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Admiralty," he continued, "entertain themselves now and then,

<P>with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.

<P>But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands

<P>that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible

<P>for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Phoo! phoo!" cried the Admiral, "what stuff these young fellows talk!

<P>Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.&nbsp; For an old built
sloop,

<P>you would not see her equal.&nbsp; Lucky fellow to get her!&nbsp; He
knows there

<P>must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her

<P>at the same time.&nbsp; Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,

<P>with no more interest than his."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth,

<P>seriously.&nbsp; "I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you
can desire.

<P>It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;

<P>a very great object, I wanted to be doing something."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure you did.&nbsp; What should a young fellow like you do ashore

<P>for half a year together?&nbsp; If a man had not a wife, he soon wants

<P>to be afloat again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how vexed you must have been

<P>when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;" said he, smiling.

<P>"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to

<P>the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen

<P>lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,

<P>and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.

<P>Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me.&nbsp; She did all that I wanted.

<P>I knew she would.&nbsp; I knew that we should either go to the bottom
together,

<P>or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days

<P>of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after

<P>taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck

<P>in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French
frigate

<P>I wanted.&nbsp; I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance
of luck.

<P>We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,

<P>which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for

<P>poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation

<P>not having much improved our condition.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty hours
later,

<P>and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,

<P>in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost

<P>in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me." Anne's shudderings

<P>were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open

<P>as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so then, I suppose," said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,

<P>as if thinking aloud, "so then he went away to the Laconia, and there

<P>he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear," (beckoning him to her),

<P>"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.

<P>I always forgot."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.&nbsp; Dick had been left ill at
Gibraltar,

<P>with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid

<P>of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure

<P>to hear him talked of by such a good friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,

<P>only nodded in reply, and walked away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth

<P>could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume

<P>into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud

<P>the little statement of her name and rate, and present

<P>non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been

<P>one of the best friends man ever had.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!&nbsp; How fast
I

<P>made money in her.&nbsp; A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise

<P>together off the Western Islands.&nbsp; Poor Harville, sister!

<P>You know how much he wanted money:&nbsp; worse than myself.&nbsp; He
had a wife.

<P>Excellent fellow.&nbsp; I shall never forget his happiness.&nbsp; He
felt it all,

<P>so much for her sake.&nbsp; I wished for him again the next summer,

<P>when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am sure, Sir." said Mrs Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us,

<P>when you were put captain into that ship.&nbsp; We shall never forget

<P>what you did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,

<P>hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all

<P>near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for
more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My brother," whispered one of the girls; "mamma is thinking

<P>of poor Richard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs Musgrove; "he was grown so steady,

<P>and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!

<P>Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.

<P>I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this
speech,

<P>a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,

<P>which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind
wishes,

<P>as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;

<P>but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected

<P>by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment

<P>he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards

<P>coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,

<P>took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,

<P>in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy

<P>and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all

<P>that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had

<P>most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.

<P>It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove was of

<P>a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature

<P>to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;

<P>and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,

<P>may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth

<P>should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which

<P>he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,

<P>whom alive nobody had cared for.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.

<P>A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,

<P>as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.&nbsp; But, fair or not
fair,

<P>there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--

<P>which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room

<P>with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,

<P>now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation

<P>of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,

<P>began with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,

<P>you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson

<P>and her daughters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Should I?&nbsp; I am glad I was not a week later then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.&nbsp; He defended
himself;

<P>though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies

<P>on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,

<P>which a few hours might comprehend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, if I know myself," said he, "this is from no want of gallantry

<P>towards them.&nbsp; It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,

<P>with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make

<P>the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.

<P>There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of
women

<P>to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.&nbsp; I hate
to hear

<P>of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command

<P>shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This brought his sister upon him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! Frederick!&nbsp; But I cannot believe it of you. --All idle refinement!

<P>--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.

<P>I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know

<P>nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.&nbsp; I declare

<P>I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,"

<P>(with a kind bow to Anne), "beyond what I always had in most of

<P>the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing to the purpose," replied her brother.&nbsp; "You were living

<P>with your husband, and were the only woman on board."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,

<P>and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.&nbsp; Where was
this

<P>superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.&nbsp; I would assist any

<P>brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything

<P>of Harville's from the world's end, if he wanted it.&nbsp; But do not
imagine

<P>that I did not feel it an evil in itself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.&nbsp; Such a number

<P>of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.&nbsp; Pray, what would

<P>become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to

<P>one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville

<P>and all her family to Plymouth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,

<P>and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.

<P>We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! my dear," said the Admiral, "when he had got a wife,

<P>he will sing a different tune.&nbsp; When he is married, if we have

<P>the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and
I,

<P>and a great many others, have done.&nbsp; We shall have him very thankful

<P>to anybody that will bring him his wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ay, that we shall."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I have done," cried Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; "When once married

<P>people begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,

<P>when you are married.'&nbsp; I can only say, `No, I shall not;' and
then

<P>they say again, `Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He got up and moved away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove

<P>to Mrs Croft.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;

<P>though many women have done more.&nbsp; I have crossed the Atlantic

<P>four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,

<P>and only once; besides being in different places about home:

<P>Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.&nbsp; But I never went beyond the Streights,

<P>and never was in the West Indies.&nbsp; We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,

<P>you know, the West Indies."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse
herself

<P>of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I do assure you, ma'am," pursued Mrs Croft, "that nothing can exceed

<P>the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher
rates.

<P>When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;

<P>though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;

<P>and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent

<P>on board a ship.&nbsp; While we were together, you know, there was nothing

<P>to be feared.&nbsp; Thank God!&nbsp; I have always been blessed with

<P>excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.&nbsp; A little disordered

<P>always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew

<P>what sickness was afterwards.&nbsp; The only time I ever really suffered

<P>in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,

<P>or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at
Deal,

<P>when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.

<P>I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of

<P>imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,

<P>or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,

<P>nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, to be sure.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, oh yes!&nbsp; I am quite of your
opinion,

<P>Mrs Croft," was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.&nbsp; "There is nothing
so bad

<P>as a separation.&nbsp; I am quite of your opinion.&nbsp; I know what
it is,

<P>for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when

<P>they are over, and he is safe back again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening ended with dancing.&nbsp; On its being proposed,

<P>Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes

<P>fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad

<P>to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits

<P>than Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; She felt that he had every thing to elevate

<P>him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention

<P>of all the young women, could do.&nbsp; The Miss Hayters, the females

<P>of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted

<P>to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,

<P>they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but

<P>the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves

<P>could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.

<P>If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,

<P>who could wonder?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers

<P>were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,

<P>equally without error, and without consciousness.&nbsp; Once she felt

<P>that he was looking at herself,&nbsp; observing her altered features,

<P>perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once

<P>charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;

<P>she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she
was

<P>sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?

<P>The answer was, "Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.

<P>She had rather play.&nbsp; She is never tired of playing."&nbsp; Once,
too,

<P>he spoke to her.&nbsp; She had left the instrument on the dancing being
over,

<P>and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished

<P>to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.&nbsp; Unintentionally she returned

<P>to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,

<P>said, with studied politeness--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;" and though she immediately

<P>drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced

<P>to sit down again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.

<P>His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.
