<P>Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal

<P>from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three
miles,

<P>will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.

<P>She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,

<P>or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage

<P>in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs

<P>which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity

<P>and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed

<P>she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing

<P>our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for
her;

<P>for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject

<P>which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many
weeks,

<P>she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found

<P>in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:

<P>"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of
Bath

<P>do you think they will settle in?" and this, without much

<P>waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of,

<P>"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,

<P>if we do go, we must be in a good situation:&nbsp; none of your

<P>Queen Squares for us!" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--

<P>"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away

<P>to be happy at Bath!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,

<P>and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing

<P>of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,

<P>their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females

<P>were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,

<P>neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.&nbsp; She acknowledged it to
be

<P>very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate

<P>its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become

<P>a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.

<P>With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,

<P>it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,

<P>and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had no dread of these two months.&nbsp; Mary was not so repulsive

<P>and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of
hers;

<P>neither was there anything among the other component parts

<P>of the cottage inimical to comfort.&nbsp; She was always on friendly
terms

<P>with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as
well,

<P>and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had

<P>an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was

<P>undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,

<P>or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,

<P>at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,

<P>Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match

<P>might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding

<P>might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,

<P>rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.&nbsp; As it was,

<P>he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise

<P>trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.

<P>He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by

<P>his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness

<P>sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was

<P>very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share

<P>than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass

<P>for a happy couple.&nbsp; They were always perfectly agreed in the want

<P>of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present

<P>from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,

<P>for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not
made,

<P>he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his
money,

<P>and a right to spend it as he liked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to the management of their children, his theory was much better

<P>than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.&nbsp; "I could manage
them

<P>very well, if it were not for Mary's interference," was what

<P>Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;

<P>but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of "Charles spoils

<P>the children so that I cannot get them into any order," she never had

<P>the smallest temptation to say, "Very true."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there

<P>was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,

<P>and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.

<P>Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,

<P>or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.

<P>"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,"

<P>was Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:

<P>"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think

<P>there was anything the matter with me.&nbsp; I am sure, Anne, if you
would,

<P>you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse

<P>than I ever own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great House,

<P>though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours

<P>and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash

<P>and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross

<P>for the rest of the day."&nbsp; And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity

<P>of being alone with Anne, to say, "Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing

<P>Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.

<P>They are quite different creatures with you!&nbsp; But to be sure,

<P>in general they are so spoilt!&nbsp; It is a pity you cannot put your
sister

<P>in the way of managing them.&nbsp; They are as fine healthy children

<P>as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;

<P>but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!

<P>Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.&nbsp; I assure you, Miss
Anne,

<P>it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as

<P>I otherwise should.&nbsp; I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased

<P>with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad

<P>to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking

<P>every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;"&nbsp; or that one
can

<P>only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.&nbsp; "Mrs Musgrove
thinks

<P>all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason

<P>to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,

<P>that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being

<P>in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.

<P>I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery

<P>without seeing something of them.&nbsp; If Jemima were not the trustiest,

<P>steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;

<P>for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them."

<P>And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering

<P>in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do;

<P>but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things

<P>to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid:

<P>I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from

<P>my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,

<P>that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.

<P>Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,

<P>that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,

<P>you need not be afraid of mentioning it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt

<P>not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined

<P>at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason

<P>why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.

<P>And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them

<P>after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,

<P>"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons
are

<P>about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent

<P>you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that

<P>it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,

<P>especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take

<P>place of mamma.&nbsp; Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of
mamma,

<P>but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.

<P>It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,

<P>but I know it is taken notice of by many persons."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?&nbsp; She could do
little more

<P>than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each

<P>to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary

<P>between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest

<P>which were meant for her sister's benefit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.

<P>Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject,

<P>by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened

<P>by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse

<P>with the other family, since there was neither superior affection,

<P>confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,

<P>was rather an advantage.&nbsp; It was certainly carried nearly as far
as possible,

<P>for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;

<P>but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight

<P>of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places,

<P>or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,

<P>but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,

<P>to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was

<P>little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,

<P>as she was well aware.&nbsp; She knew that when she played she was

<P>giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.

<P>Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age

<P>of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, know the happiness

<P>of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real
taste.

<P>In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;

<P>and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters'

<P>performance, and total indifference to any other person's,

<P>gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification

<P>for her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.

<P>The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited

<P>by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,

<P>more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.

<P>There were more completely popular.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,

<P>in an unpremeditated little ball.&nbsp; There was a family of cousins

<P>within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,

<P>who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:&nbsp; they would
come

<P>at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,

<P>very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,

<P>played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which

<P>always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove

<P>more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--

<P>"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!&nbsp; Lord bless me!

<P>how those little fingers of yours fly about!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So passed the first three weeks.&nbsp; Michaelmas came; and now Anne's
heart

<P>must be in Kellynch again.&nbsp; A beloved home made over to others;

<P>all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,

<P>beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!&nbsp; She could not

<P>think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this

<P>sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion

<P>to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this

<P>the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?&nbsp; I am glad I did not

<P>think of it before.&nbsp; How low it makes me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were

<P>to be visited.&nbsp; Mary deplored the necessity for herself.

<P>"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.&nbsp; She should put it off

<P>as long as she could;" but was not easy till she had talked Charles

<P>into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,

<P>comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.

<P>Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.

<P>She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within

<P>when the visit was returned.&nbsp; They came:&nbsp; the master of the
house

<P>was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced

<P>that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,

<P>and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice

<P>of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,

<P>and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,

<P>or in the turn of sentiment and expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,

<P>uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.

<P>She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;

<P>though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence

<P>of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem
to

<P>have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.

<P>Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had

<P>no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any

<P>approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.

<P>Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration

<P>towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:

<P>especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,

<P>in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest

<P>symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a
bias

<P>of any sort.&nbsp; She was quite easy on that head, and consequently

<P>full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by

<P>Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had

<P>the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion

<P>she certainly had not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?" added Mrs Croft.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,

<P>when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth

<P>of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do

<P>for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,

<P>that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,

<P>and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness

<P>applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's

<P>present state with proper interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,

<P>she heard the Admiral say to Mary--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say

<P>you know him by name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,

<P>clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;

<P>and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away

<P>in his coat pockets, &amp;c., to have another moment for finishing

<P>or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,

<P>as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.

<P>She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,

<P>as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject

<P>at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day

<P>at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits

<P>to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,

<P>when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.&nbsp; That she was coming

<P>to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,

<P>was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,

<P>when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,

<P>to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I will tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it.

<P>I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are

<P>out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much

<P>of poor Richard!&nbsp; And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,

<P>for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.&nbsp; I will tell
you

<P>why she is out of spirits.&nbsp; When the Crofts called this morning,

<P>(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,

<P>that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,

<P>or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;

<P>and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone,

<P>that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of

<P>poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where,

<P>but a great while before he died, poor fellow!&nbsp; And upon looking
over

<P>his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure

<P>that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,

<P>and of poor Richard!&nbsp; So we must be as merry as we can, that she
may not

<P>be dwelling upon such gloomy things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,

<P>that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,

<P>hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached

<P>his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid

<P>and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for

<P>at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;

<P>seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence

<P>of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for
him,

<P>by calling him "poor Richard," been nothing better than a thick-headed,

<P>unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything

<P>to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,

<P>living or dead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals

<P>to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen

<P>as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board

<P>Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia

<P>he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters

<P>which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole

<P>of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;

<P>all the rest had been mere applications for money.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,

<P>so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,

<P>so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,

<P>that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove

<P>should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection

<P>of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those

<P>extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;

<P>and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,

<P>her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,

<P>had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into

<P>greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.

<P>Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when

<P>they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,

<P>of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,

<P>of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name

<P>so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it
might,

<P>that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth

<P>whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back

<P>from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether

<P>it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.

<P>She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.

<P>Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself

<P>to be insensible on such points.&nbsp; And not only did it appear that

<P>he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude

<P>for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect

<P>for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been

<P>six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,

<P>though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as "a fine dashing felow,

<P>only two perticular about the schoolmaster," were bent on

<P>introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as

<P>they could hear of his arrival.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.
