<P>One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith;

<P>but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched

<P>by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,

<P>that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer

<P>her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.&nbsp; She had promised to be

<P>with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.&nbsp; Her faith was plighted,

<P>and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head,

<P>must live another day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not keep her appointment punctually, however;

<P>the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain

<P>on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own,

<P>before she was able to attempt the walk.&nbsp; When she reached the
White Hart,

<P>and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself

<P>neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.

<P>The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,

<P>and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard

<P>that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment

<P>it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest

<P>injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there

<P>till they returned.&nbsp; She had only to submit, sit down,

<P>be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once

<P>in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of

<P>tasting a little before the morning closed.&nbsp; There was no delay,

<P>no waste of time.&nbsp; She was deep in the happiness of such misery,

<P>or the misery of such happiness, instantly.&nbsp; Two minutes after

<P>her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,

<P>if you will give me materials."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,

<P>and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest

<P>daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice

<P>which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.

<P>Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,

<P>as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,

<P>she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,

<P>"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again

<P>to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,

<P>and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred

<P>to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what

<P>I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded

<P>to think might do very well," and a great deal in the same style

<P>of open-hearted communication:&nbsp; minutiae which, even with every
advantage

<P>of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,

<P>could be properly interesting only to the principals.&nbsp; Mrs Croft

<P>was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,

<P>it was very sensibly.&nbsp; Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be

<P>too much self-occupied to hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered," said Mrs Musgrove,

<P>in her powerful whisper, "though we could have wished it different,

<P>yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,

<P>for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was

<P>pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,

<P>and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.

<P>At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is precisely what I was going to observe," cried Mrs Croft.

<P>"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,

<P>and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be

<P>involved in a long engagement.&nbsp; I always think that no mutual--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! dear Mrs Croft," cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her

<P>finish her speech, "there is nothing I so abominate for young people

<P>as a long engagement.&nbsp; It is what I always protested against

<P>for my children.&nbsp; It is all very well, I used to say, for young
people

<P>to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry

<P>in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, dear ma'am," said Mrs Croft, "or an uncertain engagement,

<P>an engagement which may be long.&nbsp; To begin without knowing

<P>that at such a time there will be the means of marrying,

<P>I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents

<P>should prevent as far as they can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne found an unexpected interest here.&nbsp; She felt its application

<P>to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same

<P>moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,

<P>Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,

<P>listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,

<P>one quick, conscious look at her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,

<P>and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of

<P>a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,

<P>but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her
ear,

<P>her mind was in confusion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,

<P>now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch
him,

<P>though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible

<P>that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.&nbsp; He looked
at her

<P>with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,

<P>"Come to me, I have something to say;" and the unaffected,

<P>easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance

<P>than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.&nbsp; She roused
herself

<P>and went to him.&nbsp; The window at which he stood was at the other
end

<P>of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer

<P>to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near.&nbsp; As she joined him,

<P>Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful

<P>expression which seemed its natural character.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look here," said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying

<P>a small miniature painting, "do you know who that is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly:&nbsp; Captain Benwick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.&nbsp; But," (in a deep tone,)

<P>"it was not done for her.&nbsp; Miss Elliot, do you remember our

<P>walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?&nbsp; I little thought
then--

<P>but no matter.&nbsp; This was drawn at the Cape.&nbsp; He met with

<P>a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise

<P>to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;

<P>and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!

<P>It was a commission to me!&nbsp; But who else was there to employ?

<P>I hope I can allow for him.&nbsp; I am not sorry, indeed, to make it

<P>over to another.&nbsp; He undertakes it;" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)

<P>"he is writing about it now."&nbsp; And with a quivering lip he wound
up

<P>the whole by adding, "Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so
soon!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. "That I can easily believe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was not in her nature.&nbsp; She doted on him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Do you claim that

<P>for your sex?" and she answered the question, smiling also,

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.

<P>It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.&nbsp; We cannot help
ourselves.

<P>We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.

<P>You are forced on exertion.&nbsp; You have always a profession, pursuits,

<P>business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,

<P>and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men

<P>(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply

<P>to Benwick.&nbsp; He has not been forced upon any exertion.&nbsp; The
peace

<P>turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with
us,

<P>in our little family circle, ever since."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True," said Anne, "very true; I did not recollect; but what shall

<P>we say now, Captain Harville?&nbsp; If the change be not from

<P>outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,

<P>man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, it is not man's nature.&nbsp; I will not allow it to be more

<P>man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do
love,

<P>or have loved.&nbsp; I believe the reverse.&nbsp; I believe in a true
analogy

<P>between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are

<P>the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,

<P>and riding out the heaviest weather."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied Anne, "but the same spirit

<P>of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.

<P>Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;

<P>which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.

<P>Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.

<P>You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle
with.

<P>You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.

<P>Your home, country, friends, all quitted.&nbsp; Neither time, nor health,

<P>nor life, to be called your own.&nbsp; It would be hard, indeed"

<P>(with a faltering voice), "if woman's feelings were to be

<P>added to all this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We shall never agree upon this question," Captain Harville

<P>was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention

<P>to Captain Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.

<P>It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was

<P>startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined

<P>to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been

<P>occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think

<P>he could have caught.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you finished your letter?" said Captain Harville.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not quite, a few lines more.&nbsp; I shall have done in five minutes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no hurry on my side.&nbsp; I am only ready whenever you are.

<P>I am in very good anchorage here," (smiling at Anne,) "well supplied,

<P>and want for nothing.&nbsp; No hurry for a signal at all.&nbsp; Well,
Miss Elliot,"

<P>(lowering his voice,) "as I was saying we shall never agree,

<P>I suppose, upon this point.&nbsp; No man and woman, would, probably.

<P>But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,

<P>prose and verse.&nbsp; If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring
you

<P>fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think

<P>I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say

<P>upon woman's inconstancy.&nbsp; Songs and proverbs, all talk

<P>of woman's fickleness.&nbsp; But perhaps you will say, these were all

<P>written by men."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps I shall.&nbsp; Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples

<P>in books.&nbsp; Men have had every advantage of us in telling their
own story.

<P>Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has

<P>been in their hands.&nbsp; I will not allow books to prove anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But how shall we prove anything?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We never shall.&nbsp; We never can expect to prove any thing upon such
a point.

<P>It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.

<P>We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;

<P>and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it

<P>which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances

<P>(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely
such

<P>as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,

<P>or in some respect saying what should not be said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,

<P>"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes

<P>a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat

<P>that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,

<P>and then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!'

<P>And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does

<P>see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence,

<P>perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon

<P>it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,

<P>and saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while

<P>hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,

<P>as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!

<P>If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and
do,

<P>and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!

<P>I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!" pressing his own

<P>with emotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" cried Anne eagerly, "I hope I do justice to all that is felt by
you,

<P>and by those who resemble you.&nbsp; God forbid that I should undervalue

<P>the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!

<P>I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment

<P>and constancy were known only by woman.&nbsp; No, I believe you capable

<P>of everything great and good in your married lives.&nbsp; I believe
you equal

<P>to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,

<P>so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have

<P>an object.&nbsp; I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for
you.

<P>All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable
one;

<P>you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence

<P>or when hope is gone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart

<P>was too full, her breath too much oppressed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting his hand

<P>on her arm, quite affectionately.&nbsp; "There is no quarreling with
you.

<P>And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their attention was called towards the others.&nbsp; Mrs Croft was taking
leave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe," said she.

<P>"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.

<P>To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,"

<P>(turning to Anne.)&nbsp; "We had your sister's card yesterday,

<P>and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;

<P>and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either

<P>could not or would not answer fully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said he, "very true; here we separate, but Harville and I

<P>shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,

<P>I am in half a minute.&nbsp; I know you will not be sorry to be off.

<P>I shall be at your service in half a minute."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter

<P>with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,

<P>agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.&nbsp; Anne know not
how

<P>to understand it.&nbsp; She had the kindest "Good morning, God bless
you!"

<P>from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!

<P>He had passed out of the room without a look!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where

<P>he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;

<P>the door opened, it was himself.&nbsp; He begged their pardon,

<P>but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room

<P>to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered
paper,

<P>placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her

<P>for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the
room,

<P>almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:

<P>the work of an instant!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost

<P>beyond expression.&nbsp; The letter, with a direction hardly legible,

<P>to "Miss A. E.--," was evidently the one which he had been folding

<P>so hastily.&nbsp; While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,

<P>he had been also addressing her!&nbsp; On the contents of that letter

<P>depended all which this world could do for her.&nbsp; Anything was possible,

<P>anything might be defied rather than suspense.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove had

<P>little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection

<P>she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,

<P>succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,

<P>her eyes devoured the following words:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can listen no longer in silence.&nbsp; I must speak to you by such
means

<P>as are within my reach.&nbsp; You pierce my soul.&nbsp; I am half agony,

<P>half hope.&nbsp; Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious
feelings

<P>are gone for ever.&nbsp; I offer myself to you again with a heart

<P>even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years

<P>and a half ago.&nbsp; Dare not say that man forgets sooner than&nbsp;
woman,

<P>that his love has an earlier death.&nbsp; I have loved none but you.

<P>Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,

<P>but never inconstant.&nbsp; You alone have brought me to Bath.

<P>For you alone, I think and plan.&nbsp; Have you not seen this?

<P>Can you fail to have understood my wishes?&nbsp; I had not waited even

<P>these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must
have

<P>penetrated mine.&nbsp; I can hardly write.&nbsp; I am every instant
hearing

<P>something which overpowers me.&nbsp; You sink your voice, but I can

<P>distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.

<P>Too good, too excellent creature!&nbsp; You do us justice, indeed.

<P>You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.

<P>Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,

<P>or follow your party, as soon as possible.&nbsp; A word, a look,

<P>will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house

<P>this evening or never."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.&nbsp; Half and hour's
solitude

<P>and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only

<P>which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints

<P>of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.&nbsp; Every
moment

<P>rather brought fresh agitation.&nbsp; It was overpowering happiness.

<P>And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,

<P>Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then

<P>an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.

<P>She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged

<P>to plead indisposition and excuse herself.&nbsp; They could then see

<P>that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not

<P>stir without her for the world.&nbsp; This was dreadful.&nbsp; Would
they only

<P>have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room

<P>it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or

<P>waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,

<P>she said she would go home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By all means, my dear," cried Mrs Musgrove, "go home directly,

<P>and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.

<P>I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.

<P>Charles, ring and order a chair.&nbsp; She must not walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the chair would never do.&nbsp; Worse than all!&nbsp; To lose the
possibility

<P>of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,

<P>solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting
him)

<P>could not be borne.&nbsp; The chair was earnestly protested against,

<P>and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,

<P>having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall

<P>in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,

<P>and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having

<P>had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on

<P>finding her better at night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.

<P>Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope

<P>to see your whole party this evening.&nbsp; I am afraid there had been

<P>some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville

<P>and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.

<P>Captain Harville has no thought but of going."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think so?&nbsp; But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.

<P>Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?

<P>You will see them both this morning, I dare say.&nbsp; Do promise me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure I will, if you wish it.&nbsp; Charles, if you see Captain
Harville

<P>anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.&nbsp; But indeed, my
dear,

<P>you need not be uneasy.&nbsp; Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,

<P>I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance

<P>to damp the perfection of her felicity.&nbsp; It could not be very lasting,

<P>however.&nbsp; Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,

<P>it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence

<P>by Captain Harville.&nbsp; Another momentary vexation occurred.

<P>Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;

<P>there was no preventing him.&nbsp; This was almost cruel.&nbsp; But
she could not

<P>be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's,

<P>to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling

<P>but gratitude apparent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something

<P>of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight

<P>of Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; He joined them; but, as if irresolute

<P>whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.

<P>Anne could command herself enough to receive that look,

<P>and not repulsively.&nbsp; The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,

<P>and the movements which had hesitated were decided.&nbsp; He walked
by her side.

<P>Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?&nbsp; Only to Gay Street,

<P>or farther up the town?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hardly know," replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you going as high as Belmont?&nbsp; Are you going near Camden Place?

<P>Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you

<P>to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.

<P>She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without
help,

<P>and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place.

<P>He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;

<P>said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,

<P>that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.

<P>By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of
mine,

<P>which you shot with one day round Winthrop."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There could not be an objection.&nbsp; There could be only the most

<P>proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;

<P>and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.

<P>In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,

<P>and the other two proceeding together:&nbsp; and soon words enough had
passed

<P>between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet

<P>and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make

<P>the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all

<P>the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future
lives

<P>could bestow.&nbsp; There they exchanged again those feelings

<P>and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,

<P>but which had been followed by so many, many years of division

<P>and estrangement.&nbsp; There they returned again into the past,

<P>more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when

<P>it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed

<P>in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment;

<P>more equal to act, more justified in acting.&nbsp; And there, as they
slowly

<P>paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,

<P>seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,

<P>flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in

<P>those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in

<P>those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,

<P>which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.&nbsp; All the little

<P>variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday

<P>and today there could scarcely be an end.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had not mistaken him.&nbsp; Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been

<P>the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.&nbsp; That had begun to
operate

<P>in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,

<P>after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced
him

<P>in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,

<P>in the last four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp; It had been gradually yielding

<P>to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions

<P>occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by

<P>those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked

<P>with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which

<P>he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.

<P>He persisted in having loved none but her.&nbsp; She had never been
supplanted.

<P>He never even believed himself to see her equal.&nbsp; Thus much indeed

<P>he was obliged to acknowledge:&nbsp; that he had been constant unconsciously,

<P>nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it

<P>to be done.&nbsp; He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only

<P>been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been

<P>a sufferer from them.&nbsp; Her character was now fixed on his mind

<P>as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude

<P>and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross

<P>had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun

<P>to understand himself.&nbsp; At Lyme, he had received lessons

<P>of more than one sort.&nbsp; The passing admiration of Mr Elliot

<P>had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at

<P>Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove

<P>(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever

<P>felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,

<P>for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection

<P>which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence

<P>of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison,

<P>or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.

<P>There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle

<P>and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness

<P>and the resolution of a collected mind.&nbsp; There he had seen everything

<P>to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun

<P>to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,

<P>which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From that period his penance had become severe.&nbsp; He had no sooner

<P>been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days

<P>of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,

<P>than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I found," said he, "that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!

<P>That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our

<P>mutual attachment.&nbsp; I was startled and shocked.&nbsp; To a degree,

<P>I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect

<P>that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,

<P>perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.&nbsp; I was hers
in honour

<P>if she wished it.&nbsp; I had been unguarded.&nbsp; I had not thought
seriously

<P>on this subject before.&nbsp; I had not considered that my excessive
intimacy

<P>must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had

<P>no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the
girls,

<P>at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other

<P>ill effects.&nbsp; I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;

<P>and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring

<P>for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,

<P>if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.

<P>It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.

<P>He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or

<P>speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,

<P>to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,

<P>and act as circumstances might require.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was six weeks with Edward," said he, "and saw him happy.

<P>I could have no other pleasure.&nbsp; I deserved none.&nbsp; He enquired
after you

<P>very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,

<P>little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne smiled, and let it pass.&nbsp; It was too pleasing a blunder

<P>for a reproach.&nbsp; It is something for a woman to be assured,

<P>in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm

<P>of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased

<P>to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be

<P>the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,

<P>and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from
Louisa

<P>by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement

<P>with Benwick.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here," said he, "ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least

<P>put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;

<P>I could do something.&nbsp; But to be waiting so long in inaction,

<P>and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.&nbsp; Within the first

<P>five minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.

<P>Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive

<P>with some degree of hope?&nbsp; You were single.&nbsp; It was possible
that

<P>you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement

<P>happened to be mine.&nbsp; I could never doubt that you would be loved
and

<P>sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one
man,

<P>at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help

<P>often saying, `Was this for me?'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,

<P>but the concert still more.&nbsp; That evening seemed to be made up

<P>of exquisite moments.&nbsp; The moment of her stepping forward

<P>in the Octagon Room to speak to him:&nbsp; the moment of Mr Elliot's
appearing

<P>and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,

<P>marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on

<P>with energy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To see you," cried he, "in the midst of those who could not be

<P>my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,

<P>and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!

<P>To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope

<P>to influence you!&nbsp; Even if your own feelings were reluctant or
indifferent,

<P>to consider what powerful supports would be his!&nbsp; Was it not enough

<P>to make the fool of me which I appeared?&nbsp; How could I look on

<P>without agony?&nbsp; Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind
you,

<P>was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,

<P>the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--

<P>was it not all against me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You should have distinguished," replied Anne.&nbsp; "You should not
have

<P>suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.

<P>If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that

<P>it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.

<P>When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called

<P>in aid here.&nbsp; In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk

<P>would have been incurred, and all duty violated."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus," he replied, "but I could not.

<P>I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired

<P>of your character.&nbsp; I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,

<P>buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under

<P>year after year.&nbsp; I could think of you only as one who had yielded,

<P>who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than
by me.

<P>I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.

<P>I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.&nbsp; The force
of habit

<P>was to be added."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should have thought," said Anne, "that my manner to yourself

<P>might have spared you much or all of this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement

<P>to another man would give.&nbsp; I left you in this belief; and yet,

<P>I was determined to see you again.&nbsp; My spirits rallied with the
morning,

<P>and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house

<P>could have conceived.&nbsp; All the surprise and suspense, and every
other

<P>painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,

<P>she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy

<P>in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.

<P>An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective

<P>of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went

<P>to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness

<P>of her enjoyment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.
<BR>It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had

<P>never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,

<P>too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never
found

<P>an evening shorter.&nbsp; Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,

<P>and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,

<P>she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.
<BR>The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.&nbsp; Lady Dalrymple

<P>and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.
<BR>She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in

<P>the public manners of her father and sister.&nbsp; With the Musgroves,

<P>there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,

<P>the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,

<P>attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;

<P>with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and

<P>fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;

<P>and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications

<P>continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always

<P>the knowledge of his being there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied

<P>in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially

<P>to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;

<P>and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,

<P>that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom

<P>you will love better than you do now.&nbsp; To me, she was in the place

<P>of a parent.&nbsp; Do not mistake me, however.&nbsp; I am not saying

<P>that she did not err in her advice.&nbsp; It was, perhaps, one of those
cases

<P>in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;

<P>and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance

<P>of tolerable similarity, give such advice.&nbsp; But I mean, that I
was right

<P>in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have

<P>suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving
it up,

<P>because I should have suffered in my conscience.&nbsp; I have now,

<P>as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing

<P>to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty

<P>is no bad part of a woman's portion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,

<P>replied, as if in cool deliberation--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not yet.&nbsp; But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.
<BR>I trust to being in charity with her soon.&nbsp; But I too have been

<P>thinking over the past, and a&nbsp; question has suggested itself,

<P>whether there may not have been one person more my enemy

<P>even than that lady?&nbsp; My own self.&nbsp; Tell me if, when I returned

<P>to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,

<P>and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,

<P>would you have answered my letter?&nbsp; Would you, in short,

<P>have renewed the engagement then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Would I!" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good God!" he cried, "you would!&nbsp; It is not that I did not think
of it,

<P>or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;

<P>but I was proud, too proud to ask again.&nbsp; I did not understand
you.
<BR>I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.
<BR>This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one

<P>sooner than myself.&nbsp; Six years of separation and suffering

<P>might have been spared.&nbsp; It is a sort of pain, too, which is new
to me.
<BR>I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn

<P>every blessing that I enjoyed.&nbsp; I have valued myself on honourable
toils

<P>and just rewards.&nbsp; Like other great men under reverses," he added,

<P>with a smile. "I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.
<BR>I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve."
