<P>Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest

<P>of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple

<P>must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires

<P>in the Octagon Room.&nbsp; But hardly were they so settled, when the
door

<P>opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.&nbsp; Anne was

<P>the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.

<P>He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle "How do you
do?"

<P>brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries

<P>in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back
ground.

<P>Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing

<P>of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed

<P>right to be done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth

<P>caught her ear.&nbsp; She could not distinguish, but she must guess
the subject;

<P>and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended

<P>that her father had judged so well as to give him that

<P>simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time

<P>by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.

<P>This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet

<P>better than nothing, and her spirits improved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,

<P>their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,

<P>that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;

<P>he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,

<P>with a little smile, a little glow, he said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.&nbsp; I am afraid you
must have

<P>suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you

<P>at the time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She assured him that she had not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was a frightful hour," said he, "a frightful day!" and he

<P>passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still

<P>too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,

<P>"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences

<P>which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.

<P>When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be

<P>the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea

<P>of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly I could have none.&nbsp; But it appears--I should hope it
would be

<P>a very happy match.&nbsp; There are on both sides good principles

<P>and good temper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said he, looking not exactly forward; "but there, I think,

<P>ends the resemblance.&nbsp; With all my soul I wish them happy, and
rejoice

<P>over every circumstance in favour of it.&nbsp; They have no difficulties

<P>to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.

<P>The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,

<P>only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort.

<P>All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;

<P>more than perhaps--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopped.&nbsp; A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give
him

<P>some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks

<P>and fixing her eyes on the ground.&nbsp; After clearing his throat,
however,

<P>he proceeded thus--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,

<P>and in a point no less essential than mind.&nbsp; I regard Louisa Musgrove

<P>as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,

<P>but Benwick is something more.&nbsp; He is a clever man, a reading man;

<P>and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her

<P>with some surprise.&nbsp; Had it been the effect of gratitude,

<P>had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring
him,

<P>it would have been another thing.&nbsp; But I have no reason to suppose
it so.

<P>It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,

<P>untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.&nbsp; A man like
him,

<P>in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!

<P>Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her

<P>was indeed attachment.&nbsp; A man does not recover from such

<P>a devotion of the heart to such a woman.&nbsp; He ought not; he does
not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,

<P>or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,

<P>in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,

<P>and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless

<P>slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,

<P>had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,

<P>and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things

<P>in a moment.&nbsp; It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;

<P>and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,

<P>and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated

<P>so far as to say--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"About a fortnight.&nbsp; I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well

<P>was quite ascertained.&nbsp; I had been too deeply concerned in the
mischief

<P>to be soon at peace.&nbsp; It had been my doing, solely mine.

<P>She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.

<P>The country round Lyme is very fine.&nbsp; I walked and rode a great
deal;

<P>and the more I saw, the more I found to admire."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should very much like to see Lyme again," said Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!&nbsp; I should not have supposed that you could have found

<P>anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.&nbsp; The horror and distress

<P>you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!

<P>I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been

<P>strong disgust."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The last hours were certainly very painful," replied Anne;

<P>"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.

<P>One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,

<P>unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was

<P>by no means the case at Lyme.&nbsp; We were only in anxiety and distress

<P>during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal

<P>of enjoyment.&nbsp; So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so
little,

<P>that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real
beauty

<P>at Lyme; and in short" (with a faint blush at some recollections),

<P>"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared

<P>for whom they were waiting.&nbsp; "Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,"

<P>was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible

<P>with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward

<P>to meet her.&nbsp; Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr
Elliot

<P>and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,

<P>advanced into the room.&nbsp; The others joined them, and it was

<P>a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.

<P>She was divided from Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Their interesting,

<P>almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,

<P>but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought
it on!

<P>She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings

<P>towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;

<P>and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful

<P>civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.

<P>She was in good humour with all.&nbsp; She had received ideas which

<P>disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,

<P>as being less happy than herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back

<P>from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw

<P>that he was gone.&nbsp; She was just in time to see him turn into

<P>the Concert Room.&nbsp; He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt

<P>a moment's regret.&nbsp; But "they should meet again.&nbsp; He would
look for her,

<P>he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,

<P>perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.&nbsp; She was in need of

<P>a little interval for recollection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party

<P>was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,

<P>and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence

<P>in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,

<P>and disturb as many people as they could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked
in.

<P>Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back

<P>of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish
for

<P>which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be

<P>an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison

<P>between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity,

<P>of the other all generous attachment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.

<P>Her happiness was from within.&nbsp; Her eyes were bright and her cheeks
glowed;

<P>but she knew nothing about it.&nbsp; She was thinking only of

<P>the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took

<P>a hasty range over it.&nbsp; His choice of subjects, his expressions,

<P>and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see

<P>in only one light.&nbsp; His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority,

<P>an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder

<P>at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;

<P>sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes

<P>and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had

<P>a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,

<P>were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship

<P>and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.&nbsp; Yes, some share
of

<P>the tenderness of the past.&nbsp; She could not contemplate the change

<P>as implying less.&nbsp; He must love her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied

<P>and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;

<P>and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,

<P>without even trying to discern him.&nbsp; When their places were determined
on,

<P>and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see

<P>if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;

<P>her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,

<P>she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:

<P>Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so
well,

<P>with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat
by her.

<P>Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object

<P>of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment

<P>of the evening; it was just occupation enough:&nbsp; she had feelings
for

<P>the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,

<P>and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,

<P>at least during the first act.&nbsp; Towards the close of it,

<P>in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained

<P>the words of the song to Mr Elliot.&nbsp; They had a concert bill between
them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This," said she, "is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the
words,

<P>for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,

<P>but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend

<P>to understand the language.&nbsp; I am a very poor Italian scholar."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, I see you are.&nbsp; I see you know nothing of the matter.

<P>You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight

<P>these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,

<P>comprehensible, elegant English.&nbsp; You need not say anything more

<P>of your ignorance.&nbsp; Here is complete proof."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be

<P>examined by a real proficient."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,"

<P>replied he, "without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;

<P>and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general

<P>to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished

<P>for modesty to be natural in any other woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.&nbsp; I forget what
we are

<P>to have next," turning to the bill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps," said Mr Elliot, speaking low, "I have had a longer acquaintance

<P>with your character than you are aware of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!&nbsp; How so?&nbsp; You can have been acquainted with it only
since

<P>I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of

<P>in my own family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.&nbsp; I had heard
you

<P>described by those who knew you intimately.&nbsp; I have been acquainted

<P>with you by character many years.&nbsp; Your person, your disposition,

<P>accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.

<P>No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.&nbsp; To have been

<P>described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,

<P>is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.&nbsp; She wondered,

<P>and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.&nbsp; He delighted in being
asked,

<P>but he would not tell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.&nbsp; He would mention

<P>no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.

<P>He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot

<P>as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited

<P>the warmest curiosity to know her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with

<P>partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,

<P>Captain Wentworth's brother.&nbsp; He might have been in Mr Elliot's
company,

<P>but she had not courage to ask the question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The name of Anne Elliot," said he, "has long had an interesting sound
to me.

<P>Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,

<P>I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she

<P>received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds

<P>immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.

<P>Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A well-looking man," said Sir Walter, "a very well-looking man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A very fine young man indeed!" said Lady Dalrymple.&nbsp; "More air

<P>than one often sees in Bath.&nbsp; Irish, I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I just know his name.&nbsp; A bowing acquaintance.&nbsp; Wentworth;

<P>Captain Wentworth of the navy.&nbsp; His sister married my tenant

<P>in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught

<P>the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing

<P>among a cluster of men at a little distance.&nbsp; As her eyes fell
on him,

<P>his seemed to be withdrawn from her.&nbsp; It had that appearance.

<P>It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she

<P>dared observe, he did not look again:&nbsp; but the performance

<P>was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention

<P>to the orchestra and look straight forward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she could give another glance, he had moved away.&nbsp; He could
not have

<P>come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:

<P>but she would rather have caught his eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.&nbsp; She had no longer

<P>any inclination to talk to him.&nbsp; She wished him not so near her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first act was over.&nbsp; Now she hoped for some beneficial change;

<P>and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them

<P>did decide on going in quest of tea.&nbsp; Anne was one of the few who

<P>did not choose to move.&nbsp; She remained in her seat, and so did Lady
Russell;

<P>but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not
mean,

<P>whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from

<P>conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.

<P>She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not come however.&nbsp; Anne sometimes fancied she discerned
him

<P>at a distance, but he never came.&nbsp; The anxious interval

<P>wore away unproductively.&nbsp; The others returned, the room filled
again,

<P>benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure

<P>or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give

<P>delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.

<P>To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.

<P>She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth

<P>once more, without the interchange of one friendly look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of
which

<P>was favourable for her.&nbsp; Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,

<P>and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner

<P>not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,

<P>and a little scheming of her own,&nbsp; Anne was enabled to place herself

<P>much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,

<P>much more within reach of a passer-by.&nbsp; She could not do so,

<P>without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;

<P>but still she did it, and not with much happier effect;

<P>though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication

<P>in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench

<P>before the concert closed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth

<P>was again in sight.&nbsp; She saw him not far off.&nbsp; He saw her
too;

<P>yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees

<P>came at last near enough to speak to her.&nbsp; She felt that something

<P>must be the matter.&nbsp; The change was indubitable.&nbsp; The difference

<P>between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room

<P>was strikingly great.&nbsp; Why was it?&nbsp; She thought of her father,

<P>of Lady Russell.&nbsp; Could there have been any unpleasant glances?

<P>He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain

<P>Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;

<P>and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.

<P>Anne replied, and spoke in defense of the performance so well,

<P>and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance

<P>improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.&nbsp; They talked

<P>for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down

<P>towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;

<P>when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.

<P>It came from Mr Elliot.&nbsp; He begged her pardon, but she must be
applied to,

<P>to explain Italian again.&nbsp; Miss Carteret was very anxious to have

<P>a general idea of what was next to be sung.&nbsp; Anne could not refuse;

<P>but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;

<P>and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look

<P>as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,

<P>in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.&nbsp; "He must wish her
good night;

<P>he was going; he should get home as fast as he could."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is not this song worth staying for?" said Anne, suddenly struck

<P>by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No!" he replied impressively, "there is nothing worth my staying for;"

<P>and he was gone directly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jealousy of Mr Elliot!&nbsp; It was the only intelligible motive.

<P>Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!&nbsp; Could she have believed
it

<P>a week ago; three hours ago!&nbsp; For a moment the gratification was
exquisite.

<P>But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.

<P>How was such jealousy to be quieted?&nbsp; How was the truth to reach
him?

<P>How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,

<P>would he ever learn of her real sentiments?&nbsp; It was misery to think

<P>of Mr Elliot's attentions.&nbsp; Their evil was incalculable.
