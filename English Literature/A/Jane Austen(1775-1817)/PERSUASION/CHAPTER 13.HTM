<P>The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,

<P>was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction

<P>of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,

<P>and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,

<P>in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have

<P>been difficulties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.&nbsp; Louisa was

<P>much the same.&nbsp; No symptoms worse than before had appeared.

<P>Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and

<P>more particular account.&nbsp; He was tolerably cheerful.&nbsp; A speedy
cure

<P>must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well

<P>as the nature of the case admitted.&nbsp; In speaking of the Harvilles,

<P>he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,

<P>especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.&nbsp; "She really
left

<P>nothing for Mary to do.&nbsp; He and Mary had been persuaded to go early

<P>to their inn last night.&nbsp; Mary had been hysterical again this morning.

<P>When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,

<P>which, he hoped, would do her good.&nbsp; He almost wished she had been

<P>prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,

<P>that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father

<P>had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.

<P>It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,

<P>and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed

<P>and was acted upon.&nbsp; A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,

<P>and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid

<P>of the family, one who having brought up all the children,

<P>and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,

<P>sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery

<P>to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could

<P>get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being

<P>allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.&nbsp; Vague wishes of

<P>getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;

<P>but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,

<P>and found practicable so soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all

<P>the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain

<P>every twenty-four hours.&nbsp; He made it his business to go to Lyme,

<P>and his account was still encouraging.&nbsp; The intervals of sense

<P>and consciousness were believed to be stronger.&nbsp; Every report agreed

<P>in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.

<P>"What should they do without her?&nbsp; They were wretched comforters

<P>for one another."&nbsp; And so much was said in this way, that Anne
thought

<P>she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination

<P>to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.

<P>She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;

<P>go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,

<P>as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.

<P>They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;

<P>they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;

<P>and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted

<P>with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her

<P>last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,

<P>and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left

<P>to the solitary range of the house was the consequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,

<P>she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled

<P>and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross

<P>its cheerful character.&nbsp; A few days had made a change indeed!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.&nbsp; More than

<P>former happiness would be restored.&nbsp; There could not be a doubt,

<P>to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.

<P>A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by

<P>her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy

<P>and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,

<P>all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these,

<P>on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out

<P>the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough

<P>to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome;

<P>and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion
House,

<P>or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and

<P>comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses

<P>the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.

<P>Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.

<P>It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,

<P>but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,

<P>some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could

<P>never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.

<P>She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that

<P>such things had been.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house

<P>in September.&nbsp; It had not been necessary, and the few occasions
of

<P>its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade

<P>and escape from.&nbsp; Her first return was to resume her place in the
modern

<P>and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes

<P>of its mistress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.

<P>She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.&nbsp; But happily,

<P>either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell

<P>fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,

<P>had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration

<P>of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with

<P>a second spring of youth and beauty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.

<P>The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,

<P>and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother

<P>among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.

<P>She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.

<P>Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;

<P>and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,

<P>and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,

<P>which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still

<P>be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known

<P>how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,

<P>and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her

<P>was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,

<P>than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy

<P>with Mrs Clay.&nbsp; She was actually forced to exert herself

<P>to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,

<P>on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse

<P>on another subject.&nbsp; They must speak of the accident at Lyme.

<P>Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,

<P>when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must

<P>be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,

<P>lament the result, and Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by
both.

<P>Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.

<P>She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to

<P>Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her

<P>briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.

<P>When this was told, his name distressed her no longer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,

<P>but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,

<P>that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat

<P>of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,

<P>be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance

<P>to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,

<P>which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought

<P>a rather improving account of Louisa.&nbsp; At the end of that period,

<P>Lady Russell's politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter

<P>self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,

<P>"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.

<P>Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?

<P>It will be some trial to us both."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she
said,

<P>in observing--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;

<P>your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.

<P>By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact

<P>so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father

<P>so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure

<P>of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,

<P>that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,

<P>she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone

<P>who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed

<P>into better hands than its owners'.&nbsp; These convictions must unquestionably

<P>have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded

<P>that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,

<P>and returning through the well-known apartments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,

<P>"These rooms ought to belong only to us.&nbsp; Oh, how fallen

<P>in their destination!&nbsp; How unworthily occupied!&nbsp; An ancient
family

<P>to be so driven away!&nbsp; Strangers filling their place!"

<P>No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where

<P>she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description

<P>to heave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure

<P>of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,

<P>receiving her in that house, there was particular attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,

<P>and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared

<P>that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;

<P>that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time

<P>since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had

<P>not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours

<P>and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention

<P>of quitting it any more.&nbsp; He had enquired after her, she found,

<P>particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being

<P>the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.

<P>This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else

<P>could have done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one
style

<P>by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work

<P>on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been

<P>the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;

<P>that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,

<P>how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable

<P>she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!

<P>The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ay, a very bad business indeed.&nbsp; A new sort of way this,

<P>for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head,

<P>is not it, Miss Elliot?&nbsp; This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,

<P>truly!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,

<P>but they delighted Anne.&nbsp; His goodness of heart and simplicity

<P>of character were irresistible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, this must be very bad for you," said he, suddenly rousing from

<P>a little reverie, "to be coming and finding us here.&nbsp; I had not

<P>recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.

<P>But now, do not stand upon ceremony.&nbsp; Get up and go over all the
rooms

<P>in the house if you like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, whenever it suits you.&nbsp; You can slip in from the shrubbery

<P>at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up

<P>by that door.&nbsp; A good place is not it?&nbsp; But," (checking himself),

<P>"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept

<P>in the butler's room.&nbsp; Ay, so it always is, I believe.

<P>One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own
best.

<P>And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you

<P>to go about the house or not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have made very few changes either," continued the Admiral,

<P>after thinking a moment.&nbsp; "Very few.&nbsp; We told you about the
laundry-door,

<P>at Uppercross.&nbsp; That has been a very great improvement.

<P>The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience

<P>of its opening as it did, so long!&nbsp; You will tell Sir Walter

<P>what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement

<P>the house ever had.&nbsp; Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to
say,

<P>that the few alterations we have made have been all very much

<P>for the better.&nbsp; My wife should have the credit of them, however.

<P>I have done very little besides sending away some of the large

<P>looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's.

<P>A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:

<P>but I should think, Miss Elliot," (looking with serious reflection),

<P>"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.

<P>Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away

<P>from one's self.&nbsp; So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon

<P>shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my

<P>little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing

<P>that I never go near."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,

<P>and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,

<P>took up the subject again, to say--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,

<P>pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are

<P>settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find

<P>with the place.&nbsp; The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,

<P>I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,

<P>which may not happen three times a winter.&nbsp; And take it altogether,

<P>now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,

<P>there is not one that we like better than this.&nbsp; Pray say so,

<P>with my compliments.&nbsp; He will be glad to hear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:

<P>but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed

<P>far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced

<P>themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions

<P>in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again

<P>before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch
Hall,

<P>or of seeing him in company with her friend.&nbsp; Everything was safe
enough,

<P>and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted

<P>on the subject.
