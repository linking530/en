<P>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,

<P>for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;

<P>there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a

<P>distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and

<P>respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;

<P>there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs

<P>changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over

<P>the almost endless creations of the last century; and there,

<P>if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history

<P>with an interest which never failed.&nbsp; This was the page at which

<P>the favorite volume always opened:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.

<P>"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,

<P>daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of

<P>Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,

<P>born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,

<P>November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's
hands;

<P>but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of

<P>himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--

<P>"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles

<P>Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,"

<P>and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which

<P>he had lost his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,

<P>in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;

<P>how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,

<P>representing a borough in three successive parliaments,

<P>exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year

<P>of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;

<P>forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with

<P>the arms and motto:--"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county

<P>of Somerset," and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of

<P>the second Sir Walter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;

<P>vanity of person and of situation.&nbsp; He had been remarkably handsome

<P>in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.

<P>Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,

<P>nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with

<P>the place he held in society.&nbsp; He considered the blessing of beauty

<P>as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter
Elliot,

<P>who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect

<P>and devotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;

<P>since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character

<P>to any thing deserved by his own.&nbsp; Lady Elliot had been an excellent
woman,

<P>sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be

<P>pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,

<P>had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,

<P>or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real

<P>respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest

<P>being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,

<P>and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of

<P>indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.

<P>--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy

<P>for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to

<P>the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.

<P>She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,

<P>who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle

<P>close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,

<P>Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of

<P>the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously

<P>giving her daughters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been

<P>anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.&nbsp; Thirteen years

<P>had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still

<P>near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,

<P>the other a widow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely

<P>well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,

<P>needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably

<P>discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;

<P>but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.

<P>Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with

<P>one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),

<P>prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.

<P>For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,

<P>which he had not been very much tempted to do.&nbsp; Elizabeth had succeeded,

<P>at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights

<P>and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,

<P>her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together

<P>most happily.&nbsp; His two other children were of very inferior value.

<P>Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming

<P>Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness

<P>of character, which must have placed her high with any people

<P>of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;

<P>her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--

<P>she was only Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued

<P>god-daughter, favourite, and friend.&nbsp; Lady Russell loved them all;

<P>but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,

<P>but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,

<P>her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different

<P>were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),

<P>there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,

<P>to excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,

<P>of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.

<P>All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely

<P>connected herself with an old country family of respectability and

<P>large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:

<P>Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than

<P>she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been

<P>neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely
any

<P>charm is lost.&nbsp; It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome

<P>Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter

<P>might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,

<P>be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth

<P>as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody
else;

<P>for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and

<P>acquaintance were growing.&nbsp; Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face

<P>in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's
foot

<P>about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.

<P>Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and

<P>directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have
given

<P>the idea of her being younger than she was.&nbsp; For thirteen years
had

<P>she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,

<P>and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately
after

<P>Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.

<P>Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball

<P>of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs

<P>shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,

<P>for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.&nbsp; She had

<P>the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being

<P>nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;

<P>she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,

<P>but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced

<P>to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within

<P>the next twelvemonth or two.&nbsp; Then might she again take up

<P>the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,

<P>but now she liked it not.&nbsp; Always to be presented with the date
of

<P>her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,

<P>made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left
it

<P>open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,

<P>and pushed it away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,

<P>and especially the history of her own family, must ever present

<P>the remembrance of.&nbsp; The heir presumptive, the very William Walter

<P>Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported

<P>by her father, had disappointed her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,

<P>in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,

<P>meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.

<P>He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's
death,

<P>Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures

<P>had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,

<P>making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of

<P>their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,

<P>Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the
law;

<P>and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour

<P>was confirmed.&nbsp; He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked
of

<P>and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.
<BR>The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,

<P>again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;

<P>and the next tidings were that he was married.&nbsp; Instead of pushing

<P>his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,

<P>he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman

<P>of inferior birth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter has resented it.&nbsp; As the head of the house, he felt
that

<P>he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man

<P>so publicly by the hand; "For they must have been seen together,"

<P>he observed, "once at Tattersal's, and twice in the lobby of

<P>the House of Commons."&nbsp; His disapprobation was expressed,

<P>but apparently very little regarded.&nbsp; Mr Elliot had attempted no
apology,

<P>and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,

<P>as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:&nbsp; all acquaintance
between

<P>them had ceased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval

<P>of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man

<P>for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose

<P>strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter

<P>Elliot's eldest daughter.&nbsp; There was not a baronet from A to Z
whom

<P>her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.

<P>Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was

<P>at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons

<P>for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.

<P>The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was

<P>no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,

<P>had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention

<P>of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully

<P>of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood

<P>he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.

<P>This could not be pardoned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares

<P>to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,

<P>the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;

<P>such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence

<P>in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits

<P>of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to
be

<P>added to these.&nbsp; Her father was growing distressed for money.

<P>She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive

<P>the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of

<P>Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.&nbsp; The Kellynch property
was good,

<P>but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required

<P>in its possessor.&nbsp; While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,

<P>moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;

<P>but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period

<P>he had been constantly exceeding it.&nbsp; It had not been possible

<P>for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot

<P>was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was

<P>not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,

<P>that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,

<P>from his daughter.&nbsp; He had given her some hints of it the last
spring

<P>in town; he had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?

<P>Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which

<P>we can retrench?" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first

<P>ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,

<P>and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off

<P>some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing

<P>the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added

<P>the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,

<P>as had been the usual yearly custom.&nbsp; But these measures,

<P>however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent

<P>of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged

<P>to confess to her soon afterwards.&nbsp; Elizabeth had nothing to propose

<P>of deeper efficacy.&nbsp; She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,

<P>as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise

<P>any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,

<P>or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose
of;

<P>but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.
<BR>He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,

<P>but he would never condescend to sell.&nbsp; No; he would never disgrace

<P>his name so far.&nbsp; The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole

<P>and entire, as he had received it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in

<P>the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise
them;

<P>and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should
be

<P>struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments

<P>and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of

<P>any indulgence of taste or pride.
