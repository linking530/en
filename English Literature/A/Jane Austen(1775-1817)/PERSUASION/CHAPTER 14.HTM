<P>Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after

<P>Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been

<P>at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;

<P>and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross

<P>they drove over to the Lodge.&nbsp; They had left Louisa beginning to
sit up;

<P>but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves

<P>susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though

<P>she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,

<P>it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear

<P>the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return

<P>in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,

<P>had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had been all in lodgings together.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove had

<P>got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible

<P>supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience

<P>to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them

<P>to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been

<P>only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested

<P>and hospitable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident

<P>by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.

<P>Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when

<P>they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to
wait,

<P>and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;

<P>but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her

<P>on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much

<P>going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings

<P>and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,

<P>and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been

<P>much in favour of Lyme.&nbsp; She had been taken to Charmouth too,

<P>and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great
many

<P>more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;

<P>and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,

<P>had made really an agreeable fortnight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary's face was clouded directly.

<P>Charles laughed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is

<P>a very odd young man.&nbsp; I do not know what he would be at.

<P>We asked him to come home with us for a day or two:&nbsp; Charles undertook

<P>to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my
part,

<P>I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,

<P>he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot' and he had

<P>`been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had

<P>promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean
to come.

<P>I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word

<P>I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage

<P>for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles laughed again and said, "Now Mary, you know very well

<P>how it really was.&nbsp; It was all your doing," (turning to Anne.)

<P>"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:

<P>he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered

<P>that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,

<P>and he had not courage to come.&nbsp; That is the fact, upon my honour,

<P>Mary knows it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from

<P>not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation

<P>to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe

<P>Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be

<P>left to be guessed.&nbsp; Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened

<P>by what she heard.&nbsp; She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,

<P>and continued her enquiries.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! he talks of you," cried Charles, "in such terms--"

<P>Mary interrupted him. "I declare, Charles, I never heard him

<P>mention Anne twice all the time I was there.&nbsp; I declare, Anne,

<P>he never talks of you at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," admitted Charles, "I do not know that he ever does, in a general

<P>way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.

<P>His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,

<P>and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or
other

<P>in one of them which he thinks-- oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,

<P>but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta

<P>all about it; and then `Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms!

<P>Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were

<P>in the other room.&nbsp; `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was
no end

<P>of Miss Elliot's charms."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am sure," cried Mary, warmly, "it was a very little to his credit,

<P>if he did.&nbsp; Miss Harville only died last June.&nbsp; Such a heart

<P>is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?&nbsp; I am sure

<P>you will agree with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide," said Lady Russell, smiling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"

<P>said Charles.&nbsp; "Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,

<P>and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,

<P>he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,

<P>you may depend on it.&nbsp; I told him the distance and the road,

<P>and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing;

<P>for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would

<P>be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;

<P>and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.

<P>So, I give you notice, Lady Russell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,"

<P>was Lady Russell's kind answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he is rather

<P>my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy

<P>to see Captain Benwick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.

<P>He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.&nbsp; He has walked
with me,

<P>sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a
word.

<P>He is not at all a well-bred young man.&nbsp; I am sure you will not
like him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There we differ, Mary," said Anne.&nbsp; "I think Lady Russell would
like him.

<P>I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would

<P>very soon see no deficiency in his manner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So do I, Anne," said Charles.&nbsp; "I am sure Lady Russell would like
him.

<P>He is just Lady Russell's sort.&nbsp; Give him a book, and he will

<P>read all day long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, that he will!" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.&nbsp; "He will sit
poring

<P>over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one

<P>drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens.&nbsp; Do you think

<P>Lady Russell would like that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell could not help laughing.&nbsp; "Upon my word," said she,

<P>"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have

<P>admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact

<P>as I may call myself.&nbsp; I have really a curiosity to see the person

<P>who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.

<P>I wish he may be induced to call here.&nbsp; And when he does, Mary,

<P>you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined

<P>not to judge him beforehand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will not like him, I will answer for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell began talking of something else.&nbsp; Mary spoke with
animation

<P>of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is a man," said Lady Russell, "whom I have no wish to see.

<P>His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,

<P>has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short

<P>in the midst of the Elliot countenance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,

<P>there was voluntary communication sufficient.&nbsp; His spirits had
been

<P>greatly recovering lately as might be expected.&nbsp; As Louisa improved,

<P>he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature

<P>from what he had been the first week.&nbsp; He had not seen Louisa;

<P>and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her

<P>from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,

<P>on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week

<P>or ten days, till her head was stronger.&nbsp; He had talked of going

<P>down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick

<P>to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick

<P>seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both

<P>occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.

<P>Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might

<P>be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence

<P>in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,

<P>without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.

<P>Captain Benwick came not, however.&nbsp; He was either less disposed
for it

<P>than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him

<P>a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy

<P>of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,

<P>bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise

<P>of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.&nbsp; Henrietta remained with
Louisa;

<P>but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,

<P>when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive
again.

<P>Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,

<P>nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast

<P>as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,

<P>whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children

<P>from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.&nbsp; On one side

<P>was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk

<P>and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,

<P>bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys

<P>were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas
fire,

<P>which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise

<P>of the others.&nbsp; Charles and Mary also came in, of course,

<P>during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects

<P>to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,

<P>talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children

<P>on his knees, generally in vain.&nbsp; It was a fine family-piece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed

<P>such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,

<P>which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.&nbsp; But Mrs Musgrove,

<P>who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,

<P>again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded

<P>a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,

<P>with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,

<P>nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness

<P>at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Louisa was now recovering apace.&nbsp; Her mother could even think of
her

<P>being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters

<P>went to school again.&nbsp; The Harvilles had promised to come with
her

<P>and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth
was gone,

<P>for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope I shall remember, in future," said Lady Russell, as soon as

<P>they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross

<P>in the Christmas holidays."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;

<P>and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort

<P>rather than their quantity.&nbsp; When Lady Russell not long afterwards,

<P>was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through

<P>the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,

<P>amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,

<P>the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless

<P>clink of pattens, she made no complaint.&nbsp; No, these were noises

<P>which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose

<P>under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,

<P>though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could
be

<P>so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne did not share these feelings.&nbsp; She persisted in a very determined,

<P>though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view

<P>of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish

<P>of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,

<P>however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her

<P>when she arrived?&nbsp; And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles

<P>of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.

<P>Mr Elliot was in Bath.&nbsp; He had called in Camden Place; had called

<P>a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.&nbsp; If Elizabeth

<P>and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains

<P>to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,

<P>as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.&nbsp; This was very
wonderful

<P>if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable

<P>curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment

<P>she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being "a man whom she had

<P>no wish to see."&nbsp; She had a great wish to see him.&nbsp; If he
really sought

<P>to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven

<P>for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,

<P>but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,

<P>which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove

<P>to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.
