<P>While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their

<P>good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance

<P>of a very different description.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her

<P>of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong
claims

<P>on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.&nbsp; Miss
Hamilton,

<P>now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her
life

<P>when it had been most valuable.&nbsp; Anne had gone unhappy to school,

<P>grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,

<P>feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,

<P>of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;

<P>and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the
want

<P>of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,

<P>had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened

<P>her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,

<P>was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all

<P>that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess's account

<P>brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was a widow and poor.&nbsp; Her husband had been extravagant;

<P>and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs

<P>dreadfully involved.&nbsp; She had had difficulties of every sort

<P>to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted

<P>with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,

<P>had made her for the present a cripple.&nbsp; She had come to Bath

<P>on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,

<P>living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself

<P>the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit

<P>from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore

<P>lost no time in going.&nbsp; She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,

<P>or what she intended, at home.&nbsp; It would excite no proper interest
there.

<P>She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,

<P>and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings

<P>in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest

<P>in each other more than re-kindled.&nbsp; The first ten minutes

<P>had its awkwardness and its emotion.&nbsp; Twelve years were gone

<P>since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person

<P>from what the other had imagined.&nbsp; Twelve years had changed Anne

<P>from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant

<P>little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,

<P>and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;

<P>and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,

<P>in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,

<P>infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee

<P>as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon

<P>passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering

<P>former partialities and talking over old times.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which

<P>she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse

<P>and be cheerful beyond her expectation.&nbsp; Neither the dissipations

<P>of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions

<P>of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have

<P>closed her heart or ruined her spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,

<P>and Anne's astonishment increased.&nbsp; She could scarcely imagine

<P>a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.&nbsp; She had
been

<P>very fond of her husband:&nbsp; she had buried him.&nbsp; She had been

<P>used to affluence:&nbsp; it was gone.&nbsp; She had no child to connect
her

<P>with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement

<P>of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.

<P>Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom

<P>behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without

<P>assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,

<P>and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.

<P>Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had

<P>moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation

<P>and enjoyment.&nbsp; How could it be?&nbsp; She watched, observed, reflected,

<P>and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude

<P>or of resignation only.&nbsp; A submissive spirit might be patient,

<P>a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something
more;

<P>here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,

<P>that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment

<P>which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.

<P>It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend

<P>as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,

<P>it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits

<P>had nearly failed.&nbsp; She could not call herself an invalid now,

<P>compared with her state on first reaching Bath.&nbsp; Then she had,
indeed,

<P>been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,

<P>and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again

<P>confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;

<P>and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having

<P>a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit

<P>to meet any extraordinary expense.&nbsp; She had weathered it, however,

<P>and could truly say that it had done her good.&nbsp; It had increased

<P>her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.

<P>She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested

<P>attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady

<P>had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had
been

<P>particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,

<P>a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house

<P>when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.

<P>"And she," said Mrs Smith, "besides nursing me most admirably,

<P>has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.&nbsp; As soon as I could

<P>use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;

<P>and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,

<P>pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,

<P>and which supply me with the means of doing a little good

<P>to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.

<P>She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those

<P>who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandize.

<P>She always takes the right time for applying.&nbsp; Everybody's heart
is open,

<P>you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,

<P>or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke

<P>thoroughly understands when to speak.&nbsp; She is a shrewd, intelligent,

<P>sensible woman.&nbsp; Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she
has

<P>a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her

<P>infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received

<P>`the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.

<P>Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's

<P>leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate

<P>that is entertaining and profitable:&nbsp; something that makes one

<P>know one's species better.&nbsp; One likes to hear what is going on,

<P>to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.

<P>To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a
treat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,

<P>"I can easily believe it.&nbsp; Women of that class have great opportunities,

<P>and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.

<P>Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!

<P>And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;

<P>for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be

<P>most interesting or affecting.&nbsp; What instances must pass before
them

<P>of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,

<P>patience, resignation:&nbsp; of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices

<P>that ennoble us most.&nbsp; A sick chamber may often furnish

<P>the worth of volumes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may,

<P>though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.

<P>Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;

<P>but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength

<P>that appears in a sick chamber:&nbsp; it is selfishness and impatience

<P>rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.

<P>There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately"

<P>(speaking low and tremulously) "there are so many who forget

<P>to think seriously till it is almost too late."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne saw the misery of such feelings.&nbsp; The husband had not been

<P>what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind

<P>which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.

<P>It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,

<P>and soon added in a different tone--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,

<P>will furnish much either to interest or edify me.&nbsp; She is only
nursing

<P>Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,

<P>fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report

<P>but of lace and finery.&nbsp; I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,
however.

<P>She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all

<P>the high-priced things I have in hand now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence

<P>of such a person was known in Camden Place.&nbsp; At last, it became
necessary

<P>to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning

<P>from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple

<P>for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening

<P>in Westgate Buildings.&nbsp; She was not sorry for the excuse.

<P>They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being

<P>kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship

<P>which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account

<P>with great alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening

<P>with an old schoolfellow."&nbsp; They were not much interested in anything

<P>relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,

<P>to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth

<P>was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Westgate Buildings!" said he, "and who is Miss Anne Elliot

<P>to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?&nbsp; A Mrs Smith.&nbsp; A widow
Mrs Smith;

<P>and who was her husband?&nbsp; One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose
names

<P>are to be met with everywhere.&nbsp; And what is her attraction?

<P>That she is old and sickly.&nbsp; Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,

<P>you have the most extraordinary taste!&nbsp; Everything that revolts

<P>other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations

<P>are inviting to you.&nbsp; But surely you may put off this old lady

<P>till to-morrow:&nbsp; she is not so near her end, I presume,

<P>but that she may hope to see another day.&nbsp; What is her age?&nbsp;
Forty?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can

<P>put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time

<P>which will at once suit her and myself.&nbsp; She goes into the warm
bath

<P>to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?" asked Elizabeth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary,

<P>she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have

<P>called on Mrs Smith.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance

<P>of a carriage drawn up near its pavement," observed Sir Walter.

<P>"Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her
arms,

<P>but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known

<P>to convey a Miss Elliot.&nbsp; A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate
Buildings!

<P>A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;

<P>a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names

<P>in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,

<P>and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility

<P>of England and Ireland!&nbsp; Mrs Smith!&nbsp; Such a name!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it

<P>advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,

<P>and did long to say a little in defense of her friend's

<P>not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect

<P>to her father prevented her.&nbsp; She made no reply.&nbsp; She left
it

<P>to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow

<P>in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,

<P>and no sirname of dignity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course

<P>she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.

<P>She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter

<P>and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves,

<P>but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,

<P>and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;

<P>and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,

<P>and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements

<P>in order to wait on her.&nbsp; Anne had the whole history of all that

<P>such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.&nbsp; To her,

<P>its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of

<P>between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,

<P>and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.

<P>Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,

<P>sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.

<P>He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,

<P>mind, a model of female excellence.&nbsp; He could meet even Lady Russell

<P>in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand

<P>so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated

<P>by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations

<P>which her friend meant to create.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.

<P>She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of

<P>his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks

<P>which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,

<P>and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.

<P>She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the
subject,

<P>she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,

<P>of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,

<P>supposing such attachment to be real and returned.&nbsp; Anne heard
her,

<P>and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,

<P>and gently shook her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am no match-maker, as you well know," said Lady Russell,

<P>"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events

<P>and calculations.&nbsp; I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time
hence

<P>pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,

<P>I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.

<P>A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think

<P>it might be a very happy one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects

<P>I think highly of him," said Anne; "but we should not suit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that

<P>to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,

<P>the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying

<P>your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights,

<P>and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be

<P>the highest possible gratification to me.&nbsp; You are your mother's
self

<P>in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you

<P>such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing

<P>in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!

<P>My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt

<P>at my time of life!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,

<P>and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings

<P>this picture excited.&nbsp; For a few moments her imagination and her
heart

<P>were bewitched.&nbsp; The idea of becoming what her mother had been;

<P>of having the precious name of "Lady Elliot" first revived in herself;

<P>of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,

<P>her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.

<P>Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter

<P>to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment

<P>with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,

<P>what Anne did not believe.&nbsp; The same image of Mr Elliot speaking

<P>for himself brought Anne to composure again.&nbsp; The charm of Kellynch

<P>and of "Lady Elliot" all faded away.&nbsp; She never could accept him.

<P>And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man

<P>save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities

<P>of such a case was against Mr Elliot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied

<P>that she really knew his character.&nbsp; That he was a sensible man,

<P>an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,

<P>seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all

<P>clear enough.&nbsp; He certainly knew what was right, nor could she
fix

<P>on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she
would

<P>have been afraid to answer for his conduct.&nbsp; She distrusted the
past,

<P>if not the present.&nbsp; The names which occasionally dropt

<P>of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,

<P>suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.

<P>She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling

<P>had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life

<P>(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,

<P>careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think

<P>very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,

<P>cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?

<P>How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.

<P>There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,

<P>at the evil or good of others.&nbsp; This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.

<P>Her early impressions were incurable.&nbsp; She prized the frank,

<P>the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.

<P>Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.&nbsp; She felt that she
could

<P>so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked

<P>or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of
mind

<P>never varied, whose tongue never slipped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.&nbsp; Various as were the tempers

<P>in her father's house, he pleased them all.&nbsp; He endured too well,

<P>stood too well with every body.&nbsp; He had spoken to her with some

<P>degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see

<P>what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet

<P>Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,

<P>for she saw nothing to excite distrust.&nbsp; She could not imagine

<P>a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she

<P>ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive

<P>the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of

<P>the following autumn.
