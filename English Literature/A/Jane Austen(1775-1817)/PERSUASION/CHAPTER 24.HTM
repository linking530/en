<P>Who can be in doubt of what followed?&nbsp; When any two young people

<P>take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance

<P>to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,

<P>or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.
<BR>This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;

<P>and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and

<P>an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,

<P>consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,

<P>fail of bearing down every opposition?&nbsp; They might in fact,

<P>have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was

<P>little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.
<BR>Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse

<P>than look cold and unconcerned.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty

<P>thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity

<P>could place him, was no longer nobody.&nbsp; He was now esteemed quite
worthy

<P>to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,

<P>who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself

<P>in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could

<P>give his daughter at present but a small part of the share

<P>of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,

<P>and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,

<P>was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.&nbsp; On the contrary,

<P>when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,

<P>and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,

<P>and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced

<P>against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by

<P>his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,

<P>with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage

<P>in the volume of honour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite

<P>any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.&nbsp; Anne knew that Lady Russell

<P>must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,

<P>and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,

<P>and do justice to Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; This however was what

<P>Lady Russell had now to do.&nbsp; She must learn to feel that she had

<P>been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced

<P>by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners

<P>had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them

<P>to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because

<P>Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety

<P>and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been

<P>too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct

<P>opinions and well-regulated mind.&nbsp; There was nothing less

<P>for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been

<P>pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions

<P>and of hopes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment

<P>of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience

<P>in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted

<P>in this part of understanding than her young friend.&nbsp; But she was

<P>a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible

<P>and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.&nbsp; She loved Anne

<P>better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness

<P>of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself

<P>as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified

<P>by the circumstance.&nbsp; It was creditable to have a sister married,

<P>and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental

<P>to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;

<P>and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters,

<P>it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man
than

<P>either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.&nbsp; She had something to
suffer,

<P>perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored

<P>to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;

<P>but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.
<BR>Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,

<P>no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth

<P>from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied

<P>with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.
<BR>She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,

<P>and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise

<P>even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The news of his cousins Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot

<P>most unexpectedly.&nbsp; It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,

<P>his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness

<P>which a son-in-law's rights would have given.&nbsp; But, though discomfited

<P>and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest

<P>and his own enjoyment.&nbsp; He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's

<P>quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established

<P>under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game

<P>he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself

<P>from being cut out by one artful woman, at least.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,

<P>for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming longer

<P>for Sir Walter.&nbsp; She has abilities, however, as well as affections;

<P>and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,

<P>may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being

<P>the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last

<P>into making her the wife of Sir William.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked

<P>and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of

<P>their deception in her.&nbsp; They had their great cousins, to be sure,

<P>to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter

<P>and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,

<P>is but a state of half enjoyment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning

<P>to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy

<P>to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness

<P>of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.
<BR>There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.&nbsp; The disproportion

<P>in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret;

<P>but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,

<P>nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer

<P>in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her

<P>in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain

<P>as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise

<P>strong felicity.&nbsp; She had but two friends in the world to add to
his list,

<P>Lady Russell and Mrs Smith.&nbsp; To those, however, he was very well
disposed

<P>to attach himself.&nbsp; Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,

<P>he could now value from his heart.&nbsp; While he was not obliged to
say

<P>that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,

<P>he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,

<P>and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her

<P>quickly and permanently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,

<P>and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,

<P>secured her two.&nbsp; She was their earliest visitor in their settled
life;

<P>and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering

<P>her husband's property in the West Indies, by writing for her,

<P>acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties

<P>of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man

<P>and a determined friend, fully requited the services which

<P>she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,

<P>with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends

<P>to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not

<P>fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might
have

<P>bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.
<BR>She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,

<P>and yet be happy.&nbsp; Her spring of felicity was in the glow

<P>of her spirits, as her friend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.
<BR>Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it

<P>in Captain Wentworth's affection.&nbsp; His profession was all that
could ever

<P>make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war

<P>all that could dim her sunshine.&nbsp; She gloried in being a sailor's
wife,

<P>but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession

<P>which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues

<P>than in its national importance.
