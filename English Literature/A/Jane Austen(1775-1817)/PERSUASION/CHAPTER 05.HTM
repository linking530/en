<P>On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch
Hall,

<P>Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's,

<P>and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural

<P>to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,

<P>and decided the whole business at once.&nbsp; Each lady was previously

<P>well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,

<P>but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,

<P>there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality

<P>on the Admiral's side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,

<P>who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished

<P>behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report,

<P>to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts

<P>were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;

<P>and Mr Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been

<P>a single preliminary difference to modify of all that

<P>"This indenture sheweth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be

<P>the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to
say,

<P>that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,

<P>he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;

<P>and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife

<P>as they drove back through the park, "I thought we should soon

<P>come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.

<P>The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be

<P>no harm in him."&nbsp; reciprocal compliments, which would have been

<P>esteemed about equal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter

<P>proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,

<P>there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any
use,

<P>or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were

<P>going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,

<P>and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might

<P>convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements

<P>of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,

<P>she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne

<P>though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare

<P>of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad

<P>of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,

<P>everything considered, she wished to remain.&nbsp; It would be most
right,

<P>and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering

<P>to go with the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.

<P>Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal

<P>of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne

<P>when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing

<P>that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated,

<P>or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to

<P>Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want
her,

<P>instead of going to Bath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot possibly do without Anne," was Mary's reasoning;

<P>and Elizabeth's reply was, "Then I am sure Anne had better stay,

<P>for nobody will want her in Bath."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least

<P>better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to

<P>be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,

<P>and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,

<P>and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties,

<P>and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath

<P>till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time

<P>should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled

<P>by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on
her,

<P>which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter

<P>and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter

<P>in all the business before her.&nbsp; Lady Russell was extremely sorry

<P>that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,

<P>grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,

<P>in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,

<P>was a very sore aggravation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt

<P>the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.

<P>With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,

<P>which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was

<P>sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy

<P>were more than possible.&nbsp; She did not imagine that her father

<P>had at present an idea of the kind.&nbsp; Mrs Clay had freckles,

<P>and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually

<P>making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,

<P>and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind

<P>and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions

<P>than any merely personal might have been.&nbsp; Anne was so impressed

<P>by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself

<P>from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.&nbsp; She had little
hope

<P>of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would
be

<P>so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,

<P>have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She spoke, and seemed only to offend.&nbsp; Elizabeth could not conceive

<P>how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly

<P>answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs Clay," said she, warmly, "never forgets who she is;

<P>and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can
be,

<P>I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are

<P>particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition

<P>and rank more strongly than most people.&nbsp; And as to my father,

<P>I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single

<P>so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.&nbsp; If Mrs Clay were

<P>a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her

<P>so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,

<P>would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might

<P>be rendered unhappy.&nbsp; But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,

<P>can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor

<P>Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.&nbsp; One would imagine

<P>you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,

<P>though I know you must fifty times.&nbsp; That tooth of her's

<P>and those freckles.&nbsp; Freckles do not disgust me so very much

<P>as they do him.&nbsp; I have known a face not materially disfigured
by a few,

<P>but he abominates them.&nbsp; You must have heard him notice

<P>Mrs Clay's freckles."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is hardly any personal defect," replied Anne,

<P>"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think very differently," answered Elizabeth, shortly;

<P>"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never

<P>alter plain ones.&nbsp; However, at any rate, as I have a great deal
more

<P>at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it

<P>rather unnecessary in you to be advising me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless

<P>of doing good.&nbsp; Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,

<P>might yet be made observant by it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,

<P>Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.&nbsp; The party drove off

<P>in very good spirits;&nbsp; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows

<P>for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint

<P>to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time,

<P>in a sort of desolate tranquility, to the Lodge, where she was to spend

<P>the first week.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt
this

<P>break-up of the family exceedingly.&nbsp; Their respectability was

<P>as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become

<P>precious by habit.&nbsp; It was painful to look upon their deserted
grounds,

<P>and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;

<P>and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,

<P>and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,

<P>she had determined to make her own absence from home begin

<P>when she must give up Anne.&nbsp; Accordingly their removal was made
together,

<P>and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage

<P>of Lady Russell's journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back

<P>had been completely in the old English style, containing only

<P>two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;

<P>the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old
trees,

<P>substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,

<P>enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree

<P>trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire,

<P>it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,

<P>for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,

<P>French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch

<P>the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect

<P>and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Anne had often been staying.&nbsp; She knew the ways of Uppercross

<P>as well as those of Kellynch.&nbsp; The two families were so continually
meeting,

<P>so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house

<P>at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;

<P>but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost

<P>a matter of course.&nbsp; Though better endowed than the elder sister,

<P>Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper.&nbsp; While well, and
happy,

<P>and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;

<P>but any indisposition sunk her completely.&nbsp; She had no resources

<P>for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot

<P>self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress

<P>that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.&nbsp; In person, she
was

<P>inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached

<P>the dignity of being "a fine girl."&nbsp; She was now lying on the faded
sofa

<P>of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which

<P>had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers

<P>and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So, you are come at last!&nbsp; I began to think I should never see
you.

<P>I am so ill I can hardly speak.&nbsp; I have not seen a creature

<P>the whole morning!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry to find you unwell," replied Anne.&nbsp; "You sent me

<P>such a good account of yourself on Thursday!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:&nbsp; but I was very far from
well

<P>at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life

<P>as I have been all this morning:&nbsp; very unfit to be left alone,
I am sure.

<P>Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,

<P>and not able to ring the bell!&nbsp; So, Lady Russell would not get
out.

<P>I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.

<P>"Oh! Charles is out shooting.&nbsp; I have not seen him since seven
o'clock.

<P>He would go, though I told him how ill I was.&nbsp; He said he should
not

<P>stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.

<P>I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have had your little boys with you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable

<P>that they do me more harm than good.&nbsp; Little Charles does not mind

<P>a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, you will soon be better now," replied Anne, cheerfully.

<P>"You know I always cure you when I come.&nbsp; How are your neighbours

<P>at the Great House?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can give you no account of them.&nbsp; I have not seen one of them
to-day,

<P>except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,

<P>but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,

<P>not one of them have been near me.&nbsp; It did not happen to suit

<P>the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves

<P>out of their way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.

<P>It is early."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never want them, I assure you.&nbsp; They talk and laugh a great
deal

<P>too much for me.&nbsp; Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!&nbsp; It was quite
unkind

<P>of you not to come on Thursday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!

<P>You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,

<P>and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware

<P>that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:

<P>and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,

<P>have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have

<P>left Kellynch sooner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A great many things, I assure you.&nbsp; More than I can recollect

<P>in a moment; but I can tell you some.&nbsp; I have been making

<P>a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures.

<P>I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,

<P>trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's
plants

<P>are for Lady Russell.&nbsp; I have had all my own little concerns

<P>to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,

<P>from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:

<P>and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:

<P>going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.

<P>I was told that they wished it.&nbsp; But all these things took up

<P>a great deal of time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! well!" and after a moment's pause, "but you have never asked me

<P>one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you go then?&nbsp; I have made no enquiries, because I concluded

<P>you must have been obliged to give up the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes! I went.&nbsp; I was very well yesterday; nothing at all

<P>the matter with me till this morning.&nbsp; It would have been strange

<P>if I had not gone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant
party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing remarkable.&nbsp; One always knows beforehand what the dinner
will be,

<P>and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having

<P>a carriage of one's own.&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were

<P>so crowded!&nbsp; They are both so very large, and take up so much room;

<P>and Mr Musgrove always sits forward.&nbsp; So, there was I, crowded
into

<P>the back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely

<P>that my illness to-day may be owing to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness

<P>on Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.&nbsp; She could soon

<P>sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able

<P>to leave it by dinner-time.&nbsp; Then, forgetting to think of it,

<P>she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;

<P>then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough

<P>to propose a little walk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where shall we go?" said she, when they were ready.&nbsp; "I suppose

<P>you will not like to call at the Great House before they have

<P>been to see you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied Anne.

<P>"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know

<P>so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.

<P>They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.&nbsp; However,

<P>we may as well go and sit with them a little&nbsp; while, and when we

<P>have that over, we can enjoy our walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;

<P>but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,

<P>though there were on each side continual subjects of offence,

<P>neither family could now do without it.&nbsp; To the Great House accordingly

<P>they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,

<P>with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present

<P>daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion

<P>by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables

<P>placed in every direction.&nbsp; Oh! could the originals of the portraits

<P>against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and

<P>the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious

<P>of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!&nbsp; The portraits
themselves

<P>seemed to be staring in astonishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,

<P>perhaps of improvement.&nbsp; The father and mother were in the old

<P>English style, and the young people in the new.&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Musgrove

<P>were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,

<P>not much educated, and not at all elegant.&nbsp; Their children had

<P>more modern minds and manners.&nbsp; There was a numerous family;

<P>but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,

<P>young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at
Exeter

<P>all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands

<P>of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.

<P>Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,

<P>their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;

<P>they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.

<P>Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures

<P>of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some

<P>comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility

<P>of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant

<P>and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing

<P>but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,

<P>that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known

<P>so little herself with either of her sisters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were received with great cordiality.&nbsp; Nothing seemed amiss

<P>on the side of the Great House family, which was generally,

<P>as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.&nbsp; The half hour was

<P>chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised

<P>at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both

<P>the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation.
