<P>Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise

<P>of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home

<P>at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid

<P>Mr Elliot was almost a first object.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.&nbsp; In spite of

<P>the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,

<P>perhaps compassion.&nbsp; She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary

<P>circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which

<P>he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,

<P>by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.&nbsp; It was altogether

<P>very extraordinary; flattering, but painful.&nbsp; There was much to
regret.

<P>How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,

<P>was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;

<P>and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,

<P>her affection would be his for ever.&nbsp; Their union, she believed,

<P>could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,

<P>could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne

<P>was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.

<P>It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning

<P>particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected
her,

<P>though it had been an appointment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections

<P>of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features

<P>and make her rejoice to talk of it.&nbsp; All that she could tell

<P>she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,

<P>and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had

<P>already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,

<P>rather more of the general success and produce of the evening

<P>than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars

<P>of the company.&nbsp; Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath

<P>was well know by name to Mrs Smith.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The little Durands were there, I conclude," said she, "with their mouths

<P>open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.

<P>They never miss a concert."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were

<P>in the room."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,

<P>with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; I do not think they were."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Old Lady Mary Maclean?&nbsp; I need not ask after her.&nbsp; She never
misses,

<P>I know; and you must have seen her.&nbsp; She must have been in your
own circle;

<P>for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,

<P>round the orchestra, of course."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, that was what I dreaded.&nbsp; It would have been very unpleasant
to me

<P>in every respect.&nbsp; But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses

<P>to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,

<P>for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen

<P>very little."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.&nbsp; I can understand.

<P>There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,

<P>and this you had.&nbsp; You were a large party in yourselves,

<P>and you wanted nothing beyond."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I ought to have looked about me more," said Anne, conscious

<P>while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,

<P>that the object only had been deficient.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no; you were better employed.&nbsp; You need not tell me that you

<P>had a pleasant evening.&nbsp; I see it in your eye.&nbsp; I perfectly
see

<P>how the hours passed:&nbsp; that you had always something agreeable

<P>to listen to.&nbsp; In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eye?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I do.&nbsp; Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were

<P>in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable

<P>in the world, the person who interests you at this present time

<P>more than all the rest of the world put together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.&nbsp; She could say nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And such being the case," continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,

<P>"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness

<P>in coming to me this morning.&nbsp; It is really very good of you

<P>to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands

<P>upon your time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne heard nothing of this.&nbsp; She was still in the astonishment
and

<P>confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine

<P>how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.

<P>After another short silence--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Pray," said Mrs Smith, "is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with
me?

<P>Does he know that I am in Bath?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr Elliot!" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.&nbsp; A moment's reflection

<P>shewed her the mistake she had been under.&nbsp; She caught it instantaneously;

<P>and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,

<P>more composedly, "Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been a good deal acquainted with him," replied Mrs Smith, gravely,

<P>"but it seems worn out now.&nbsp; It is a great while since we met."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was not at all aware of this.&nbsp; You never mentioned it before.

<P>Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about
you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To confess the truth," said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual

<P>air of cheerfulness, "that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.

<P>I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.&nbsp; I want your interest
with him.

<P>He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,

<P>my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,

<P>of course it is done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness

<P>to be of even the slightest use to you," replied Anne; "but I suspect

<P>that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,

<P>a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.

<P>I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.

<P>You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation.&nbsp; If in that
light

<P>there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,

<P>I beg you would not hesitate to employ me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.

<P>I ought to have waited for official information,&nbsp; But now, my dear

<P>Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.

<P>Next week?&nbsp; To be sure by next week I may be allowed to

<P>think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on

<P>Mr Elliot's good fortune."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," replied Anne, "nor next week, nor next, nor next.

<P>I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of

<P>will be settled any week.&nbsp; I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.

<P>I should like to know why you imagine I am?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,

<P>shook her head, and exclaimed--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, how I do wish I understood you!&nbsp; How I do wish I knew

<P>what you were at!&nbsp; I have a great idea that you do not design to
be cruel,

<P>when the right moment occurs.&nbsp; Till it does come, you know,

<P>we women never mean to have anybody.&nbsp; It is a thing of course among
us,

<P>that every man is refused, till he offers.&nbsp; But why should you
be cruel?

<P>Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for

<P>my former friend.&nbsp; Where can you look for a more suitable match?

<P>Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?

<P>Let me recommend Mr Elliot.&nbsp; I am sure you hear nothing but good
of him

<P>from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above

<P>half a year.&nbsp; He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses

<P>to any one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! if these are your only objections," cried Mrs Smith, archly,

<P>"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.

<P>Do not forget me when you are married, that's all.&nbsp; Let him know
me to be

<P>a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,

<P>which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements

<P>of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.

<P>Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.&nbsp; Of course,

<P>he cannot be aware of the importance to me.&nbsp; Well, my dear Miss
Elliot,

<P>I hope and trust you will be very happy.&nbsp; Mr Elliot has sense

<P>to understand the value of such a woman.&nbsp; Your peace will not be

<P>shipwrecked as mine has been.&nbsp; You are safe in all worldly matters,

<P>and safe in his character.&nbsp; He will not be led astray; he will
not be

<P>misled by others to his ruin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Anne, "I can readily believe all that of my cousin.

<P>He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open

<P>to dangerous impressions.&nbsp; I consider him with great respect.

<P>I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,

<P>to do otherwise.&nbsp; But I have not known him long; and he is not
a man,

<P>I think, to be known intimately soon.&nbsp; Will not this manner

<P>of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?

<P>Surely this must be calm enough.&nbsp; And, upon my word, he is nothing
to me.

<P>Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine

<P>he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.&nbsp; I assure
you

<P>I shall not.&nbsp; I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which

<P>you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert

<P>of last night might afford:&nbsp; not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot
that--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;

<P>but less would hardly have been sufficient.&nbsp; Mrs Smith would hardly

<P>have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception

<P>of there being a somebody else.&nbsp; As it was, she instantly submitted,

<P>and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,

<P>eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith

<P>should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have

<P>received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do tell me how it first came into your head."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It first came into my head," replied Mrs Smith, "upon finding how much

<P>you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing

<P>in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;

<P>and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed
of you

<P>in the same way.&nbsp; But I never heard it spoken of till two days
ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And has it indeed been spoken of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when

<P>you called yesterday?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No.&nbsp; Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?&nbsp; I observed

<P>no one in particular."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,

<P>had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way

<P>to let you in.&nbsp; She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on
Sunday;

<P>and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.

<P>She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.

<P>She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history."

<P>"The whole history," repeated Anne, laughing.&nbsp; "She could not make

<P>a very long history, I think, of one such little article

<P>of unfounded news."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Smith said nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But," continued Anne, presently, "though there is no truth in my having

<P>this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to
you

<P>in any way that I could.&nbsp; Shall I mention to him your being in
Bath?

<P>Shall I take any message?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I thank you:&nbsp; no, certainly not.&nbsp; In the warmth of the
moment,

<P>and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured

<P>to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.&nbsp; No, I thank
you,

<P>I have nothing to trouble you with."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not before he was married, I suppose?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And--were you much acquainted?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Intimately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!&nbsp; Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.

<P>I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young
man.

<P>Was he at all such as he appears now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years," was Mrs Smith's answer,

<P>given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;

<P>and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.

<P>They were both silent:&nbsp; Mrs Smith very thoughtful.&nbsp; At last--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot," she cried, in her

<P>natural tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the short answers

<P>I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.

<P>I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.

<P>There were many things to be taken into the account.&nbsp; One hates

<P>to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.

<P>Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,

<P>though there may be nothing durable beneath.&nbsp; However, I have determined;

<P>I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted

<P>with Mr Elliot's real character.&nbsp; Though I fully believe that,

<P>at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,

<P>there is no saying what may happen.&nbsp; You might, some time or other,

<P>be differently affected towards him.&nbsp; Hear the truth, therefore,

<P>now, while you are unprejudiced.&nbsp; Mr Elliot is a man without heart

<P>or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks

<P>only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty

<P>of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without

<P>risk of his general character.&nbsp; He has no feeling for others.

<P>Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,

<P>he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.

<P>He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.

<P>Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,

<P>and in a calmer manner, she added,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My expressions startle you.&nbsp; You must allow for an injured, angry
woman.

<P>But I will try to command myself.&nbsp; I will not abuse him.

<P>I will only tell you what I have found him.&nbsp; Facts shall speak.

<P>He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved
him,

<P>and thought him as good as himself.&nbsp; The intimacy had been formed

<P>before our marriage.&nbsp; I found them most intimate friends; and I,
too,

<P>became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained

<P>the highest opinion of him.&nbsp; At nineteen, you know, one does not

<P>think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as
others,

<P>and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost

<P>always together.&nbsp; We were principally in town, living in very good
style.

<P>He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;

<P>he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do

<P>to support the appearance of a gentleman.&nbsp; He had always a home

<P>with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.

<P>My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,

<P>would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse

<P>was open to him; I know that he often assisted him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,"

<P>said Anne, "which has always excited my particular curiosity.

<P>It must have been about the same time that he became known to

<P>my father and sister.&nbsp; I never knew him myself; I only heard of
him;

<P>but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to

<P>my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,

<P>which I never could quite reconcile with present times.&nbsp; It seemed

<P>to announce a different sort of man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know it all, I know it all," cried Mrs Smith.&nbsp; "He had been

<P>introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with
him,

<P>but I heard him speak of them for ever.&nbsp; I know he was invited

<P>and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.&nbsp; I can satisfy
you,

<P>perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,

<P>I knew all about it at the time.&nbsp; I was privy to all the fors and
againsts;

<P>I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though

<P>I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,

<P>indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,

<P>or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer

<P>any question you may wish to put."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay," said Anne, "I have no particular enquiry to make about her.

<P>I have always understood they were not a happy couple.&nbsp; But I should

<P>like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight

<P>my father's acquaintance as he did.&nbsp; My father was certainly disposed

<P>to take very kind and proper notice of him.&nbsp; Why did Mr Elliot
draw back?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr Elliot," replied Mrs Smith, "at that period of his life,

<P>had one object in view:&nbsp; to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker

<P>process than the law.&nbsp; He was determined to make it by marriage.

<P>He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;

<P>and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course

<P>I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities

<P>and invitations, were designing a match between the heir

<P>and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match

<P>should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.

<P>That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.

<P>He told me the whole story.&nbsp; He had no concealments with me.

<P>It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,

<P>my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;

<P>and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father

<P>and sister.&nbsp; He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought

<P>very affectionately of the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps," cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, "you sometimes

<P>spoke of me to Mr Elliot?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure I did; very often.&nbsp; I used to boast of my own Anne
Elliot,

<P>and vouch for your being a very different creature from--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She checked herself just in time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,"

<P>cried Anne.&nbsp; "This explains it.&nbsp; I found he had been used
to hear of me.

<P>I could not comprehend how.&nbsp; What wild imaginations one forms where

<P>dear self is concerned!&nbsp; How sure to be mistaken!&nbsp; But I beg
your pardon;

<P>I have interrupted you.&nbsp; Mr Elliot married then completely for
money?

<P>The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes

<P>to his character."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.&nbsp; "Oh! those things are too common.

<P>When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money

<P>is too common to strike one as it ought.&nbsp; I was very young,

<P>and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,

<P>gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.&nbsp; We lived for enjoyment.

<P>I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me

<P>other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible

<P>in what Mr Elliot was doing.&nbsp; `To do the best for himself,'

<P>passed as a duty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But was not she a very low woman?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.&nbsp; Money, money,

<P>was all that he wanted.&nbsp; Her father was a grazier, her grandfather

<P>had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.&nbsp; She was a fine woman,

<P>had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,

<P>thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him;

<P>and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,

<P>with respect to her birth.&nbsp; All his caution was spent in being
secured

<P>of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.

<P>Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation

<P>in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.

<P>His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour

<P>of the family he held as cheap as dirt.&nbsp; I have often heard him
declare,

<P>that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his

<P>for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;

<P>but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say

<P>on that subject.&nbsp; It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have
proof,

<P>for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none," cried Anne.&nbsp; "You have
asserted

<P>nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.

<P>This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.

<P>I am more curious to know why he should be so different now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for
Mary;

<P>stay:&nbsp; I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of

<P>going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box

<P>which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.

<P>The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over
it

<P>as she unlocked it, said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;

<P>a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.

<P>The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him

<P>before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.

<P>But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;

<P>and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others

<P>still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,

<P>while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.

<P>Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little

<P>satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document

<P>of former intimacy.&nbsp; I have now another motive for being glad

<P>that I can produce it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the letter, directed to "Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,"

<P>and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.&nbsp; Your kindness almost overpowers
me.

<P>I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have

<P>lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.

<P>At present, believe me, I have no need of your services,

<P>being in cash again.&nbsp; Give me joy:&nbsp; I have got rid of Sir
Walter and Miss.

<P>They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them

<P>this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,

<P>to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.

<P>The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;

<P>he is quite fool enough.&nbsp; If he does, however, they will leave
me in peace,

<P>which may be a decent equivalent&nbsp; for the reversion.&nbsp; He is
worse

<P>than last year.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I had any name but Elliot.&nbsp; I am sick of it.&nbsp; The
name of Walter

<P>I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me

<P>with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,

<P>to be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;

<P>and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.&nbsp; Though I have
forgot

<P>the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.

<P>But it shows you the man.&nbsp; Mark his professions to my poor husband.

<P>Can any thing be stronger?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification

<P>of finding such words applied to her father.&nbsp; She was obliged to
recollect

<P>that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,

<P>that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,

<P>that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,

<P>before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter

<P>which she had been meditating over, and say--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing

<P>you were saying.&nbsp; But why be acquainted with us now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can explain this too," cried Mrs Smith, smiling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can you really?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,

<P>and I will shew him as he is now.&nbsp; I cannot produce written proof
again,

<P>but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what

<P>he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.&nbsp; He is no hypocrite
now.

<P>He truly wants to marry you.&nbsp; His present attentions to your family

<P>are very sincere:&nbsp; quite from the heart.&nbsp; I will give you
my authority:

<P>his friend Colonel Wallis."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No.&nbsp; It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;

<P>it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.&nbsp; The stream

<P>is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings

<P>is easily moved away.&nbsp; Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel
Wallis

<P>of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,

<P>in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;

<P>but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom

<P>he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.

<P>She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all

<P>to her nurse; and the nurse&nbsp; knowing my acquaintance with you,

<P>very naturally brings it all to me.&nbsp; On Monday evening, my good
friend

<P>Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.

<P>When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was

<P>not romancing so much as you supposed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.&nbsp; This will not
do.

<P>Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account

<P>for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.

<P>That was all prior to my coming to Bath.&nbsp; I found them on

<P>the most friendly terms when I arrived."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information

<P>in such a line.&nbsp; Facts or opinions which are to pass through the
hands

<P>of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,

<P>can hardly have much truth left."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Only give me a hearing.&nbsp; You will soon be able to judge of

<P>the general credit due, by listening to some particulars

<P>which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.

<P>Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.&nbsp; He had seen
you

<P>indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without

<P>knowing it to be you.&nbsp; So says my historian, at least.&nbsp; Is
this true?

<P>Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,'

<P>to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He certainly did.&nbsp; So far it is very true.&nbsp; At Lyme.

<P>I happened to be at Lyme."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, "grant my friend the credit

<P>due to the establishment of the first point asserted.&nbsp; He saw you
then

<P>at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased

<P>to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,

<P>and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive

<P>in his visits there.&nbsp; But there was another, and an earlier,

<P>which I will now explain.&nbsp; If there is anything in my story which
you know

<P>to be either false or improbable, stop me.&nbsp; My account states,

<P>that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you,

<P>whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir
Walter

<P>as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),

<P>and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,

<P>handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation

<P>and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance,

<P>of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise

<P>that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,

<P>and she continued--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,

<P>long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye

<P>upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then

<P>visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest

<P>in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to
Bath

<P>for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,

<P>Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,

<P>and the reports beginning to prevail.&nbsp; Now you are to understand,

<P>that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions

<P>as to the value of a baronetcy.&nbsp; Upon all points of blood and connexion

<P>he is a completely altered man.&nbsp; Having long had as much money

<P>as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice

<P>or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness

<P>upon the consequence he is heir to.&nbsp; I thought it coming on

<P>before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.

<P>He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.&nbsp; You may guess,

<P>therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be

<P>very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution

<P>of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here

<P>for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,

<P>and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means

<P>of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady

<P>if he found it material.&nbsp; This was agreed upon between the two
friends

<P>as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist

<P>in every way that he could.&nbsp; He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis

<P>was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.

<P>Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,

<P>as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was

<P>his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival

<P>added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.

<P>He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their
way,

<P>called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.

<P>You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,

<P>perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Anne, "you tell me nothing which does not accord with

<P>what I have known, or could imagine.&nbsp; There is always something
offensive

<P>in the details of cunning.&nbsp; The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity

<P>must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises
me.

<P>I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,

<P>who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.

<P>I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.

<P>I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability

<P>of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger

<P>to be lessening or not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lessening, I understand," replied Mrs Smith.&nbsp; "He thinks Mrs Clay

<P>afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed

<P>as she might do in his absence.&nbsp; But since he must be absent

<P>some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure

<P>while she holds her present influence.&nbsp; Mrs Wallis has an amusing
idea,

<P>as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles

<P>when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.

<P>A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;

<P>but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.&nbsp; `Why, to
be sure,

<P>ma'am,' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'

<P>And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,

<P>is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.

<P>She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;

<P>and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have

<P>some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through

<P>Mrs Wallis's recommendation?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very glad to know all this," said Anne, after a little

<P>thoughtfulness.&nbsp; "It will be more painful to me in some respects

<P>to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.

<P>My line of conduct will be more direct.&nbsp; Mr Elliot is evidently

<P>a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had

<P>any better principle to guide him than selfishness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mr Elliot was not done with.&nbsp; Mrs Smith had been carried away

<P>from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest

<P>of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied

<P>against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation

<P>of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,

<P>if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,

<P>proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;

<P>very deficient both in justice and compassion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired

<P>by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together,

<P>and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.

<P>Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender

<P>of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income

<P>had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first

<P>there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.

<P>From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been

<P>a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong

<P>understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,

<P>led by him, and probably despised by him.&nbsp; Mr Elliot, raised by

<P>his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification

<P>of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,

<P>(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),

<P>and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself

<P>to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's

<P>probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and

<P>encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths

<P>accordingly had been ruined.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of
it.

<P>They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship

<P>of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;

<P>but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs

<P>was fully known.&nbsp; With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,

<P>more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had

<P>appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,

<P>and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,

<P>in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been
such

<P>as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to

<P>without corresponding indignation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to

<P>urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same

<P>stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,

<P>under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference

<P>to any of the evils it might bring on her.&nbsp; It was a dreadful picture

<P>of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,

<P>that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.&nbsp; She had a great
deal

<P>to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae

<P>of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been

<P>merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.

<P>Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only

<P>the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's

<P>usual state of mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances

<P>of particular irritation.&nbsp; She had good reason to believe

<P>that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been

<P>for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of

<P>its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;

<P>and this property, though not large, would be enough to make her

<P>comparatively rich.&nbsp; But there was nobody to stir in it.

<P>Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,

<P>equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness,

<P>and from employing others by her want of money.&nbsp; She had no

<P>natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,

<P>and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.

<P>This was a cruel aggravation of actually streightened means.

<P>To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little
trouble

<P>in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be

<P>even weakening her claims, was hard to bear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices

<P>with Mr Elliot.&nbsp; She had previously, in the anticipation

<P>of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;

<P>but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,

<P>since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,

<P>that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman

<P>he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,

<P>as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,

<P>when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed

<P>the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope

<P>of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least

<P>the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not
but

<P>express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably

<P>in the beginning of their conversation.&nbsp; "She had seemed to recommend

<P>and praise him!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear," was Mrs Smith's reply, "there was nothing else to be done.

<P>I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet

<P>have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,

<P>than if he had been your husband.&nbsp; My heart bled for you,

<P>as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,

<P>and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.

<P>He was very unkind to his first wife.&nbsp; They were wretched together.

<P>But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved
her.

<P>I was willing to hope that you must fare better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility

<P>of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea

<P>of the misery which must have followed.&nbsp; It was just possible that

<P>she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!&nbsp; And under such

<P>a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had

<P>disclosed all, too late?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;

<P>and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,

<P>which carried them through the greater part of the morning,

<P>was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend

<P>everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.
