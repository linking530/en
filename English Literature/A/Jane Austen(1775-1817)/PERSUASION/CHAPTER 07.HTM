<P>A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,

<P>and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,

<P>and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,

<P>by the end of another week.&nbsp; It had been a great disappointment

<P>to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,

<P>so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth

<P>under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest

<P>and best in his cellars.&nbsp; But a week must pass; only a week,

<P>in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;

<P>and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,

<P>and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.

<P>She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,

<P>where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,

<P>when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment

<P>brought home in consequence of a bad fall.&nbsp; The child's situation

<P>put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape

<P>with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety

<P>which they afterwards felt on his account.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury

<P>received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.

<P>It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;

<P>the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,

<P>the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,

<P>the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend

<P>and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,

<P>proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession

<P>rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care

<P>of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.

<P>Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were

<P>the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not
where;

<P>but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson

<P>felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words

<P>both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,

<P>and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;

<P>and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts

<P>were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give

<P>the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind

<P>their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted

<P>they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable

<P>they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,

<P>who had been at all a favourite before.&nbsp; How glad they had been

<P>to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said

<P>it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised

<P>in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come

<P>and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;

<P>and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt

<P>all the motive of their attention just as he ought.&nbsp; And in short,

<P>he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,

<P>that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;

<P>and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently

<P>more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls
came

<P>with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;

<P>and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,

<P>could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now

<P>no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to
think

<P>that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little
boy,

<P>to give him the meeting.&nbsp; "Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,"

<P>both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm

<P>to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,

<P>could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;

<P>"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced

<P>to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;

<P>he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour."

<P>But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh! no, indeed,

<P>Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.&nbsp; Only think if anything

<P>should happen?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.

<P>It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been

<P>done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,

<P>and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity

<P>for longer confinement.&nbsp; The child was to be kept in bed and amused

<P>as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?

<P>This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,

<P>who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.&nbsp; His father

<P>very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being

<P>no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his

<P>making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,

<P>of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing can be going on better than the child," said he;

<P>"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me

<P>quite right.&nbsp; Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple
at all.

<P>You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no
use.

<P>Anne will send for me if anything is the matter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.

<P>Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was

<P>quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.

<P>She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,

<P>but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this

<P>poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!

<P>I knew how it would be.&nbsp; This is always my luck.&nbsp; If there
is

<P>anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,

<P>and Charles is as bad as any of them.&nbsp; Very unfeeling!&nbsp; I
must say

<P>it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little
boy.

<P>Talks of his being going on so well!&nbsp; How does he know that he
is

<P>going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour
hence?

<P>I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.&nbsp; So here
he is to

<P>go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,

<P>I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit

<P>than anybody else to be about the child.&nbsp; My being the mother

<P>is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.&nbsp; I am not
at all

<P>equal to it.&nbsp; You saw how hysterical I was yesterday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--

<P>of the shock.&nbsp; You will not be hysterical again.&nbsp; I dare say
we shall have

<P>nothing to distress us.&nbsp; I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions,

<P>and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.

<P>Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.

<P>A sick child is always the mother's property:&nbsp; her own feelings

<P>generally make it so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know

<P>that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,

<P>for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is
ill;

<P>and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,

<P>he was sure to begin kicking about.&nbsp; I have not nerves

<P>for the sort of thing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending

<P>the whole evening away from the poor boy?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?&nbsp; Jemima is so
careful;

<P>and she could send us word every hour how he was.&nbsp; I really think

<P>Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.

<P>I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.

<P>I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,

<P>suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.&nbsp; Leave little
Charles

<P>to my care.&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I
remain

<P>with him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you serious?" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.&nbsp; "Dear me!

<P>that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.&nbsp; To be sure,

<P>I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?

<P>and it only harasses me.&nbsp; You, who have not a mother's feelings,

<P>are a great deal the properest person.&nbsp; You can make little Charles

<P>do anything; he always minds you at a word.&nbsp; It will be a great
deal better

<P>than leaving him only with Jemima.&nbsp; Oh! I shall certainly go;

<P>I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want
me

<P>excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know

<P>you do not mind being left alone.&nbsp; An excellent thought of yours,

<P>indeed, Anne.&nbsp; I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.

<P>You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything

<P>is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.

<P>I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease

<P>about my dear child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,

<P>and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for

<P>the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying,

<P>in a tone of great exultation--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home

<P>than you are.&nbsp; If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,

<P>I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.

<P>Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.

<P>It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be

<P>a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is very kind of Anne," was her husband's answer, "and I should
be

<P>very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be

<P>left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity

<P>of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction

<P>was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being

<P>left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,

<P>when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her

<P>to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;

<P>and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them

<P>set off together in high spirits.&nbsp; They were gone, she hoped,

<P>to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;

<P>as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,

<P>as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.&nbsp; She knew herself to
be

<P>of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her

<P>if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself

<P>agreeable to others?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.

<P>Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.

<P>He must be either indifferent or unwilling.&nbsp; Had he wished

<P>ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;

<P>he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place

<P>she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him

<P>the independence which alone had been wanting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,

<P>and their visit in general.&nbsp; There had been music, singing,

<P>talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners

<P>in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all

<P>to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning

<P>to shoot with Charles.&nbsp; He was to come to breakfast, but not at
the Cottage,

<P>though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed

<P>to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being

<P>in Mrs Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,

<P>somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him

<P>to breakfast at his father's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anne understood it.&nbsp; He wished to avoid seeing her.&nbsp; He had
inquired

<P>after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,

<P>seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,

<P>by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those

<P>of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great

<P>that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when

<P>Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was

<P>come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;

<P>his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth

<P>proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;

<P>and though Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state

<P>as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied

<P>without his running on to give notice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive
him,

<P>while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was

<P>the most consoling, that it would soon be over.&nbsp; And it was soon
over.

<P>In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared;

<P>they were in the drawing-room.&nbsp; Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's,

<P>a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,

<P>said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,

<P>enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons

<P>and voices, but a few minutes ended it.&nbsp; Charles shewed himself

<P>at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,

<P>the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk

<P>to the end of the village with the sportsmen:&nbsp; the room was cleared,

<P>and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is over! it is over!" she repeated to herself again and again,

<P>in nervous gratitude.&nbsp; "The worst is over!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary talked, but she could not attend.&nbsp; She had seen him.

<P>They had met.&nbsp; They had been once more in the same room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling
less.

<P>Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given
up.

<P>How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval

<P>had banished into distance and indistinctness!&nbsp; What might not

<P>eight years do?&nbsp; Events of every description, changes, alienations,

<P>removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--

<P>how natural, how certain too!&nbsp; It included nearly a third part

<P>of her own life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings

<P>eight years may be little more than nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now, how were his sentiments to be read?&nbsp; Was this like

<P>wishing to avoid her?&nbsp; And the next moment she was hating herself

<P>for the folly which asked the question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom

<P>might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;

<P>for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit

<P>at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was

<P>so attentive to me.&nbsp; Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,

<P>when they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not

<P>have known you again.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,

<P>but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar
wound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Altered beyond his knowledge."&nbsp; Anne fully submitted, in silent,

<P>deep mortification.&nbsp; Doubtless it was so, and she could take no
revenge,

<P>for he was not altered, or not for the worse.&nbsp; She had already

<P>acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,

<P>let him think of her as he would.&nbsp; No:&nbsp; the years which had
destroyed

<P>her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,

<P>open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.

<P>She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So altered that he should not have known her again!"&nbsp; These were
words

<P>which could not but dwell with her.&nbsp; Yet she soon began to rejoice

<P>that she had heard them.&nbsp; They were of sobering tendency;

<P>they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must

<P>make her happier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,

<P>but without an idea that they would be carried round to her.

<P>He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,

<P>had spoken as he felt.&nbsp; He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.

<P>She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,

<P>she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,

<P>confident temper could not endure.&nbsp; She had given him up to oblige
others.

<P>It had been the effect of over-persuasion.&nbsp; It had been

<P>weakness and timidity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman
since

<P>whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation

<P>of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.&nbsp; Her power
with him

<P>was gone for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was now his object to marry.&nbsp; He was rich, and being turned
on shore,

<P>fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;

<P>actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed

<P>which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.&nbsp; He had a heart

<P>for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,

<P>in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,

<P>excepting Anne Elliot.&nbsp; This was his only secret exception,

<P>when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.

<P>Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.

<P>A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,

<P>and I am a lost man.&nbsp; Should not this be enough for a sailor,

<P>who has had no society among women to make him nice?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.&nbsp; His bright proud eye

<P>spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was

<P>not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described

<P>the woman he should wish to meet with.&nbsp; "A strong mind,

<P>with sweetness of manner," made the first and the last of the description.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is the woman I want," said he.&nbsp; "Something a little inferior

<P>I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.&nbsp; If I am
a fool,

<P>I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject

<P>more than most men."
