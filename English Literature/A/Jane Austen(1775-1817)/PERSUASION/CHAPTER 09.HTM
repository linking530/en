<P>Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay

<P>as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of

<P>the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's.&nbsp; He had intended,

<P>on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,

<P>and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions

<P>of Uppercross induced him to put this off.&nbsp; There was so much

<P>of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching

<P>in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,

<P>that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all

<P>the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.&nbsp; The Musgroves

<P>could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly

<P>in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral

<P>and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves

<P>in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling
about

<P>in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,

<P>lately added to their establishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth

<P>among the Musgroves and their dependencies.&nbsp; It was unvarying,

<P>warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more

<P>than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,

<P>to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth

<P>very much in the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,

<P>pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been

<P>a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's

<P>introduction.&nbsp; He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,

<P>where residence was not required, lived at his father's house,

<P>only two miles from Uppercross.&nbsp; A short absence from home

<P>had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,

<P>and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,

<P>and of seeing Captain Wentworth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.&nbsp; They had each had money,

<P>but their marriages had made a material difference in

<P>their degree of consequence.&nbsp; Mr Hayter had some property of his
own,

<P>but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while

<P>the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,

<P>the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired,

<P>and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,

<P>have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion

<P>with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen

<P>to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior

<P>in cultivation and manners to all the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no
pride

<P>on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness

<P>of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased

<P>to improve their cousins.&nbsp; Charles's attentions to Henrietta

<P>had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.

<P>"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,"--

<P>and Henrietta did seem to like him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;

<P>but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was

<P>as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.

<P>Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;

<P>and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character

<P>were most likely to attract him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from

<P>an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,

<P>and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything

<P>to take its chance.&nbsp; There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude

<P>or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different

<P>at the Cottage:&nbsp; the young couple there were more disposed

<P>to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above

<P>four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter

<P>had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions

<P>of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.

<P>Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing

<P>that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles "had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what

<P>he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that

<P>he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.

<P>Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance

<P>of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth

<P>was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.

<P>Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word it would," replied Mary.&nbsp; "Dear me!&nbsp; If he should

<P>rise to any very great honours!&nbsp; If he should ever be made a baronet!

<P>`Lady Wentworth' sounds very well.&nbsp; That would be a noble thing,

<P>indeed, for Henrietta!&nbsp; She would take place of me then, and Henrietta

<P>would not dislike that.&nbsp; Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!

<P>It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much

<P>of your new creations."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred

<P>on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished

<P>to see put an end to.&nbsp; She looked down very decidedly upon the
Hayters,

<P>and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection

<P>between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know," said she, "I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;

<P>and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,

<P>she has no right to throw herself away.&nbsp; I do not think any young
woman

<P>has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient

<P>to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections

<P>to those who have not been used to them.&nbsp; And, pray, who is Charles
Hayter?

<P>Nothing but a country curate.&nbsp; A most improper match for Miss Musgrove

<P>of Uppercross.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having

<P>a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,

<P>and he saw things as an eldest son himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary," was therefore his answer.

<P>"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has

<P>a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from

<P>the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,

<P>that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very

<P>pretty property.&nbsp; The estate at Winthrop is not less than

<P>two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,

<P>which is some of the best land in the country.&nbsp; I grant you,

<P>that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,

<P>and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;

<P>but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop

<P>comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,

<P>and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,

<P>he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.&nbsp;
No, no;

<P>Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,

<P>and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Charles may say what he pleases," cried Mary to Anne, as soon as

<P>he was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to have Henrietta

<P>marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse

<P>for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth

<P>may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt

<P>that he has.&nbsp; She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.

<P>I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.&nbsp; And as to

<P>Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense

<P>to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.

<P>But Charles is so positive!&nbsp; I wish you had been with us yesterday,

<P>for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you

<P>would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined

<P>to give it against me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things

<P>should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,

<P>under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return

<P>of indisposition in little Charles.&nbsp; She had thought only of avoiding

<P>Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire

<P>was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence

<P>that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering

<P>the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,

<P>than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.

<P>Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,

<P>good-humoured wife.&nbsp; With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy

<P>which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning

<P>young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings

<P>it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature

<P>of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him

<P>in his cousin's behaviour.&nbsp; She had too old a regard for him

<P>to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish

<P>every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away

<P>from Uppercross:&nbsp; but there was such a change as became very alarming,

<P>when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as

<P>the probable cause.&nbsp; He had been absent only two Sundays,

<P>and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height

<P>of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,

<P>and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.&nbsp; It had then seemed the
object

<P>nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than

<P>forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,

<P>but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed

<P>on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good

<P>as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.

<P>The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going

<P>six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;

<P>of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's

<P>being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through

<P>without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,

<P>but had been almost everything to Henrietta.&nbsp; When he came back,
alas!

<P>the zeal of the business was gone by.&nbsp; Louisa could not listen
at all

<P>to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:

<P>she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta

<P>had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten

<P>all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I am very glad indeed:&nbsp; but I always thought you would have
it;

<P>I always thought you sure.&nbsp; It did not appear to me that--in short,

<P>you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.

<P>Is he coming, Louisa?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,

<P>at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into

<P>the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little

<P>invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,

<P>deprived his manners of their usual composure:&nbsp; he started,

<P>and could only say, "I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:

<P>Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here," before he walked

<P>to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are up stairs with my sister:&nbsp; they will be down in a few
moments,

<P>I dare say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural;

<P>and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,

<P>she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released

<P>Captain Wentworth as well as herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,

<P>"I hope the little boy is better," was silent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there

<P>to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,

<P>when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person

<P>crossing the little vestibule.&nbsp; She hoped, on turning her head,

<P>to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one

<P>much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,

<P>probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth

<P>than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She only attempted to say, "How do you do?&nbsp; Will you not sit down?

<P>The others will be here presently."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently

<P>not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end

<P>to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up

<P>the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another minute brought another addition.&nbsp; The younger boy,

<P>a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the
door

<P>opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance

<P>among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,

<P>and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;

<P>and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,

<P>he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,

<P>busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.

<P>She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.

<P>Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had

<P>the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Walter," said she, "get down this moment.&nbsp; You are extremely troublesome.

<P>I am very angry with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?

<P>Do not you hear your aunt speak?&nbsp; Come to me, Walter, come to

<P>cousin Charles."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But not a bit did Walter stir.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of

<P>being released from him; some one was taking him from her,

<P>though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands

<P>were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,

<P>before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.

<P>She could not even thank him.&nbsp; She could only hang over little
Charles,

<P>with most disordered feelings.&nbsp; His kindness in stepping forward

<P>to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,

<P>the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon

<P>forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,

<P>that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought

<P>to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,

<P>produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,

<P>as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary

<P>and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,

<P>and leave the room.&nbsp; She could not stay.&nbsp; It might have been

<P>an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--

<P>they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.

<P>It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards

<P>Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; She had a strong impression of his having said,

<P>in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's interference,

<P>"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;"

<P>and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do

<P>what he ought to have done himself.&nbsp; But neither Charles Hayter's
feelings,

<P>nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better

<P>arranged her own.&nbsp; She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed

<P>of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,

<P>and it required a long application of solitude and reflection

<P>to recover her.
