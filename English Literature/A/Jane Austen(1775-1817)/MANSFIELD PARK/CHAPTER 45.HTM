<P>At about the week's end from his return to Mansfield,

<P>Tom's immediate danger was over, and he was so far

<P>pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy;

<P>for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering,

<P>helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking

<P>beyond what she heard, with no disposition for alarm

<P>and no aptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest

<P>subject in the world for a little medical imposition.

<P>The fever was subdued; the fever had been his complaint;

<P>of course he would soon be well again.&nbsp; Lady Bertram could

<P>think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt's security,

<P>till she received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely

<P>to give her a clearer idea of his brother's situation,

<P>and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his

<P>father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some

<P>strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the frame

<P>on the departure of the fever.&nbsp; They judged it best

<P>that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which,

<P>it was to be hoped, would prove unfounded; but there was

<P>no reason why Fanny should not know the truth.&nbsp; They were

<P>apprehensive for his lungs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient

<P>and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than

<P>all Lady Bertram's sheets of paper could do.&nbsp; There was

<P>hardly any one in the house who might not have described,

<P>from personal observation, better than herself;

<P>not one who was not more useful at times to her son.

<P>She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him;

<P>but when able to talk or be talked to, or read to,

<P>Edmund was the companion he preferred.&nbsp; His aunt worried

<P>him by her cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down

<P>his conversation or his voice to the level of irritation

<P>and feebleness.&nbsp; Edmund was all in all.&nbsp; Fanny would

<P>certainly believe him so at least, and must find that her

<P>estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared

<P>as the attendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother.

<P>There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist:

<P>there was also, as she now learnt, nerves much affected,

<P>spirits much depressed to calm and raise, and her own

<P>imagination added that there must be a mind to be

<P>properly guided.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined

<P>to hope than fear for her cousin, except when she thought

<P>of Miss Crawford; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea

<P>of being the child of good luck, and to her selfishness

<P>and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was

<P>not forgotten.&nbsp; Edmund's letter had this postscript.

<P>"On the subject of my last, I had actually begun a letter

<P>when called away by Tom's illness, but I have now changed

<P>my mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends.

<P>When Tom is better, I shall go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued,

<P>with scarcely any change, till Easter.&nbsp; A line occasionally

<P>added by Edmund to his mother's letter was enough for

<P>Fanny's information.&nbsp; Tom's amendment was alarmingly slow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most

<P>sorrowfully considered, on first learning that she had

<P>no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it.&nbsp; It came,

<P>and she had yet heard nothing of her return--nothing even

<P>of the going to London, which was to precede her return.

<P>Her aunt often expressed a wish for her, but there was

<P>no notice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended.

<P>She supposed he could not yet leave his son, but it was a cruel,

<P>a terrible delay to her.&nbsp; The end of April was coming on;

<P>it would soon be almost three months, instead of two,

<P>that she had been absent from them all, and that her days

<P>had been passing in a state of penance, which she loved

<P>them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand;

<P>and who could yet say when there might be leisure to think

<P>of or fetch her?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her eagerness, her impatience, her longings to be with them,

<P>were such as to bring a line or two of Cowper's Tirocinium

<P>for ever before her.&nbsp; "With what intense desire she wants

<P>her home," was continually on her tongue, as the truest

<P>description of a yearning which she could not suppose

<P>any schoolboy's bosom to feel more keenly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call

<P>it her home, had been fond of saying that she was going home;

<P>the word had been very dear to her, and so it still was,

<P>but it must be applied to Mansfield.&nbsp; _That_ was now

<P>the home.&nbsp; Portsmouth was Portsmouth; Mansfield was home.

<P>They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her

<P>secret meditations, and nothing was more consolatory

<P>to her than to find her aunt using the same language:

<P>"I cannot but say I much regret your being from home

<P>at this distressing time, so very trying to my spirits.

<P>I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent

<P>from home so long again," were most delightful sentences

<P>to her.&nbsp; Still, however, it was her private regale.

<P>Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray

<P>such a preference of her uncle's house.&nbsp; It was always:

<P>"When I go back into Northamptonshire, or when I return

<P>to Mansfield, I shall do so and so."&nbsp; For a great

<P>while it was so, but at last the longing grew stronger,

<P>it overthrew caution, and she found herself talking of what

<P>she should do when she went home before she was aware.

<P>She reproached herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards

<P>her father and mother.&nbsp; She need not have been uneasy.

<P>There was no sign of displeasure, or even of hearing her.

<P>They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield.

<P>She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring.

<P>She had not known before what pleasures she _had_ to lose

<P>in passing March and April in a town.&nbsp; She had not known

<P>before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation

<P>had delighted her.&nbsp; What animation, both of body and mind,

<P>she had derived from watching the advance of that season

<P>which cannot, in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely,

<P>and seeing its increasing beauties from the earliest

<P>flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt's garden,

<P>to the opening of leaves of her uncle's plantations,

<P>and the glory of his woods.&nbsp; To be losing such pleasures

<P>was no trifle; to be losing them, because she was in

<P>the midst of closeness and noise, to have confinement,

<P>bad air, bad smells, substituted for liberty,

<P>freshness, fragrance, and verdure, was infinitely worse:

<P>but even these incitements to regret were feeble,

<P>compared with what arose from the conviction of being

<P>missed by her best friends, and the longing to be useful

<P>to those who were wanting her!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Could she have been at home, she might have been of service

<P>to every creature in the house.&nbsp; She felt that she must

<P>have been of use to all.&nbsp; To all she must have saved some

<P>trouble of head or hand; and were it only in supporting

<P>the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from the evil

<P>of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless,

<P>officious companion, too apt to be heightening danger

<P>in order to enhance her own importance, her being there

<P>would have been a general good.&nbsp; She loved to fancy how she

<P>could have read to her aunt, how she could have talked

<P>to her, and tried at once to make her feel the blessing

<P>of what was, and prepare her mind for what might be;

<P>and how many walks up and down stairs she might have

<P>saved her, and how many messages she might have carried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It astonished her that Tom's sisters could be satisfied

<P>with remaining in London at such a time, through an

<P>illness which had now, under different degrees of danger,

<P>lasted several weeks.&nbsp; _They_ might return to Mansfield

<P>when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to _them_,

<P>and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away.

<P>If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations,

<P>Julia was certainly able to quit London whenever she chose.

<P>It appeared from one of her aunt's letters that Julia

<P>had offered to return if wanted, but this was all.

<P>It was evident that she would rather remain where she was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London

<P>very much at war with all respectable attachments.

<P>She saw the proof of it in Miss Crawford, as well as in

<P>her cousins; _her_ attachment to Edmund had been respectable,

<P>the most respectable part of her character; her friendship

<P>for herself had at least been blameless.&nbsp; Where was

<P>either sentiment now?&nbsp; It was so long since Fanny had had

<P>any letter from her, that she had some reason to think

<P>lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on.

<P>It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford

<P>or of her other connexions in town, except through Mansfield,

<P>and she was beginning to suppose that she might never

<P>know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again

<P>or not till they met, and might never hear from his

<P>sister any more this spring, when the following letter

<P>was received to revive old and create some new sensations--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my

<P>long silence, and behave as if you could forgive me directly.

<P>This is my modest request and expectation, for you are so good,

<P>that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve,

<P>and I write now to beg an immediate answer.&nbsp; I want to know

<P>the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt,

<P>are perfectly able to give it.&nbsp; One should be a brute not

<P>to feel for the distress they are in; and from what I hear,

<P>poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery.

<P>I thought little of his illness at first.&nbsp; I looked

<P>upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with,

<P>and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder,

<P>and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him;

<P>but now it is confidently asserted that he is really

<P>in a decline, that the symptoms are most alarming,

<P>and that part of the family, at least, are aware of it.

<P>If it be so, I am sure you must be included in that part,

<P>that discerning part, and therefore entreat you to let

<P>me know how far I have been rightly informed.&nbsp; I need

<P>not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been

<P>any mistake, but the report is so prevalent that I confess

<P>I cannot help trembling.&nbsp; To have such a fine young man

<P>cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy.

<P>Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully.&nbsp; I really am quite

<P>agitated on the subject.&nbsp; Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile

<P>and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed

<P>a physician in my life.&nbsp; Poor young man!&nbsp; If he is to die,

<P>there will be _two_ poor young men less in the world;

<P>and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one,

<P>that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands

<P>more deserving of them.&nbsp; It was a foolish precipitation

<P>last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be blotted

<P>out in part.&nbsp; Varnish and gilding hide many stains.

<P>It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name.

<P>With real affection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked.

<P>Write to me by return of post, judge of my anxiety,

<P>and do not trifle with it.&nbsp; Tell me the real truth,

<P>as you have it from the fountainhead.&nbsp; And now, do not

<P>trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or

<P>your own.&nbsp; Believe me, they are not only natural, they are

<P>philanthropic and virtuous.&nbsp; I put it to your conscience,

<P>whether 'Sir Edmund' would not do more good with all

<P>the Bertram property than any other possible 'Sir.'

<P>Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you,

<P>but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth,

<P>his sisters not being within my reach.&nbsp; Mrs. R. has

<P>been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham

<P>(as to be sure you know), and is not yet returned;

<P>and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square,

<P>but I forget their name and street.&nbsp; Could I immediately

<P>apply to either, however, I should still prefer you,

<P>because it strikes me that they have all along been so

<P>unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to shut

<P>their eyes to the truth.&nbsp; I suppose Mrs. R.'s Easter

<P>holidays will not last much longer; no doubt they are

<P>thorough holidays to her.&nbsp; The Aylmers are pleasant people;

<P>and her husband away, she can have nothing but enjoyment.

<P>I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down

<P>to Bath, to fetch his mother; but how will she and the

<P>dowager agree in one house?&nbsp; Henry is not at hand, so I

<P>have nothing to say from him.&nbsp; Do not you think Edmund would

<P>have been in town again long ago, but for this illness?--

<P>Yours ever, Mary."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in,

<P>but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it.

<P>Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended; he saw her this morning:

<P>she returns to Wimpole Street to-day; the old lady is come.

<P>Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies

<P>because he has been spending a few days at Richmond.

<P>He does it every spring.&nbsp; Be assured he cares for nobody

<P>but you.&nbsp; At this very moment he is wild to see you,

<P>and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so,

<P>and for making his pleasure conduce to yours.&nbsp; In proof,

<P>he repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at Portsmouth

<P>about our conveying you home, and I join him in it with all

<P>my soul.&nbsp; Dear Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come.

<P>It will do us all good.&nbsp; He and I can go to the Parsonage,

<P>you know, and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park.

<P>It would really be gratifying to see them all again, and a

<P>little addition of society might be of infinite use to them;

<P>and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted there,

<P>that you cannot in conscience--conscientious as you are--

<P>keep away, when you have the means of returning.

<P>I have not time or patience to give half Henry's messages;

<P>be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is

<P>unalterable affection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's disgust at the greater part of this letter,

<P>with her extreme reluctance to bring the writer of it

<P>and her cousin Edmund together, would have made her (as

<P>she felt) incapable of judging impartially whether

<P>the concluding offer might be accepted or not.

<P>To herself, individually, it was most tempting.&nbsp; To be

<P>finding herself, perhaps within three days, transported

<P>to Mansfield, was an image of the greatest felicity,

<P>but it would have been a material drawback to be owing

<P>such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct,

<P>at the present moment, she saw so much to condemn:

<P>the sister's feelings, the brother's conduct,

<P>_her_ cold-hearted ambition, _his_ thoughtless vanity.

<P>To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps,

<P>of Mrs. Rushworth!&nbsp; She was mortified.&nbsp; She had thought

<P>better of him.&nbsp; Happily, however, she was not left to weigh

<P>and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful

<P>notions of right; there was no occasion to determine

<P>whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not.

<P>She had a rule to apply to, which settled everything.

<P>Her awe of her uncle, and her dread of taking a liberty

<P>with him, made it instantly plain to her what she

<P>had to do.&nbsp; She must absolutely decline the proposal.

<P>If he wanted, he would send for her; and even to offer

<P>an early return was a presumption which hardly anything

<P>would have seemed to justify.&nbsp; She thanked Miss Crawford,

<P>but gave a decided negative.&nbsp; "Her uncle, she understood,

<P>meant to fetch her; and as her cousin's illness had continued

<P>so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary,

<P>she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present,

<P>and that she should be felt an encumbrance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her representation of her cousin's state at this time

<P>was exactly according to her own belief of it, and such

<P>as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her

<P>correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for.

<P>Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed,

<P>under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected,

<P>was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready

<P>to congratulate himself upon.&nbsp; She had only learnt to think

<P>nothing of consequence but money.
