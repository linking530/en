<P>Fanny's consequence increased on the departure of

<P>her cousins.&nbsp; Becoming, as she then did, the only young

<P>woman in the drawing-room, the only occupier of that

<P>interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto

<P>held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not

<P>to be more looked at, more thought of and attended to,

<P>than she had ever been before; and "Where is Fanny?"

<P>became no uncommon question, even without her being

<P>wanted for any one's convenience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not only at home did her value increase, but at the

<P>Parsonage too.&nbsp; In that house, which she had hardly

<P>entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's death, she became

<P>a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirt

<P>of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford.

<P>Her visits there, beginning by chance, were continued

<P>by solicitation.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant, really eager to get any

<P>change for her sister, could, by the easiest self-deceit,

<P>persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing

<P>by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities

<P>of improvement in pressing her frequent calls.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand

<P>by her aunt Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close

<P>to the Parsonage; and being descried from one of the

<P>windows endeavouring to find shelter under the branches

<P>and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises,

<P>was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on

<P>her part, to come in.&nbsp; A civil servant she had withstood;

<P>but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella,

<P>there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed,

<P>and to get into the house as fast as possible; and to poor

<P>Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal

<P>rain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over

<P>the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning,

<P>and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond

<P>themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the sound of

<P>a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss

<P>Price dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful.

<P>The value of an event on a wet day in the country was

<P>most forcibly brought before her.&nbsp; She was all alive

<P>again directly, and among the most active in being useful

<P>to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at

<P>first allow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny,

<P>after being obliged to submit to all this attention,

<P>and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses

<P>and maids, being also obliged, on returning downstairs,

<P>to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while

<P>the rain continued, the blessing of something fresh

<P>to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford,

<P>and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing

<P>and dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant,

<P>that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have

<P>believed herself not in the way, and could she have

<P>foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the

<P>end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having

<P>Dr. Grant's carriage and horses out to take her home,

<P>with which she was threatened.&nbsp; As to anxiety for any alarm

<P>that her absence in such weather might occasion at home,

<P>she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her being

<P>out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly

<P>aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage

<P>aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain,

<P>her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny,

<P>observing a harp in the room, asked some questions about it,

<P>which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very

<P>much to hear it, and a confession, which could hardly

<P>be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its

<P>being in Mansfield.&nbsp; To Fanny herself it appeared a very

<P>simple and natural circumstance.&nbsp; She had scarcely ever

<P>been at the Parsonage since the instrument's arrival,

<P>there had been no reason that she should; but Miss Crawford,

<P>calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject,

<P>was concerned at her own neglect; and "Shall I play

<P>to you now?" and "What will you have?" were questions

<P>immediately following with the readiest good-humour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She played accordingly; happy to have a new listener,

<P>and a listener who seemed so much obliged, so full

<P>of wonder at the performance, and who shewed herself

<P>not wanting in taste.&nbsp; She played till Fanny's eyes,

<P>straying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair,

<P>spoke what she felt must be done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Another quarter of an hour," said Miss Crawford, "and we

<P>shall see how it will be.&nbsp; Do not run away the first

<P>moment of its holding up.&nbsp; Those clouds look alarming."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But they are passed over," said Fanny.&nbsp; "I have been

<P>watching them.&nbsp; This weather is all from the south."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it;

<P>and you must not set forward while it is so threatening.

<P>And besides, I want to play something more to you--a very

<P>pretty piece--and your cousin Edmund's prime favourite.

<P>You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny felt that she must; and though she had not

<P>waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund,

<P>such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea,

<P>and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again,

<P>perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with

<P>constant delight to the favourite air, played, as it

<P>appeared to her, with superior tone and expression;

<P>and though pleased with it herself, and glad to like whatever

<P>was liked by him, she was more sincerely impatient to go

<P>away at the conclusion of it than she had been before;

<P>and on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to

<P>call again, to take them in her walk whenever she could,

<P>to come and hear more of the harp, that she felt it

<P>necessary to be done, if no objection arose at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took

<P>place between them within the first fortnight after

<P>the Miss Bertrams' going away--an intimacy resulting

<P>principally from Miss Crawford's desire of something new,

<P>and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings.

<P>Fanny went to her every two or three days:&nbsp; it seemed a kind

<P>of fascination:&nbsp; she could not be easy without going,

<P>and yet it was without loving her, without ever thinking

<P>like her, without any sense of obligation for being

<P>sought after now when nobody else was to be had;

<P>and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation

<P>than occasional amusement, and _that_ often at the expense

<P>of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on

<P>people or subjects which she wished to be respected.

<P>She went, however, and they sauntered about together

<P>many an half-hour in Mrs. Grant's shrubbery, the weather

<P>being unusually mild for the time of year, and venturing

<P>sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now

<P>comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till,

<P>in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on

<P>the sweets of so protracted an autumn, they were forced,

<P>by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few

<P>yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk for warmth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is pretty, very pretty," said Fanny, looking around

<P>her as they were thus sitting together one day; "every time

<P>I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its

<P>growth and beauty.&nbsp; Three years ago, this was nothing

<P>but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field,

<P>never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything;

<P>and now it is converted into a walk, and it would be

<P>difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience

<P>or an ornament; and perhaps, in another three years,

<P>we may be forgetting--almost forgetting what it was before.

<P>How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time,

<P>and the changes of the human mind!"&nbsp; And following

<P>the latter train of thought, she soon afterwards added:

<P>"If any one faculty of our nature may be called _more_

<P>wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.

<P>There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible

<P>in the powers, the failures, the inequalities

<P>of memory, than in any other of our intelligences.

<P>The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable,

<P>so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak;

<P>and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control!

<P>We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers

<P>of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past

<P>finding out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing

<P>to say; and Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her own

<P>mind to what she thought must interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must

<P>admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this.

<P>There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk!

<P>Not too much attempted!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," replied Miss Crawford carelessly, "it does

<P>very well for a place of this sort.&nbsp; One does not think

<P>of extent _here_; and between ourselves, till I came

<P>to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson

<P>ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!" said Fanny,

<P>in reply.&nbsp; "My uncle's gardener always says the soil here

<P>is better than his own, and so it appears from the growth

<P>of the laurels and evergreens in general.&nbsp; The evergreen!

<P>How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!

<P>When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature!

<P>In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf

<P>is the variety, but that does not make it less amazing

<P>that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants

<P>differing in the first rule and law of their existence.

<P>You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors,

<P>especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt

<P>to get into this sort of wondering strain.&nbsp; One cannot fix

<P>one's eyes on the commonest natural production without

<P>finding food for a rambling fancy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To say the truth," replied Miss Crawford, "I am something

<P>like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.;

<P>and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery

<P>equal to seeing myself in it.&nbsp; If anybody had told

<P>me a year ago that this place would be my home,

<P>that I should be spending month after month here, as I

<P>have done, I certainly should not have believed them.

<P>I have now been here nearly five months; and, moreover,

<P>the quietest five months I ever passed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_Too_ quiet for you, I believe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,"

<P>and her eyes brightened as she spoke, "take it all

<P>and all, I never spent so happy a summer.&nbsp; But then,"

<P>with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, "there is

<P>no saying what it may lead to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal

<P>to surmising or soliciting anything more.&nbsp; Miss Crawford,

<P>however, with renewed animation, soon went on--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country

<P>residence than I had ever expected to be.&nbsp; I can even

<P>suppose it pleasant to spend _half_ the year in the country,

<P>under certain circumstances, very pleasant.&nbsp; An elegant,

<P>moderate-sized house in the centre of family connexions;

<P>continual engagements among them; commanding the first society

<P>in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading

<P>it even more than those of larger fortune, and turning

<P>from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing

<P>worse than a _tete-a-tete_ with the person one feels

<P>most agreeable in the world.&nbsp; There is nothing frightful

<P>in such a picture, is there, Miss Price?&nbsp; One need not

<P>envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _that_."

<P>"Envy Mrs. Rushworth!" was all that Fanny attempted to say.

<P>"Come, come, it would be very un-handsome in us to be

<P>severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I look forward to our owing

<P>her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours.&nbsp; I expect

<P>we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year.

<P>Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing;

<P>for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth's wife must be to

<P>fill her house, and give the best balls in the country."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into

<P>thoughtfulness, till suddenly looking up at the end

<P>of a few minutes, she exclaimed, "Ah! here he is."

<P>It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund,

<P>who then appeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant.

<P>"My sister and Mr. Bertram.&nbsp; I am so glad your eldest

<P>cousin is gone, that he may be Mr. Bertram again.&nbsp; There is

<P>something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram so formal,

<P>so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How differently we feel!" cried Fanny.&nbsp; "To me,

<P>the sound of _Mr._ Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning,

<P>so entirely without warmth or character!&nbsp; It just stands

<P>for a gentleman, and that's all.&nbsp; But there is nobleness

<P>in the name of Edmund.&nbsp; It is a name of heroism and renown;

<P>of kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe

<P>the spirit of chivalry and warm affections."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund

<P>or _Sir_ Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill,

<P>the annihilation of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than

<P>Mr. John or Mr. Thomas.&nbsp; Well, shall we join and disappoint

<P>them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors

<P>at this time of year, by being up before they can begin?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund met them with particular pleasure.&nbsp; It was the

<P>first time of his seeing them together since the beginning

<P>of that better acquaintance which he had been hearing

<P>of with great satisfaction.&nbsp; A friendship between two so

<P>very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:

<P>and to the credit of the lover's understanding, be it stated,

<P>that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only,

<P>or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Miss Crawford, "and do you not scold us for

<P>our imprudence?&nbsp; What do you think we have been sitting

<P>down for but to be talked to about it, and entreated

<P>and supplicated never to do so again?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps I might have scolded," said Edmund, "if either

<P>of you had been sitting down alone; but while you

<P>do wrong together, I can overlook a great deal."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They cannot have been sitting long," cried Mrs. Grant,

<P>"for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the

<P>staircase window, and then they were walking."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And really," added Edmund, "the day is so mild,

<P>that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly

<P>thought imprudent.&nbsp; Our weather must not always be judged

<P>by the calendar.&nbsp; We may sometimes take greater liberties

<P>in November than in May."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word," cried Miss Crawford, "you are two of the most

<P>disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with!

<P>There is no giving you a moment's uneasiness.&nbsp; You do not

<P>know how much we have been suffering, nor what chills

<P>we have felt!&nbsp; But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one

<P>of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre

<P>against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with.

<P>I had very little hope of _him_ from the first; but you,

<P>Mrs. Grant, my sister, my own sister, I think I had a right

<P>to alarm you a little."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary.&nbsp; You have not

<P>the smallest chance of moving me.&nbsp; I have my alarms,

<P>but they are quite in a different quarter; and if I could

<P>have altered the weather, you would have had a good sharp

<P>east wind blowing on you the whole time--for here are

<P>some of my plants which Robert _will_ leave out because

<P>the nights are so mild, and I know the end of it will be,

<P>that we shall have a sudden change of weather, a hard frost

<P>setting in all at once, taking everybody (at least Robert)

<P>by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse,

<P>cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which I

<P>particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday,

<P>because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it

<P>on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep

<P>beyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances,

<P>and make me think the weather most unseasonably close."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!"

<P>said Miss Crawford archly.&nbsp; "Commend me to the nurseryman

<P>and the poulterer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery

<P>of Westminster or St. Paul's, and I should be as glad

<P>of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be.&nbsp; But we

<P>have no such people in Mansfield.&nbsp; What would you have me do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already:

<P>be plagued very often, and never lose your temper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations,

<P>Mary, live where we may; and when you are settled in town

<P>and I come to see you, I dare say I shall find you

<P>with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer,

<P>perhaps on their very account.&nbsp; Their remoteness

<P>and unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds,

<P>will be drawing forth bitter lamentations."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything

<P>of the sort.&nbsp; A large income is the best recipe for

<P>happiness I ever heard of.&nbsp; It certainly may secure

<P>all the myrtle and turkey part of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You intend to be very rich?" said Edmund, with a look which,

<P>to Fanny's eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure.&nbsp; Do not you?&nbsp; Do not we all?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely

<P>beyond my power to command.&nbsp; Miss Crawford may chuse her

<P>degree of wealth.&nbsp; She has only to fix on her number of

<P>thousands a year, and there can be no doubt of their coming.

<P>My intentions are only not to be poor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants

<P>to your income, and all that.&nbsp; I understand you--and a

<P>very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life,

<P>with such limited means and indifferent connexions.

<P>What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance?&nbsp; You have

<P>not much time before you; and your relations are in no

<P>situation to do anything for you, or to mortify you

<P>by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence.

<P>Be honest and poor, by all means--but I shall not

<P>envy you; I do not much think I shall even respect you.

<P>I have a much greater respect for those that are honest

<P>and rich."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor,

<P>is precisely what I have no manner of concern with.

<P>I do not mean to be poor.&nbsp; Poverty is exactly what I have

<P>determined against.&nbsp; Honesty, in the something between,

<P>in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I

<P>am anxious for your not looking down on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher.

<P>I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity

<P>when it might rise to distinction."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But how may it rise?&nbsp; How may my honesty at least rise

<P>to any distinction?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was not so very easy a question to answer,

<P>and occasioned an "Oh!" of some length from the fair lady

<P>before she could add, "You ought to be in parliament,

<P>or you should have gone into the army ten years ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being

<P>in parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an

<P>especial assembly for the representation of younger sons

<P>who have little to live on.&nbsp; No, Miss Crawford," he added,

<P>in a more serious tone, "there _are_ distinctions which I

<P>should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance--

<P>absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining--

<P>but they are of a different character."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed

<P>a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford's side

<P>as she made some laughing answer, was sorrowfull food

<P>for Fanny's observation; and finding herself quite

<P>unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose

<P>side she was now following the others, she had nearly

<P>resolved on going home immediately, and only waited

<P>for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock

<P>at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that she

<P>had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought

<P>the previous self-inquiry of whether she should take

<P>leave or not just then, and how, to a very speedy issue.

<P>With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus;

<P>and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that

<P>his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he

<P>had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's hurry increased; and without in the least expecting

<P>Edmund's attendance, she would have hastened away alone;

<P>but the general pace was quickened, and they all accompanied

<P>her into the house, through which it was necessary to pass.

<P>Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stopt to

<P>speak to him she found, from Edmund's manner, that he

<P>_did_ mean to go with her.&nbsp; He too was taking leave.

<P>She could not but be thankful.&nbsp; In the moment of parting,

<P>Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton

<P>with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for an

<P>unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant,

<P>with sudden recollection, turned to her and asked for the

<P>pleasure of her company too.&nbsp; This was so new an attention,

<P>so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of

<P>Fanny's life, that she was all surprise and embarrassment;

<P>and while stammering out her great obligation, and her

<P>"but she did not suppose it would be in her power,"

<P>was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help.&nbsp; But Edmund,

<P>delighted with her having such an happiness offered,

<P>and ascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence,

<P>that she had no objection but on her aunt's account,

<P>could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty

<P>of sparing her, and therefore gave his decided open advice

<P>that the invitation should be accepted; and though Fanny

<P>would not venture, even on his encouragement, to such

<P>a flight of audacious independence, it was soon settled,

<P>that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant

<P>might expect her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you know what your dinner will be,"

<P>said Mrs. Grant, smiling--"the turkey, and I assure you

<P>a very fine one; for, my dear," turning to her husband,

<P>"cook insists upon the turkey's being dressed to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, very well," cried Dr. Grant, "all the better;

<P>I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house.

<P>But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take

<P>their chance.&nbsp; We none of us want to hear the bill of fare.

<P>A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner, is all we

<P>have in view.&nbsp; A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton,

<P>or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two cousins walked home together; and, except in the

<P>immediate discussion of this engagement, which Edmund

<P>spoke of with the warmest satisfaction, as so particularly

<P>desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with

<P>so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk;

<P>for having finished that subject, he grew thoughtful

<P>and indisposed for any other.
