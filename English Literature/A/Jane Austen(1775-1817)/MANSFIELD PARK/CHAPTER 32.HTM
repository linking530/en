<P>Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she

<P>awoke the next morning; but she remembered the purport

<P>of her note, and was not less sanguine as to its effect

<P>than she had been the night before.&nbsp; If Mr. Crawford would

<P>but go away!&nbsp; That was what she most earnestly desired:

<P>go and take his sister with him, as he was to do,

<P>and as he returned to Mansfield on purpose to do.

<P>And why it was not done already she could not devise,

<P>for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay.&nbsp; Fanny had hoped,

<P>in the course of his yesterday's visit, to hear the day named;

<P>but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take

<P>place ere long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note

<P>would convey, she could not but be astonished to see

<P>Mr. Crawford, as she accidentally did, coming up to the

<P>house again, and at an hour as early as the day before.

<P>His coming might have nothing to do with her, but she

<P>must avoid seeing him if possible; and being then

<P>on her way upstairs, she resolved there to remain,

<P>during the whole of his visit, unless actually sent for;

<P>and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house, there seemed

<P>little danger of her being wanted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening,

<P>trembling, and fearing to be sent for every moment;

<P>but as no footsteps approached the East room, she grew

<P>gradually composed, could sit down, and be able to

<P>employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come

<P>and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the

<P>matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing

<P>very comfortable, when suddenly the sound of a step

<P>in regular approach was heard; a heavy step, an unusual

<P>step in that part of the house:&nbsp; it was her uncle's;

<P>she knew it as well as his voice; she had trembled at it

<P>as often, and began to tremble again, at the idea of his

<P>coming up to speak to her, whatever might be the subject.

<P>It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and asked

<P>if she were there, and if he might come in.&nbsp; The terror

<P>of his former occasional visits to that room seemed

<P>all renewed, and she felt as if he were going to examine

<P>her again in French and English.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him,

<P>and trying to appear honoured; and, in her agitation,

<P>had quite overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment, till he,

<P>stopping short as he entered, said, with much surprise,

<P>"Why have you no fire to-day?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl.

<P>She hesitated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not cold, sir:&nbsp; I never sit here long at this time

<P>of year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you have a fire in general?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How comes this about?&nbsp; Here must be some mistake.

<P>I understood that you had the use of this room by way

<P>of making you perfectly comfortable.&nbsp; In your bedchamber

<P>I know you _cannot_ have a fire.&nbsp; Here is some great

<P>misapprehension which must be rectified.&nbsp; It is highly

<P>unfit for you to sit, be it only half an hour a day,

<P>without a fire.&nbsp; You are not strong.&nbsp; You are chilly.

<P>Your aunt cannot be aware of this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged

<P>to speak, she could not forbear, in justice to the aunt

<P>she loved best, from saying something in which the words

<P>"my aunt Norris" were distinguishable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I understand," cried her uncle, recollecting himself,

<P>and not wanting to hear more:&nbsp; "I understand.&nbsp; Your aunt

<P>Norris has always been an advocate, and very judiciously,

<P>for young people's being brought up without unnecessary

<P>indulgences; but there should be moderation in everything.

<P>She is also very hardy herself, which of course will

<P>influence her in her opinion of the wants of others.

<P>And on another account, too, I can perfectly comprehend.

<P>I know what her sentiments have always been.

<P>The principle was good in itself, but it may have been,

<P>and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case.

<P>I am aware that there has been sometimes, in some points,

<P>a misplaced distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny,

<P>to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account.

<P>You have an understanding which will prevent you from

<P>receiving things only in part, and judging partially

<P>by the event.&nbsp; You will take in the whole of the past,

<P>you will consider times, persons, and probabilities,

<P>and you will feel that _they_ were not least your

<P>friends who were educating and preparing you for that

<P>mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot.

<P>Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary,

<P>it was kindly meant; and of this you may be assured,

<P>that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little

<P>privations and restrictions that may have been imposed.

<P>I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you,

<P>by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris

<P>with the respect and attention that are due to her.

<P>But enough of this.&nbsp; Sit down, my dear.&nbsp; I must speak

<P>to you for a few minutes, but I will not detain

<P>you long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising.

<P>After a moment's pause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress

<P>a smile, went on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor

<P>this morning.&nbsp; I had not been long in my own room,

<P>after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford was shewn in.

<P>His errand you may probably conjecture."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle,

<P>perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that

<P>made either speaking or looking up quite impossible,

<P>turned away his own eyes, and without any farther pause

<P>proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford's visit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford's business had been to declare himself

<P>the lover of Fanny, make decided proposals for her,

<P>and entreat the sanction of the uncle, who seemed to stand

<P>in the place of her parents; and he had done it all so well,

<P>so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas,

<P>feeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks

<P>to have been very much to the purpose, was exceedingly

<P>happy to give the particulars of their conversation;

<P>and little aware of what was passing in his niece's mind,

<P>conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her

<P>far more than himself.&nbsp; He talked, therefore, for several

<P>minutes without Fanny's daring to interrupt him.

<P>She had hardly even attained the wish to do it.&nbsp; Her mind

<P>was in too much confusion.&nbsp; She had changed her position;

<P>and, with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows,

<P>was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation

<P>and dismay.&nbsp; For a moment he ceased, but she had barely

<P>become conscious of it, when, rising from his chair, he said,

<P>"And now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission,

<P>and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured

<P>and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by prevailing

<P>on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot

<P>but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself,

<P>I must submit to your finding one still better worth

<P>listening to.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen,

<P>is yet in the house.&nbsp; He is in my room, and hoping to see

<P>you there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this,

<P>which astonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of

<P>astonishment on hearing her exclaim--"Oh! no, sir, I cannot,

<P>indeed I cannot go down to him.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford ought to know--

<P>he must know that:&nbsp; I told him enough yesterday to convince him;

<P>he spoke to me on this subject yesterday, and I told him

<P>without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me,

<P>and quite out of my power to return his good opinion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not catch your meaning," said Sir Thomas, sitting

<P>down again.&nbsp; "Out of your power to return his good opinion?

<P>What is all this?&nbsp; I know he spoke to you yesterday,

<P>and (as far as I understand) received as much encouragement

<P>to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit

<P>herself to give.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with what I

<P>collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion;

<P>it shewed a discretion highly to be commended.&nbsp; But now,

<P>when he has made his overtures so properly, and honourably--

<P>what are your scruples _now_?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are mistaken, sir," cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety

<P>of the moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong;

<P>"you are quite mistaken.&nbsp; How could Mr. Crawford say

<P>such a thing?&nbsp; I gave him no encouragement yesterday.

<P>On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollect my exact words,

<P>but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him,

<P>that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that

<P>I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again.

<P>I am sure I said as much as that and more; and I should

<P>have said still more, if I had been quite certain of his

<P>meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be,

<P>I could not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended.

<P>I thought it might all pass for nothing with _him_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could say no more; her breath was almost gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Am I to understand," said Sir Thomas, after a few moments'

<P>silence, "that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Refuse him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Refuse Mr. Crawford!&nbsp; Upon what plea?&nbsp; For what reason?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I--I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is very strange!" said Sir Thomas, in a voice of

<P>calm displeasure.&nbsp; "There is something in this which my

<P>comprehension does not reach.&nbsp; Here is a young man wishing

<P>to pay his addresses to you, with everything to recommend him:

<P>not merely situation in life, fortune, and character,

<P>but with more than common agreeableness, with address

<P>and conversation pleasing to everybody.&nbsp; And he is not an

<P>acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time.

<P>His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has

<P>been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose

<P>would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you,

<P>had there been no other.&nbsp; It is very uncertain when my

<P>interest might have got William on.&nbsp; He has done it already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down

<P>with fresh shame; and she did feel almost ashamed

<P>of herself, after such a picture as her uncle had drawn,

<P>for not liking Mr. Crawford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must have been aware," continued Sir Thomas presently,

<P>"you must have been some time aware of a particularity

<P>in Mr. Crawford's manners to you.&nbsp; This cannot have taken

<P>you by surprise.&nbsp; You must have observed his attentions;

<P>and though you always received them very properly (I have

<P>no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them

<P>to be unpleasant to you.&nbsp; I am half inclined to think,

<P>Fanny, that you do not quite know your own feelings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes, sir! indeed I do.&nbsp; His attentions were always--

<P>what I did not like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise.

<P>"This is beyond me," said he.&nbsp; "This requires explanation.

<P>Young as you are, and having seen scarcely any one,

<P>it is hardly possible that your affections--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused and eyed her fixedly.&nbsp; He saw her lips

<P>formed into a _no_, though the sound was inarticulate,

<P>but her face was like scarlet.&nbsp; That, however, in so

<P>modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;

<P>and chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added,

<P>"No, no, I know _that_ is quite out of the question;

<P>quite impossible.&nbsp; Well, there is nothing more to be said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And for a few minutes he did say nothing.&nbsp; He was deep

<P>in thought.&nbsp; His niece was deep in thought likewise, trying to

<P>harden and prepare herself against farther questioning.

<P>She would rather die than own the truth; and she hoped,

<P>by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond

<P>betraying it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford's _choice_

<P>seemed to justify" said Sir Thomas, beginning again,

<P>and very composedly, "his wishing to marry at all so

<P>early is recommendatory to me.&nbsp; I am an advocate for

<P>early marriages, where there are means in proportion,

<P>and would have every young man, with a sufficient income,

<P>settle as soon after four-and-twenty as he can.&nbsp; This is

<P>so much my opinion, that I am sorry to think how little

<P>likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr. Bertram,

<P>is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,

<P>matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts.

<P>I wish he were more likely to fix."&nbsp; Here was a glance

<P>at Fanny.&nbsp; "Edmund, I consider, from his dispositions

<P>and habits, as much more likely to marry early than

<P>his brother.&nbsp; _He_, indeed, I have lately thought,

<P>has seen the woman he could love, which, I am convinced,

<P>my eldest son has not.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp; Do you agree with me,

<P>my dear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was

<P>easy on the score of the cousins.&nbsp; But the removal of his

<P>alarm did his niece no service:&nbsp; as her unaccountableness

<P>was confirmed his displeasure increased; and getting up

<P>and walking about the room with a frown, which Fanny could

<P>picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her eyes,

<P>he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said,

<P>"Have you any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford's

<P>temper?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She longed to add, "But of his principles I have"; but her

<P>heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion,

<P>explanation, and probably non-conviction. Her ill opinion

<P>of him was founded chiefly on observations, which,

<P>for her cousins' sake, she could scarcely dare mention

<P>to their father.&nbsp; Maria and Julia, and especially Maria,

<P>were so closely implicated in Mr. Crawford's misconduct,

<P>that she could not give his character, such as she

<P>believed it, without betraying them.&nbsp; She had hoped that,

<P>to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so honourable,

<P>so good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_

<P>on her side would have been sufficient.&nbsp; To her infinite

<P>grief she found it was not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat

<P>in trembling wretchedness, and with a good deal of

<P>cold sternness, said, "It is of no use, I perceive,

<P>to talk to you.&nbsp; We had better put an end to this

<P>most mortifying conference.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford must not be

<P>kept longer waiting.&nbsp; I will, therefore, only add,

<P>as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct,

<P>that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed,

<P>and proved yourself of a character the very reverse

<P>of what I had supposed.&nbsp; For I _had_, Fanny, as I think

<P>my behaviour must have shewn, formed a very favourable

<P>opinion of you from the period of my return to England.

<P>I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper,

<P>self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence

<P>of spirit which prevails so much in modern days,

<P>even in young women, and which in young women is offensive

<P>and disgusting beyond all common offence.&nbsp; But you

<P>have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse;

<P>that you can and will decide for yourself, without any

<P>consideration or deference for those who have surely some

<P>right to guide you, without even asking their advice.

<P>You have shewn yourself very, very different from anything

<P>that I had imagined.&nbsp; The advantage or disadvantage of

<P>your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters,

<P>never seems to have had a moment's share in your thoughts

<P>on this occasion.&nbsp; How _they_ might be benefited,

<P>how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment for you,

<P>is nothing to _you_.&nbsp; You think only of yourself,

<P>and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a

<P>young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness,

<P>you resolve to refuse him at once, without wishing

<P>even for a little time to consider of it, a little more

<P>time for cool consideration, and for really examining

<P>your own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly,

<P>throwing away from you such an opportunity of being

<P>settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly settled,

<P>as will, probably, never occur to you again.&nbsp; Here is a

<P>young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners,

<P>and of fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking

<P>your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way;

<P>and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may live eighteen years

<P>longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half

<P>Mr. Crawford's estate, or a tenth part of his merits.

<P>Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters

<P>on him.&nbsp; Maria is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford

<P>sought Julia's hand, I should have given it to him with

<P>superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave

<P>Maria's to Mr. Rushworth."&nbsp; After half a moment's pause:

<P>"And I should have been very much surprised had either

<P>of my daughters, on receiving a proposal of marriage at any

<P>time which might carry with it only _half_ the eligibility

<P>of _this_, immediately and peremptorily, and without paying

<P>my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation,

<P>put a decided negative on it.&nbsp; I should have been much

<P>surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding.&nbsp; I should

<P>have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect.

<P>_You_ are not to be judged by the same rule.&nbsp; You do not

<P>owe me the duty of a child.&nbsp; But, Fanny, if your heart

<P>can acquit you of _ingratitude_--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ceased.&nbsp; Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that,

<P>angry as he was, he would not press that article farther.

<P>Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what

<P>she appeared to him; by such accusations, so heavy,

<P>so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!

<P>Self-willed, obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful.

<P>He thought her all this.&nbsp; She had deceived his expectations;

<P>she had lost his good opinion.&nbsp; What was to become

<P>of her?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very sorry," said she inarticulately, through her tears,

<P>"I am very sorry indeed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably

<P>have reason to be long sorry for this day's transactions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If it were possible for me to do otherwise" said she,

<P>with another strong effort; "but I am so perfectly

<P>convinced that I could never make him happy, and that I

<P>should be miserable myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst,

<P>and in spite of that great black word _miserable_,

<P>which served to introduce it, Sir Thomas began to think

<P>a little relenting, a little change of inclination,

<P>might have something to do with it; and to augur favourably

<P>from the personal entreaty of the young man himself.

<P>He knew her to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous;

<P>and thought it not improbable that her mind might be

<P>in such a state as a little time, a little pressing,

<P>a little patience, and a little impatience, a judicious

<P>mixture of all on the lover's side, might work their

<P>usual effect on.&nbsp; If the gentleman would but persevere,

<P>if he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began

<P>to have hopes; and these reflections having passed across

<P>his mind and cheered it, "Well," said he, in a tone

<P>of becoming gravity, but of less anger, "well, child,

<P>dry up your tears.&nbsp; There is no use in these tears;

<P>they can do no good.&nbsp; You must now come downstairs with me.

<P>Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already.

<P>You must give him your own answer:&nbsp; we cannot expect him

<P>to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him

<P>the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments, which,

<P>unfortunately for himself, he certainly has imbibed.&nbsp; I am

<P>totally unequal to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the

<P>idea of going down to him, that Sir Thomas, after a

<P>little consideration, judged it better to indulge her.

<P>His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small

<P>depression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece,

<P>and saw the state of feature and complexion which her

<P>crying had brought her into, he thought there might

<P>be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview.

<P>With a few words, therefore, of no particular meaning,

<P>he walked off by himself, leaving his poor niece to sit

<P>and cry over what had passed, with very wretched feelings
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her mind was all disorder.&nbsp; The past, present, future,

<P>everything was terrible.&nbsp; But her uncle's anger gave

<P>her the severest pain of all.&nbsp; Selfish and ungrateful!

<P>to have appeared so to him!&nbsp; She was miserable for ever.

<P>She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak

<P>for her.&nbsp; Her only friend was absent.&nbsp; He might have

<P>softened his father; but all, perhaps all, would think

<P>her selfish and ungrateful.&nbsp; She might have to endure

<P>the reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see it,

<P>or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her.

<P>She could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford;

<P>yet, if he really loved her, and were unhappy too!

<P>It was all wretchedness together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned;

<P>she was almost ready to faint at the sight of him.

<P>He spoke calmly, however, without austerity, without reproach,

<P>and she revived a little.&nbsp; There was comfort, too,

<P>in his words, as well as his manner, for he began with,

<P>"Mr. Crawford is gone:&nbsp; he has just left me.&nbsp; I need not

<P>repeat what has passed.&nbsp; I do not want to add to anything

<P>you may now be feeling, by an account of what he has felt.

<P>Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike

<P>and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most

<P>favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper.

<P>Upon my representation of what you were suffering,

<P>he immediately, and with the greatest delicacy,

<P>ceased to urge to see you for the present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again.&nbsp; "Of course,"

<P>continued her uncle, "it cannot be supposed but that he should

<P>request to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes;

<P>a request too natural, a claim too just to be denied.

<P>But there is no time fixed; perhaps to-morrow, or whenever

<P>your spirits are composed enough.&nbsp; For the present you

<P>have only to tranquillise yourself.&nbsp; Check these tears;

<P>they do but exhaust you.&nbsp; If, as I am willing to suppose,

<P>you wish to shew me any observance, you will not give

<P>way to these emotions, but endeavour to reason yourself

<P>into a stronger frame of mind.&nbsp; I advise you to go out:

<P>the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the gravel;

<P>you will have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the

<P>better for air and exercise.&nbsp; And, Fanny" (turning back

<P>again for a moment), "I shall make no mention below of

<P>what has passed; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram.

<P>There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment;

<P>say nothing about it yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was

<P>an act of kindness which Fanny felt at her heart.

<P>To be spared from her aunt Norris's interminable

<P>reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude.

<P>Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches.

<P>Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She walked out directly, as her uncle recommended,

<P>and followed his advice throughout, as far as she could;

<P>did check her tears; did earnestly try to compose her spirits

<P>and strengthen her mind.&nbsp; She wished to prove to him that she

<P>did desire his comfort, and sought to regain his favour;

<P>and he had given her another strong motive for exertion,

<P>in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts.

<P>Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now

<P>an object worth attaining; and she felt equal to almost

<P>anything that might save her from her aunt Norris.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her

<P>walk and going into the East room again, the first thing

<P>which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning.

<P>A fire! it seemed too much; just at that time to be giving

<P>her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude.

<P>She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think

<P>of such a trifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary

<P>information of the housemaid, who came in to attend it,

<P>that so it was to be every day.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had given

<P>orders for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!"

<P>said she, in soliloquy.&nbsp; "Heaven defend me from

<P>being ungrateful!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris,

<P>till they met at dinner.&nbsp; Her uncle's behaviour to her

<P>was then as nearly as possible what it had been before;

<P>she was sure he did not mean there should be any change,

<P>and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any;

<P>but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when she

<P>found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked

<P>out without her aunt's knowledge could be dwelt on,

<P>she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness

<P>which saved her from the same spirit of reproach,

<P>exerted on a more momentous subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I had known you were going out, I should have got you

<P>just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny,"

<P>said she, "which I have since, to my very great inconvenience,

<P>been obliged to go and carry myself.&nbsp; I could very ill

<P>spare the time, and you might have saved me the trouble,

<P>if you would only have been so good as to let us know you

<P>were going out.&nbsp; It would have made no difference to you,

<P>I suppose, whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone

<P>to my house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,"

<P>said Sir Thomas.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!" said Mrs. Norris, with a moment's check,

<P>"that was very kind of you, Sir Thomas; but you do not

<P>know how dry the path is to my house.&nbsp; Fanny would have

<P>had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the

<P>advantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt:

<P>it is all her fault.&nbsp; If she would but have let us know

<P>she was going out but there is a something about Fanny,

<P>I have often observed it before--she likes to go her

<P>own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to;

<P>she takes her own independent walk whenever she can;

<P>she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy, and independence,

<P>and nonsense, about her, which I would advise her to get

<P>the better of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought

<P>nothing could be more unjust, though he had been so lately

<P>expressing the same sentiments himself, and he tried to turn

<P>the conversation:&nbsp; tried repeatedly before he could succeed;

<P>for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive,

<P>either now, or at any other time, to what degree he

<P>thought well of his niece, or how very far he was from

<P>wishing to have his own children's merits set off by

<P>the depreciation of hers.&nbsp; She was talking _at_ Fanny,

<P>and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with

<P>more composure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits

<P>than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning;

<P>but she trusted, in the first place, that she had done right:

<P>that her judgment had not misled her.&nbsp; For the purity

<P>of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing

<P>to hope, secondly, that her uncle's displeasure was abating,

<P>and would abate farther as he considered the matter with

<P>more impartiality, and felt, as a good man must feel,

<P>how wretched, and how unpardonable, how hopeless,

<P>and how wicked it was to marry without affection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the meeting with which she was threatened for the

<P>morrow was past, she could not but flatter herself that

<P>the subject would be finally concluded, and Mr. Crawford

<P>once gone from Mansfield, that everything would soon

<P>be as if no such subject had existed.&nbsp; She would not,

<P>could not believe, that Mr. Crawford's affection for her

<P>could distress him long; his mind was not of that sort.

<P>London would soon bring its cure.&nbsp; In London he would

<P>soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and be thankful

<P>for the right reason in her which had saved him from its

<P>evil consequences.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While Fanny's mind was engaged in these sort of hopes,

<P>her uncle was, soon after tea, called out of the room;

<P>an occurrence too common to strike her, and she thought nothing

<P>of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards,

<P>and advancing decidedly towards herself, said, "Sir Thomas

<P>wishes to speak with you, ma'am, in his own room."

<P>Then it occurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion

<P>rushed over her mind which drove the colour from her cheeks;

<P>but instantly rising, she was preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris

<P>called out, "Stay, stay, Fanny! what are you about? where

<P>are you going? don't be in such a hurry.&nbsp; Depend upon it,

<P>it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me"

<P>(looking at the butler); "but you are so very eager to put

<P>yourself forward.&nbsp; What should Sir Thomas want you for?

<P>It is me, Baddeley, you mean; I am coming this moment.

<P>You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir Thomas wants me,

<P>not Miss Price."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Baddeley was stout.&nbsp; "No, ma'am, it is Miss Price;

<P>I am certain of its being Miss Price."&nbsp; And there was

<P>a half-smile with the words, which meant, "I do not think

<P>you would answer the purpose at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose

<P>herself to work again; and Fanny, walking off in

<P>agitating consciousness, found herself, as she anticipated,

<P>in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.
