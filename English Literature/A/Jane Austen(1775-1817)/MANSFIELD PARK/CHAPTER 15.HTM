<P>Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after

<P>Miss Bertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth

<P>arrived, and another character was consequently cast.

<P>He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt, and at first

<P>did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss Bertram

<P>to direct him; but upon being made to understand the

<P>different style of the characters, and which was which,

<P>and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London,

<P>and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow, he soon

<P>decided for the Count.&nbsp; Miss Bertram approved the decision,

<P>for the less he had to learn the better; and though she

<P>could not sympathise in his wish that the Count and

<P>Agatha might be to act together, nor wait very patiently

<P>while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope

<P>of still discovering such a scene, she very kindly took

<P>his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted

<P>being shortened; besides pointing out the necessity

<P>of his being very much dressed, and chusing his colours.

<P>Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well,

<P>though affecting to despise it; and was too much

<P>engaged with what his own appearance would be to think

<P>of the others, or draw any of those conclusions, or feel

<P>any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all

<P>the morning, knew anything of the matter; but when he

<P>entered the drawing-room before dinner, the buzz of

<P>discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates;

<P>and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity

<P>to tell him the agreeable news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have got a play," said he.&nbsp; "It is to be Lovers'

<P>Vows; and I am to be Count Cassel, and am to come

<P>in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak,

<P>and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit,

<P>by way of a shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him

<P>as she heard this speech, and saw his look, and felt

<P>what his sensations must be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lovers' Vows!" in a tone of the greatest amazement,

<P>was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth, and he turned

<P>towards his brother and sisters as if hardly doubting

<P>a contradiction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," cried Mr. Yates.&nbsp; "After all our debatings

<P>and difficulties, we find there is nothing that will

<P>suit us altogether so well, nothing so unexceptionable,

<P>as Lovers' Vows.&nbsp; The wonder is that it should not have been

<P>thought of before.&nbsp; My stupidity was abominable, for here

<P>we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford;

<P>and it is so useful to have anything of a model!

<P>We have cast almost every part."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But what do you do for women?" said Edmund gravely,

<P>and looking at Maria.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered,

<P>"I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done,

<P>and" (with a bolder eye) "Miss Crawford is to be Amelia."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so

<P>easily filled up, with _us_," replied Edmund, turning away

<P>to the fire, where sat his mother, aunt, and Fanny,

<P>and seating himself with a look of great vexation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Rushworth followed him to say, "I come in three times,

<P>and have two-and-forty speeches.&nbsp; That's something,

<P>is not it?&nbsp; But I do not much like the idea of being so fine.

<P>I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink

<P>satin cloak."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund could not answer him.&nbsp; In a few minutes Mr. Bertram

<P>was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts

<P>of the carpenter; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates,

<P>and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth, Edmund almost

<P>immediately took the opportunity of saying, "I cannot,

<P>before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play,

<P>without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford;

<P>but I must now, my dear Maria, tell _you_, that I

<P>think it exceedingly unfit for private representation,

<P>and that I hope you will give it up.&nbsp; I cannot but suppose

<P>you _will_ when you have read it carefully over.

<P>Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt,

<P>and see how you can approve it.&nbsp; It will not be necessary

<P>to send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We see things very differently," cried Maria.

<P>"I am perfectly acquainted with the play, I assure you;

<P>and with a very few omissions, and so forth, which will

<P>be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it;

<P>and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who thinks

<P>it very fit for private representation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry for it," was his answer; "but in this matter

<P>it is _you_ who are to lead.&nbsp; _You_ must set the example.

<P>If others have blundered, it is your place to put

<P>them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.

<P>In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law

<P>to the rest of the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no

<P>one loved better to lead than Maria; and with far more

<P>good-humour she answered, "I am much obliged to you, Edmund;

<P>you mean very well, I am sure:&nbsp; but I still think you

<P>see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake

<P>to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind.

<P>_There_ would be the greatest indecorum, I think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in

<P>my head?&nbsp; No; let your conduct be the only harangue.

<P>Say that, on examining the part, you feel yourself

<P>unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion

<P>and confidence than you can be supposed to have.

<P>Say this with firmness, and it will be quite enough.

<P>All who can distinguish will understand your motive.

<P>The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as

<P>it ought."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not act anything improper, my dear," said Lady Bertram.

<P>"Sir Thomas would not like it.--Fanny, ring the bell;

<P>I must have my dinner.--To be sure, Julia is dressed by

<P>this time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am convinced, madam," said Edmund, preventing Fanny,

<P>"that Sir Thomas would not like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I were to decline the part," said Maria,

<P>with renewed zeal, "Julia would certainly take it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!" cried Edmund, "if she knew your reasons!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! she might think the difference between us--

<P>the difference in our situations--that _she_ need

<P>not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel necessary.

<P>I am sure she would argue so.&nbsp; No; you must excuse me;

<P>I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled,

<P>everybody would be so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry;

<P>and if we are so very nice, we shall never act anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was just going to say the very same thing," said Mrs. Norris.

<P>"If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing,

<P>and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away,

<P>and I am sure _that_ would be a discredit to us all.

<P>I do not know the play; but, as Maria says, if there

<P>is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most

<P>of them) it can be easily left out.&nbsp; We must not be

<P>over-precise, Edmund.&nbsp; As Mr. Rushworth is to act too,

<P>there can be no harm.&nbsp; I only wish Tom had known his own

<P>mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss

<P>of half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain

<P>will be a good job, however.&nbsp; The maids do their work

<P>very well, and I think we shall be able to send back

<P>some dozens of the rings.&nbsp; There is no occasion to put

<P>them so very close together.&nbsp; I _am_ of some use, I hope,

<P>in preventing waste and making the most of things.

<P>There should always be one steady head to superintend

<P>so many young ones.&nbsp; I forgot to tell Tom of something

<P>that happened to me this very day.&nbsp; I had been looking

<P>about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out,

<P>when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up

<P>to the servants' hall-door with two bits of deal board

<P>in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure;

<P>mother had chanced to send him of a message to father,

<P>and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board,

<P>for he could not no how do without them.&nbsp; I knew what all

<P>this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell was ringing

<P>at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate such

<P>encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching,

<P>I have always said so:&nbsp; just the sort of people to get

<P>all they can), I said to the boy directly (a great lubberly

<P>fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought to be ashamed

<P>of himself), "_I'll_ take the boards to your father,

<P>Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can."

<P>The boy looked very silly, and turned away without

<P>offering a word, for I believe I might speak pretty sharp;

<P>and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding

<P>about the house for one while.&nbsp; I hate such greediness--

<P>so good as your father is to the family, employing the man

<P>all the year round!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others

<P>soon returned; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured

<P>to set them right must be his only satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dinner passed heavily.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris related again

<P>her triumph over Dick Jackson, but neither play nor

<P>preparation were otherwise much talked of, for Edmund's

<P>disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he

<P>would not have owned it.&nbsp; Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's

<P>animating support, thought the subject better avoided.

<P>Mr. Yates, who was trying to make himself agreeable to Julia,

<P>found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than

<P>that of his regret at her secession from their company;

<P>and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own

<P>dress in his head, had soon talked away all that could

<P>be said of either.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an

<P>hour or two:&nbsp; there was still a great deal to be settled;

<P>and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria,

<P>and Mr. Yates, soon after their being reassembled

<P>in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee

<P>at a separate table, with the play open before them,

<P>and were just getting deep in the subject when a most

<P>welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and

<P>Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it was,

<P>could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful

<P>joy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, how do you go on?" and "What have you settled?"

<P>and "Oh! we can do nothing without you," followed the

<P>first salutations; and Henry Crawford was soon seated

<P>with the other three at the table, while his sister made

<P>her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention

<P>was complimenting _her_.&nbsp; "I must really congratulate

<P>your ladyship," said she, "on the play being chosen;

<P>for though you have borne it with exemplary patience, I am

<P>sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties.

<P>The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be infinitely

<P>more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give

<P>you joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else

<P>who is in the same predicament," glancing half fearfully,

<P>half slyly, beyond Fanny to Edmund.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram,

<P>but Edmund said nothing.&nbsp; His being only a bystander was

<P>not disclaimed.&nbsp; After continuing in chat with the party

<P>round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned

<P>to the party round the table; and standing by them,

<P>seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till,

<P>as if struck by a sudden recollection, she exclaimed,

<P>"My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon

<P>these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let

<P>me know my fate in the meanwhile.&nbsp; Who is to be Anhalt?

<P>What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making

<P>love to?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together

<P>to tell the same melancholy truth, that they had not yet

<P>got any Anhalt.&nbsp; "Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel,

<P>but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had my choice of the parts," said Mr. Rushworth;

<P>"but I thought I should like the Count best, though I do

<P>not much relish the finery I am to have."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You chose very wisely, I am sure," replied Miss Crawford,

<P>with a brightened look; "Anhalt is a heavy part."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,"

<P>returned Mr. Rushworth, "which is no trifle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not at all surprised," said Miss Crawford,

<P>after a short pause, "at this want of an Anhalt.

<P>Amelia deserves no better.&nbsp; Such a forward young lady

<P>may well frighten the men."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it

<P>were possible," cried Tom; "but, unluckily, the Butler

<P>and Anhalt are in together.&nbsp; I will not entirely give

<P>it up, however; I will try what can be done--I will look

<P>it over again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your _brother_ should take the part," said Mr. Yates,

<P>in a low voice.&nbsp; "Do not you think he would?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_I_ shall not ask him," replied Tom, in a cold,

<P>determined manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards

<P>rejoined the party at the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They do not want me at all," said she, seating herself.

<P>"I only puzzle them, and oblige them to make civil speeches.

<P>Mr. Edmund Bertram, as you do not act yourself,

<P>you will be a disinterested adviser; and, therefore,

<P>I apply to _you_.&nbsp; What shall we do for an Anhalt?

<P>Is it practicable for any of the others to double it?

<P>What is your advice?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My advice," said he calmly, "is that you change the play."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_I_ should have no objection," she replied; "for though

<P>I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia

<P>if well supported, that is, if everything went well,

<P>I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as they

<P>do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_"

<P>(looking round), "it certainly will not be taken."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund said no more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would

<P>be Anhalt," observed the lady archly, after a short pause;

<P>"for he is a clergyman, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_That_ circumstance would by no means tempt me,"

<P>he replied, "for I should be sorry to make the character

<P>ridiculous by bad acting.&nbsp; It must be very difficult

<P>to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer;

<P>and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps,

<P>one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment

<P>and mortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the

<P>tea-table, and gave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was

<P>presiding there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny," cried Tom Bertram, from the other table,

<P>where the conference was eagerly carrying on, and the

<P>conversation incessant, "we want your services"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the

<P>habit of employing her in that way was not yet overcome,

<P>in spite of all that Edmund could do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat.

<P>We do not want your _present_ services.&nbsp; We shall only want

<P>you in our play.&nbsp; You must be Cottager's wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me!" cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.

<P>"Indeed you must excuse me.&nbsp; I could not act anything

<P>if you were to give me the world.&nbsp; No, indeed, I cannot act."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you.

<P>It need not frighten you:&nbsp; it is a nothing of a part,

<P>a mere nothing, not above half a dozen speeches altogether,

<P>and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say;

<P>so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have

<P>you to look at."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches," cried Mr. Rushworth,

<P>"what would you do with such a part as mine?&nbsp; I have forty-two
to

<P>learn."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,"

<P>said Fanny, shocked to find herself at that moment the

<P>only speaker in the room, and to feel that almost every

<P>eye was upon her; "but I really cannot act."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_.

<P>Learn your part, and we will teach you all the rest.

<P>You have only two scenes, and as I shall be Cottager,

<P>I'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it

<P>very well, I'll answer for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me.&nbsp; You cannot

<P>have an idea.&nbsp; It would be absolutely impossible for me.

<P>If I were to undertake it, I should only disappoint you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Phoo!&nbsp; Phoo!&nbsp; Do not be so shamefaced.&nbsp; You'll do it

<P>very well.&nbsp; Every allowance will be made for you.

<P>We do not expect perfection.&nbsp; You must get a brown gown,

<P>and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make

<P>you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at

<P>the corner of your eyes, and you will be a very proper,

<P>little old woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me," cried Fanny,

<P>growing more and more red from excessive agitation,

<P>and looking distressfully at Edmund, who was kindly

<P>observing her; but unwilling to exasperate his brother

<P>by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile.

<P>Her entreaty had no effect on Tom:&nbsp; he only said again

<P>what he had said before; and it was not merely Tom,

<P>for the requisition was now backed by Maria, and Mr. Crawford,

<P>and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed from

<P>his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious,

<P>and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny;

<P>and before she could breathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed

<P>the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry

<P>and audible--"What a piece of work here is about nothing:

<P>I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty

<P>of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind

<P>as they are to you!&nbsp; Take the part with a good grace,

<P>and let us hear no more of the matter, I entreat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not urge her, madam," said Edmund.&nbsp; "It is not fair to

<P>urge her in this manner.&nbsp; You see she does not like to act.

<P>Let her chuse for herself, as well as the rest of us.

<P>Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted.&nbsp; Do not urge

<P>her any more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not going to urge her," replied Mrs. Norris sharply;

<P>"but I shall think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl,

<P>if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her--

<P>very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and what she is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford,

<P>looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris,

<P>and then at Fanny, whose tears were beginning to shew

<P>themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, "I do

<P>not like my situation:&nbsp; this _place_ is too hot for me,"

<P>and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table,

<P>close to Fanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper,

<P>as she placed herself, "Never mind, my dear Miss Price,

<P>this is a cross evening:&nbsp; everybody is cross and teasing,

<P>but do not let us mind them"; and with pointed attention

<P>continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits,

<P>in spite of being out of spirits herself.&nbsp; By a look at

<P>her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the

<P>theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which she

<P>was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her

<P>to all the little she had lost in Edmund's favour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much

<P>obliged to her for her present kindness; and when,

<P>from taking notice of her work, and wishing _she_ could

<P>work as well, and begging for the pattern, and supposing

<P>Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of

<P>course she would come out when her cousin was married,

<P>Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately

<P>from her brother at sea, and said that she had quite

<P>a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine

<P>young man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn

<P>before he went to sea again--she could not help admitting

<P>it to be very agreeable flattery, or help listening,

<P>and answering with more animation than she had intended.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss

<P>Crawford's attention was first called from Fanny by Tom

<P>Bertram's telling her, with infinite regret, that he

<P>found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the

<P>part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler:&nbsp; he had been

<P>most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible,

<P>but it would not do; he must give it up.&nbsp; "But there will

<P>not be the smallest difficulty in filling it," he added.

<P>"We have but to speak the word; we may pick and chuse.

<P>I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within

<P>six miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company,

<P>and there are one or two that would not disgrace us:

<P>I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers

<P>or Charles Maddox.&nbsp; Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow,

<P>and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will

<P>see anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow

<P>morning and ride over to Stoke, and settle with one

<P>of them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round

<P>at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such

<P>an enlargement of the plan as this:&nbsp; so contrary to all

<P>their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.

<P>After a moment's thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied,

<P>"As far as I am concerned, I can have no objection to

<P>anything that you all think eligible.&nbsp; Have I ever seen

<P>either of the gentlemen?&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Charles Maddox dined

<P>at my sister's one day, did not he, Henry?&nbsp; A quiet-looking

<P>young man.&nbsp; I remember him.&nbsp; Let _him_ be applied to,

<P>if you please, for it will be less unpleasant to me than

<P>to have a perfect stranger."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Charles Maddox was to be the man.&nbsp; Tom repeated his resolution

<P>of going to him early on the morrow; and though Julia,

<P>who had scarcely opened her lips before, observed, in a

<P>sarcastic manner, and with a glance first at Maria and then

<P>at Edmund, that "the Mansfield theatricals would enliven

<P>the whole neighbourhood exceedingly," Edmund still held

<P>his peace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not very sanguine as to our play," said Miss Crawford,

<P>in an undervoice to Fanny, after some consideration;

<P>"and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some

<P>of _his_ speeches, and a great many of _my_ _own_,

<P>before we rehearse together.&nbsp; It will be very disagreeable,

<P>and by no means what I expected."
