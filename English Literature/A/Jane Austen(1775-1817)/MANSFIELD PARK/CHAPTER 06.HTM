<P>Mr. Bertram set off for--------, and Miss Crawford

<P>was prepared to find a great chasm in their society,

<P>and to miss him decidedly in the meetings which were now

<P>becoming almost daily between the families; and on their

<P>all dining together at the Park soon after his going,

<P>she retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table,

<P>fully expecting to feel a most melancholy difference in

<P>the change of masters.&nbsp; It would be a very flat business,

<P>she was sure.&nbsp; In comparison with his brother, Edmund would

<P>have nothing to say.&nbsp; The soup would be sent round in a

<P>most spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles

<P>or agreeable trifling, and the venison cut up without

<P>supplying one pleasant anecdote of any former haunch,

<P>or a single entertaining story, about "my friend such a one."

<P>She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the

<P>upper end of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth,

<P>who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first

<P>time since the Crawfords' arrival.&nbsp; He had been visiting

<P>a friend in the neighbouring county, and that friend

<P>having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver,

<P>Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject,

<P>and very eager to be improving his own place in the same way;

<P>and though not saying much to the purpose, could talk

<P>of nothing else.&nbsp; The subject had been already handled

<P>in the drawing-room; it was revived in the dining-parlour.

<P>Miss Bertram's attention and opinion was evidently

<P>his chief aim; and though her deportment showed rather

<P>conscious superiority than any solicitude to oblige him,

<P>the mention of Sotherton Court, and the ideas attached

<P>to it, gave her a feeling of complacency, which prevented

<P>her from being very ungracious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you could see Compton," said he; "it is the most

<P>complete thing!&nbsp; I never saw a place so altered in my life.

<P>I told Smith I did not know where I was.&nbsp; The approach _now_,

<P>is one of the finest things in the country:&nbsp; you see the

<P>house in the most surprising manner.&nbsp; I declare, when I

<P>got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison--

<P>quite a dismal old prison."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, for shame!" cried Mrs. Norris.&nbsp; "A prison indeed?

<P>Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It wants improvement, ma'am, beyond anything.&nbsp; I never

<P>saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life;

<P>and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done

<P>with it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,"

<P>said Mrs. Grant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; "but depend

<P>upon it, Sotherton will have _every_ improvement in time

<P>which his heart can desire."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must try to do something with it," said Mr. Rushworth,

<P>"but I do not know what.&nbsp; I hope I shall have some good

<P>friend to help me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your best friend upon such an occasion," said Miss

<P>Bertram calmly, "would be Mr. Repton, I imagine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is what I was thinking of.&nbsp; As he has done so

<P>well by Smith, I think I had better have him at once.

<P>His terms are five guineas a day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, and if they were _ten_," cried Mrs. Norris,

<P>"I am sure _you_ need not regard it.&nbsp; The expense need

<P>not be any impediment.&nbsp; If I were you, I should not

<P>think of the expense.&nbsp; I would have everything done

<P>in the best style, and made as nice as possible.

<P>Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that

<P>taste and money can do.&nbsp; You have space to work upon there,

<P>and grounds that will well reward you.&nbsp; For my own part,

<P>if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size

<P>of Sotherton, I should be always planting and improving,

<P>for naturally I am excessively fond of it.&nbsp; It would be

<P>too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now,

<P>with my little half acre.&nbsp; It would be quite a burlesque.

<P>But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight

<P>in improving and planting.&nbsp; We did a vast deal in that way

<P>at the Parsonage:&nbsp; we made it quite a different place

<P>from what it was when we first had it.&nbsp; You young ones

<P>do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir

<P>Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements

<P>we made:&nbsp; and a great deal more would have been done,

<P>but for poor Mr. Norris's sad state of health.&nbsp; He could

<P>hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and _that_

<P>disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas

<P>and I used to talk of.&nbsp; If it had not been for _that_,

<P>we should have carried on the garden wall, and made the

<P>plantation to shut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant

<P>has done.&nbsp; We were always doing something as it was.

<P>It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris's

<P>death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall,

<P>which is now grown such a noble tree, and getting

<P>to such perfection, sir," addressing herself then to

<P>Dr. Grant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam," replied Dr. Grant.

<P>"The soil is good; and I never pass it without regretting

<P>that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park,

<P>and it cost us--that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas,

<P>but I saw the bill--and I know it cost seven shillings,

<P>and was charged as a Moor Park."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were imposed on, ma'am," replied Dr. Grant:

<P>"these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park

<P>apricot as the fruit from that tree.&nbsp; It is an insipid

<P>fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable,

<P>which none from my garden are."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The truth is, ma'am," said Mrs. Grant, pretending to

<P>whisper across the table to Mrs. Norris, "that Dr. Grant

<P>hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is:

<P>he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it is so

<P>valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is

<P>such a remarkably large, fair sort, that what with early

<P>tarts and preserves, my cook contrives to get them all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased;

<P>and, for a little while, other subjects took place of the

<P>improvements of Sotherton.&nbsp; Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris

<P>were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had begun

<P>in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again.

<P>"Smith's place is the admiration of all the country;

<P>and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand.

<P>I think I shall have Repton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Rushworth," said Lady Bertram, "if I were you,

<P>I would have a very pretty shrubbery.&nbsp; One likes to get

<P>out into a shrubbery in fine weather."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his

<P>acquiescence, and tried to make out something complimentary;

<P>but, between his submission to _her_ taste, and his having

<P>always intended the same himself, with the superadded

<P>objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies

<P>in general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom

<P>he was anxious to please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was

<P>glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine.

<P>Mr. Rushworth, however, though not usually a great talker,

<P>had still more to say on the subject next his heart.

<P>"Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether

<P>in his grounds, which is little enough, and makes it more

<P>surprising that the place can have been so improved.

<P>Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred,

<P>without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think,

<P>if so much could be done at Compton, we need not despair.

<P>There have been two or three fine old trees cut down, that grew

<P>too near the house, and it opens the prospect amazingly,

<P>which makes me think that Repton, or anybody of that sort,

<P>would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down:&nbsp; the avenue

<P>that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,

<P>you know," turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke.

<P>But Miss Bertram thought it most becoming to reply--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The avenue!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I do not recollect it.&nbsp; I really know

<P>very little of Sotherton."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund,

<P>exactly opposite Miss Crawford, and who had been attentively

<P>listening, now looked at him, and said in a low voice--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cut down an avenue!&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp; Does it not make you

<P>think of Cowper?&nbsp; 'Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn

<P>your fate unmerited.'&nbsp; "
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He smiled as he answered, "I am afraid the avenue stands

<P>a bad chance, Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down,

<P>to see the place as it is now, in its old state; but I do

<P>not suppose I shall."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you never been there?&nbsp; No, you never can;

<P>and, unluckily, it is out of distance for a ride.

<P>I wish we could contrive it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! it does not signify.&nbsp; Whenever I do see it,

<P>you will tell me how it has been altered."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I collect," said Miss Crawford, "that Sotherton

<P>is an old place, and a place of some grandeur.

<P>In any particular style of building?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The house was built in Elizabeth's time, and is a large,

<P>regular, brick building; heavy, but respectable looking,

<P>and has many good rooms.&nbsp; It is ill placed.&nbsp; It stands

<P>in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that respect,

<P>unfavourable for improvement.&nbsp; But the woods are fine,

<P>and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made

<P>a good deal of.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth is quite right, I think,

<P>in meaning to give it a modern dress, and I have no doubt

<P>that it will be all done extremely well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself,

<P>"He is a well-bred man; he makes the best of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth," he continued;

<P>"but, had I a place to new fashion, I should not put

<P>myself into the hands of an improver.&nbsp; I would rather

<P>have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own choice,

<P>and acquired progressively.&nbsp; I would rather abide by my own

<P>blunders than by his."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_You_ would know what you were about, of course;

<P>but that would not suit _me_.&nbsp; I have no eye or

<P>ingenuity for such matters, but as they are before me;

<P>and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be

<P>most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it,

<P>and give me as much beauty as he could for my money;

<P>and I should never look at it till it was complete."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress

<P>of it all," said Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ay, you have been brought up to it.&nbsp; It was no part of

<P>my education; and the only dose I ever had, being administered

<P>by not the first favourite in the world, has made me consider

<P>improvements _in_ _hand_ as the greatest of nuisances.

<P>Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle, bought a

<P>cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in;

<P>and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures;

<P>but it being excessively pretty, it was soon found

<P>necessary to be improved, and for three months we were

<P>all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to step on,

<P>or a bench fit for use.&nbsp; I would have everything as complete

<P>as possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens,

<P>and rustic seats innumerable:&nbsp; but it must all be done

<P>without my care.&nbsp; Henry is different; he loves to be doing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much

<P>disposed to admire, speak so freely of her uncle.

<P>It did not suit his sense of propriety, and he was silenced,

<P>till induced by further smiles and liveliness to put

<P>the matter by for the present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Bertram," said she, "I have tidings of my harp at last.

<P>I am assured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it

<P>has probably been these ten days, in spite of the solemn

<P>assurances we have so often received to the contrary."

<P>Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.&nbsp; "The truth is,

<P>that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,

<P>we went ourselves:&nbsp; this will not do seventy miles from London;

<P>but this morning we heard of it in the right way.

<P>It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller,

<P>and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's

<P>son-in-law left word at the shop."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means,

<P>and hope there will be no further delay."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it

<P>is to be conveyed?&nbsp; Not by a wagon or cart:&nbsp; oh no!

<P>nothing of that kind could be hired in the village.

<P>I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now,

<P>in the middle of a very late hay harvest, to hire a horse

<P>and cart?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it!

<P>To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible,

<P>so I told my maid to speak for one directly; and as I cannot

<P>look out of my dressing-closet without seeing one farmyard,

<P>nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another,

<P>I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather

<P>grieved that I could not give the advantage to all.

<P>Guess my surprise, when I found that I had been asking

<P>the most unreasonable, most impossible thing in the world;

<P>had offended all the farmers, all the labourers,

<P>all the hay in the parish!&nbsp; As for Dr. Grant's bailiff,

<P>I believe I had better keep out of _his_ way; and my

<P>brother-in-law himself, who is all kindness in general,

<P>looked rather black upon me when he found what I had

<P>been at."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before;

<P>but when you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance

<P>of getting in the grass.&nbsp; The hire of a cart at any time

<P>might not be so easy as you suppose:&nbsp; our farmers are

<P>not in the habit of letting them out; but, in harvest,

<P>it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down

<P>with the true London maxim, that everything is to be

<P>got with money, I was a little embarrassed at first

<P>by the sturdy independence of your country customs.

<P>However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry,

<P>who is good-nature itself, has offered to fetch

<P>it in his barouche.&nbsp; Will it not be honourably conveyed?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument,

<P>and hoped to be soon allowed to hear her.&nbsp; Fanny had never

<P>heard the harp at all, and wished for it very much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall be most happy to play to you both," said Miss

<P>Crawford; "at least as long as you can like to listen:

<P>probably much longer, for I dearly love music myself,

<P>and where the natural taste is equal the player must

<P>always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways

<P>than one.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother,

<P>I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come:

<P>he heard so much of my misery about it.&nbsp; And you may say,

<P>if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive

<P>airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings,

<P>as I know his horse will lose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not,

<P>at present, foresee any occasion for writing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth,

<P>would you ever write to him, nor he to you, if it could

<P>be helped.&nbsp; The occasion would never be foreseen.

<P>What strange creatures brothers are!&nbsp; You would not write

<P>to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world;

<P>and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse

<P>is ill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the fewest

<P>possible words.&nbsp; You have but one style among you.

<P>I know it perfectly.&nbsp; Henry, who is in every other respect

<P>exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me,

<P>confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together,

<P>has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often

<P>it is nothing more than--'Dear Mary, I am just arrived.

<P>Bath seems full, and everything as usual.&nbsp; Yours sincerely.'

<P>That is the true manly style; that is a complete

<P>brother's letter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When they are at a distance from all their family,"

<P>said Fanny, colouring for William's sake, "they can write

<P>long letters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Price has a brother at sea," said Edmund,

<P>"whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think

<P>you too severe upon us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At sea, has she?&nbsp; In the king's service, of course?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story,

<P>but his determined silence obliged her to relate her

<P>brother's situation:&nbsp; her voice was animated in speaking

<P>of his profession, and the foreign stations he had been on;

<P>but she could not mention the number of years that he

<P>had been absent without tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Miss Crawford

<P>civilly wished him an early promotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you know anything of my cousin's captain?" said Edmund;

<P>"Captain Marshall?&nbsp; You have a large acquaintance in the navy,

<P>I conclude?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Among admirals, large enough; but," with an air of grandeur,

<P>"we know very little of the inferior ranks.&nbsp; Post-captains may

<P>be very good sort of men, but they do not belong to _us_.

<P>Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal:

<P>of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay,

<P>and their bickerings and jealousies.&nbsp; But, in general,

<P>I can assure you that they are all passed over, and all

<P>very ill used.&nbsp; Certainly, my home at my uncle's brought

<P>me acquainted with a circle of admirals.&nbsp; Of _Rears_ and

<P>_Vices_ I saw enough.&nbsp; Now do not be suspecting me of a pun,

<P>I entreat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund again felt grave, and only replied, "It is

<P>a noble profession."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances:

<P>if it make the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it;

<P>but, in short, it is not a favourite profession of mine.

<P>It has never worn an amiable form to _me_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy

<P>in the prospect of hearing her play.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still

<P>under consideration among the others; and Mrs. Grant could

<P>not help addressing her brother, though it was calling

<P>his attention from Miss Julia Bertram.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say?&nbsp; You have been

<P>an improver yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham,

<P>it may vie with any place in England.&nbsp; Its natural beauties,

<P>I am sure, are great.&nbsp; Everingham, as it _used_ to be,

<P>was perfect in my estimation:&nbsp; such a happy fall of ground,

<P>and such timber!&nbsp; What would I not give to see it again?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your

<P>opinion of it," was his answer; "but I fear there would

<P>be some disappointment:&nbsp; you would not find it equal

<P>to your present ideas.&nbsp; In extent, it is a mere nothing;

<P>you would be surprised at its insignificance; and,

<P>as for improvement, there was very little for me to do--

<P>too little:&nbsp; I should like to have been busy much longer."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are fond of the sort of thing?" said Julia.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of

<P>the ground, which pointed out, even to a very young eye,

<P>what little remained to be done, and my own consequent

<P>resolutions, I had not been of age three months before

<P>Everingham was all that it is now.&nbsp; My plan was laid

<P>at Westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge,

<P>and at one-and-twenty executed.&nbsp; I am inclined to envy

<P>Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him.

<P>I have been a devourer of my own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,"

<P>said Julia.&nbsp; "_You_ can never want employment.

<P>Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth, you should assist

<P>him with your opinion."

<P>Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech,

<P>enforced it warmly, persuaded that no judgment could

<P>be equal to her brother's; and as Miss Bertram caught

<P>at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,

<P>declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better

<P>to consult with friends and disinterested advisers,

<P>than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a

<P>professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very ready to request

<P>the favour of Mr. Crawford's assistance; and Mr. Crawford,

<P>after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at

<P>his service in any way that could be useful.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth

<P>then began to propose Mr. Crawford's doing him the honour

<P>of coming over to Sotherton, and taking a bed there;

<P>when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her two nieces'

<P>minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take

<P>Mr. Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford's willingness;

<P>but why should not more of us go?&nbsp; Why should not we

<P>make a little party?&nbsp; Here are many that would be

<P>interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth,

<P>and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford's opinion on

<P>the spot, and that might be of some small use to you with

<P>_their_ opinions; and, for my own part, I have been long

<P>wishing to wait upon your good mother again; nothing but

<P>having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss;

<P>but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>while the rest of you walked about and settled things,

<P>and then we could all return to a late dinner here,

<P>or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most agreeable to

<P>your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.

<P>I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me

<P>in his barouche, and Edmund can go on horseback, you know,

<P>sister, and Fanny will stay at home with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in

<P>the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence,

<P>excepting Edmund, who heard it all and said nothing.
