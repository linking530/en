<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being

<P>with William, soon produced their natural effect on

<P>Fanny's spirits, when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind;

<P>and by the time their first stage was ended, and they

<P>were to quit Sir Thomas's carriage, she was able to take

<P>leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages,

<P>with cheerful looks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there

<P>was no end.&nbsp; Everything supplied an amusement to the high

<P>glee of William's mind, and he was full of frolic and

<P>joke in the intervals of their higher-toned subjects,

<P>all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise

<P>of the Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed,

<P>schemes for an action with some superior force,

<P>which (supposing the first lieutenant out of the way,

<P>and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant)

<P>was to give himself the next step as soon as possible,

<P>or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously

<P>distributed at home, with only the reservation of enough

<P>to make the little cottage comfortable, in which he and Fanny

<P>were to pass all their middle and later life together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's immediate concerns, as far as they involved

<P>Mr. Crawford, made no part of their conversation.

<P>William knew what had passed, and from his heart lamented

<P>that his sister's feelings should be so cold towards a man

<P>whom he must consider as the first of human characters;

<P>but he was of an age to be all for love, and therefore

<P>unable to blame; and knowing her wish on the subject,

<P>he would not distress her by the slightest allusion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by

<P>Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; She had heard repeatedly from his sister within

<P>the three weeks which had passed since their leaving Mansfield,

<P>and in each letter there had been a few lines from himself,

<P>warm and determined like his speeches.&nbsp; It was a correspondence

<P>which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had feared.

<P>Miss Crawford's style of writing, lively and affectionate,

<P>was itself an evil, independent of what she was thus

<P>forced into reading from the brother's pen, for Edmund

<P>would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter

<P>to him; and then she had to listen to his admiration

<P>of her language, and the warmth of her attachments.

<P>There had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion,

<P>of recollection, so much of Mansfield in every letter,

<P>that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear;

<P>and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind,

<P>compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her

<P>the addresses of the man she did not love, and obliging

<P>her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did,

<P>was cruelly mortifying.&nbsp; Here, too, her present removal

<P>promised advantage.&nbsp; When no longer under the same roof

<P>with Edmund, she trusted that Miss Crawford would have no

<P>motive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble,

<P>and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle

<P>into nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others,

<P>Fanny proceeded in her journey safely and cheerfully,

<P>and as expeditiously as could rationally be hoped

<P>in the dirty month of February.&nbsp; They entered Oxford,

<P>but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund's

<P>college as they passed along, and made no stop anywhere

<P>till they reached Newbury, where a comfortable meal,

<P>uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoyments and

<P>fatigues of the day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next morning saw them off again at an early hour;

<P>and with no events, and no delays, they regularly advanced,

<P>and were in the environs of Portsmouth while there was yet

<P>daylight for Fanny to look around her, and wonder at the

<P>new buildings.&nbsp; They passed the drawbridge, and entered

<P>the town; and the light was only beginning to fail as,

<P>guided by William's powerful voice, they were rattled

<P>into a narrow street, leading from the High Street,

<P>and drawn up before the door of a small house now inhabited

<P>by Mr. Price.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension.

<P>The moment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant,

<P>seemingly in waiting for them at the door, stepped forward,

<P>and more intent on telling the news than giving them any help,

<P>immediately began with, "The Thrush is gone out of harbour,

<P>please sir, and one of the officers has been here to--

<P>" She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old,

<P>who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside,

<P>and while William was opening the chaise-door himself,

<P>called out, "You are just in time.&nbsp; We have been looking

<P>for you this half-hour. The Thrush went out of harbour

<P>this morning.&nbsp; I saw her.&nbsp; It was a beautiful sight.

<P>And they think she will have her orders in a day or two.

<P>And Mr. Campbell was here at four o'clock to ask for you:

<P>he has got one of the Thrush's boats, and is going off

<P>to her at six, and hoped you would be here in time to go

<P>with him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of

<P>the carriage, was all the voluntary notice which this

<P>brother bestowed; but he made no objection to her

<P>kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailing

<P>farther particulars of the Thrush's going out of harbour,

<P>in which he had a strong right of interest, being to

<P>commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage

<P>of the house, and in her mother's arms, who met her

<P>there with looks of true kindness, and with features

<P>which Fanny loved the more, because they brought her aunt

<P>Bertram's before her, and there were her two sisters:

<P>Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey,

<P>the youngest of the family, about five--both glad to see

<P>her in their way, though with no advantage of manner

<P>in receiving her.&nbsp; But manner Fanny did not want.

<P>Would they but love her, she should be satisfied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was then taken into a parlour, so small that her

<P>first conviction was of its being only a passage-room

<P>to something better, and she stood for a moment expecting

<P>to be invited on; but when she saw there was no other door,

<P>and that there were signs of habitation before her,

<P>she called back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved

<P>lest they should have been suspected.&nbsp; Her mother,

<P>however, could not stay long enough to suspect anything.

<P>She was gone again to the street-door, to welcome William.

<P>"Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you.

<P>But have you heard about the Thrush?&nbsp; She is gone out of

<P>harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it;

<P>and I do not know what I am to do about Sam's things,

<P>they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders

<P>to-morrow, perhaps.&nbsp; It takes me quite unawares.&nbsp; And now

<P>you must be off for Spithead too.&nbsp; Campbell has been here,

<P>quite in a worry about you; and now what shall we do?

<P>I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you,

<P>and here everything comes upon me at once."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her son answered cheerfully, telling her that everything

<P>was always for the best; and making light of his own

<P>inconvenience in being obliged to hurry away so soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour,

<P>that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort;

<P>but as there is a boat ashore, I had better go off at once,

<P>and there is no help for it.&nbsp; Whereabouts does the Thrush

<P>lay at Spithead?&nbsp; Near the Canopus?&nbsp; But no matter;

<P>here's Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in

<P>the passage?&nbsp; Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your

<P>own dear Fanny yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed

<P>her daughter again, and commented a little on her growth,

<P>began with very natural solicitude to feel for their

<P>fatigues and wants as travellers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now,

<P>what will you have?&nbsp; I began to think you would never come.

<P>Betsey and I have been watching for you this half-hour.

<P>And when did you get anything to eat?&nbsp; And what would you

<P>like to have now?&nbsp; I could not tell whether you would be

<P>for some meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey,

<P>or else I would have got something ready.&nbsp; And now I

<P>am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time

<P>to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand.

<P>It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street.

<P>We were better off in our last house.&nbsp; Perhaps you would

<P>like some tea as soon as it can be got."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They both declared they should prefer it to anything.

<P>"Then, Betsey, my dear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca

<P>has put the water on; and tell her to bring in the tea-things

<P>as soon as she can.&nbsp; I wish we could get the bell mended;

<P>but Betsey is a very handy little messenger."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities

<P>before her fine new sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear me!" continued the anxious mother, "what a sad

<P>fire we have got, and I dare say you are both starved

<P>with cold.&nbsp; Draw your chair nearer, my dear.&nbsp; I cannot

<P>think what Rebecca has been about.&nbsp; I am sure I told her

<P>to bring some coals half an hour ago.&nbsp; Susan, you should

<P>have taken care of the fire."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was upstairs, mama, moving my things," said Susan,

<P>in a fearless, self-defending tone, which startled Fanny.

<P>"You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny

<P>and I should have the other room; and I could not get

<P>Rebecca to give me any help."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles:

<P>first, the driver came to be paid; then there was a squabble

<P>between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up

<P>his sister's trunk, which he would manage all his own way;

<P>and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his own loud

<P>voice preceding him, as with something of the oath kind

<P>he kicked away his son's port-manteau and his daughter's

<P>bandbox in the passage, and called out for a candle;

<P>no candle was brought, however, and he walked into the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him,

<P>but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished

<P>in the dusk, and unthought of.&nbsp; With a friendly shake

<P>of his son's hand, and an eager voice, he instantly began--

<P>"Ha! welcome back, my boy.&nbsp; Glad to see you.&nbsp; Have you heard

<P>the news?&nbsp; The Thrush went out of harbour this morning.

<P>Sharp is the word, you see!&nbsp; By G--, you are just in time!

<P>The doctor has been here inquiring for you:&nbsp; he has got

<P>one of the boats, and is to be off for Spithead by six,

<P>so you had better go with him.&nbsp; I have been to Turner's

<P>about your mess; it is all in a way to be done.

<P>I should not wonder if you had your orders to-morrow:

<P>but you cannot sail with this wind, if you are to cruise

<P>to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly

<P>have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant.

<P>By G--, I wish you may!&nbsp; But old Scholey was saying,

<P>just now, that he thought you would be sent first to

<P>the Texel.&nbsp; Well, well, we are ready, whatever happens.

<P>But by G--, you lost a fine sight by not being here

<P>in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour!

<P>I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds.

<P>Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time, to say she had

<P>slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up,

<P>and made but two steps to the platform.&nbsp; If ever there

<P>was a perfect beauty afloat, she is one; and there she lays

<P>at Spithead, and anybody in England would take her for an

<P>eight-and-twenty. I was upon the platform two hours this

<P>afternoon looking at her.&nbsp; She lays close to the Endymion,

<P>between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the

<P>sheer hulk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ha!" cried William, "_that's_ just where I should have

<P>put her myself.&nbsp; It's the best berth at Spithead.

<P>But here is my sister, sir; here is Fanny," turning and

<P>leading her forward; "it is so dark you do not see her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her,

<P>Mr. Price now received his daughter; and having given

<P>her a cordial hug, and observed that she was grown into

<P>a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon,

<P>seemed very much inclined to forget her again.

<P>Fanny shrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly

<P>pained by his language and his smell of spirits;

<P>and he talked on only to his son, and only of the Thrush,

<P>though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,

<P>more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny,

<P>and her long absence and long journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained;

<P>but as there was still no appearance of tea, nor, from

<P>Betsey's reports from the kitchen, much hope of any under

<P>a considerable period, William determined to go and change

<P>his dress, and make the necessary preparations for his removal

<P>on board directly, that he might have his tea in comfort

<P>afterwards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty,

<P>about eight and nine years old, rushed into it just released

<P>from school, and coming eagerly to see their sister,

<P>and tell that the Thrush was gone out of harbour;

<P>Tom and Charles.&nbsp; Charles had been born since Fanny's

<P>going away, but Tom she had often helped to nurse,

<P>and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again.

<P>Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she wanted

<P>to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby

<P>she had loved, and talked to, of his infant preference

<P>of herself.&nbsp; Tom, however, had no mind for such treatment:

<P>he came home not to stand and be talked to, but to run about

<P>and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst from her,

<P>and slammed the parlour-door till her temples ached.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had now seen all that were at home; there remained

<P>only two brothers between herself and Susan,

<P>one of whom was a clerk in a public office in London,

<P>and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman.

<P>But though she had _seen_ all the members of the family,

<P>she had not yet _heard_ all the noise they could make.

<P>Another quarter of an hour brought her a great deal more.

<P>William was soon calling out from the landing-place

<P>of the second story for his mother and for Rebecca.

<P>He was in distress for something that he had left there,

<P>and did not find again.&nbsp; A key was mislaid, Betsey accused

<P>of having got at his new hat, and some slight, but essential

<P>alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had been

<P>promised to have done for him, entirely neglected.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves,

<P>all talking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job

<P>was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry;

<P>William trying in vain to send Betsey down again, or keep

<P>her from being troublesome where she was; the whole of which,

<P>as almost every door in the house was open, could be plainly

<P>distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at intervals

<P>by the superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing

<P>each other up and down stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was almost stunned.&nbsp; The smallness of the house

<P>and thinness of the walls brought everything so close

<P>to her, that, added to the fatigue of her journey, and all

<P>her recent agitation, she hardly knew how to bear it.

<P>_Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan having

<P>disappeared with the others, there were soon only her father

<P>and herself remaining; and he, taking out a newspaper,

<P>the accustomary loan of a neighbour, applied himself to

<P>studying it, without seeming to recollect her existence.

<P>The solitary candle was held between himself and the paper,

<P>without any reference to her possible convenience;

<P>but she had nothing to do, and was glad to have the light

<P>screened from her aching head, as she sat in bewildered,

<P>broken, sorrowful contemplation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was at home.&nbsp; But, alas! it was not such a home,

<P>she had not such a welcome, as--she checked herself;

<P>she was unreasonable.&nbsp; What right had she to be of importance

<P>to her family?&nbsp; She could have none, so long lost sight of!

<P>William's concerns must be dearest, they always had been,

<P>and he had every right.&nbsp; Yet to have so little said

<P>or asked about herself, to have scarcely an inquiry made

<P>after Mansfield!&nbsp; It did pain her to have Mansfield forgotten;

<P>the friends who had done so much--the dear, dear friends!

<P>But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest.

<P>Perhaps it must be so.&nbsp; The destination of the Thrush

<P>must be now preeminently interesting.&nbsp; A day or two

<P>might shew the difference.&nbsp; _She_ only was to blame.

<P>Yet she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield.

<P>No, in her uncle's house there would have been a

<P>consideration of times and seasons, a regulation of subject,

<P>a propriety, an attention towards everybody which there

<P>was not here.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The only interruption which thoughts like these received

<P>for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her

<P>father's, not at all calculated to compose them.&nbsp; At a more

<P>than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in the passage,

<P>he exclaimed, "Devil take those young dogs!&nbsp; How they are

<P>singing out!&nbsp; Ay, Sam's voice louder than all the rest!

<P>That boy is fit for a boatswain.&nbsp; Holla, you there!

<P>Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or I shall be after you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This threat was so palpably disregarded, that though

<P>within five minutes afterwards the three boys all burst

<P>into the room together and sat down, Fanny could not

<P>consider it as a proof of anything more than their being

<P>for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces

<P>and panting breaths seemed to prove, especially as they

<P>were still kicking each other's shins, and hallooing

<P>out at sudden starts immediately under their father's eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next opening of the door brought something more welcome:

<P>it was for the tea-things, which she had begun almost

<P>to despair of seeing that evening.&nbsp; Susan and an

<P>attendant girl, whose inferior appearance informed Fanny,

<P>to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the

<P>upper servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal;

<P>Susan looking, as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced

<P>at her sister, as if divided between the agreeable triumph

<P>of shewing her activity and usefulness, and the dread

<P>of being thought to demean herself by such an office.

<P>"She had been into the kitchen," she said, "to hurry Sally

<P>and help make the toast, and spread the bread and butter,

<P>or she did not know when they should have got tea,

<P>and she was sure her sister must want something after

<P>her journey."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was very thankful.&nbsp; She could not but own that she

<P>should be very glad of a little tea, and Susan immediately

<P>set about making it, as if pleased to have the employment

<P>all to herself; and with only a little unnecessary bustle,

<P>and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her brothers

<P>in better order than she could, acquitted herself very well.

<P>Fanny's spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head

<P>and heart were soon the better for such well-timed kindness.

<P>Susan had an open, sensible countenance; she was like William,

<P>and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition

<P>and goodwill towards herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this more placid state of things William reentered,

<P>followed not far behind by his mother and Betsey.

<P>He, complete in his lieutenant's uniform, looking and

<P>moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful for it,

<P>and with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directly

<P>to Fanny, who, rising from her seat, looked at him for a

<P>moment in speechless admiration, and then threw her arms

<P>round his neck to sob out her various emotions of pain and

<P>pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Anxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself;

<P>and wiping away her tears, was able to notice and admire

<P>all the striking parts of his dress; listening with reviving

<P>spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part

<P>of every day before they sailed, and even of getting

<P>her to Spithead to see the sloop.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon

<P>of the Thrush, a very well-behaved young man, who came

<P>to call for his friend, and for whom there was with some

<P>contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty washing of

<P>the young tea-maker's, a cup and saucer; and after another

<P>quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen,

<P>noise rising upon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and

<P>boys at last all in motion together, the moment came

<P>for setting off; everything was ready, William took leave,

<P>and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spite

<P>of their mother's entreaty, determined to see their brother

<P>and Mr. Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked

<P>off at the same time to carry back his neighbour's newspaper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for;

<P>and accordingly, when Rebecca had been prevailed on

<P>to carry away the tea-things, and Mrs. Price had walked

<P>about the room some time looking for a shirt-sleeve, which

<P>Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen,

<P>the small party of females were pretty well composed,

<P>and the mother having lamented again over the impossibility

<P>of getting Sam ready in time, was at leisure to think

<P>of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few inquiries began:&nbsp; but one of the earliest--"How did

<P>sister Bertram manage about her servants?&nbsp; "Was she

<P>as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants?"--

<P>soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire, and fixed it

<P>on her own domestic grievances, and the shocking character

<P>of all the Portsmouth servants, of whom she believed her

<P>own two were the very worst, engrossed her completely.

<P>The Bertrams were all forgotten in detailing the faults

<P>of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much to depose,

<P>and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem

<P>so thoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny

<P>could not help modestly presuming that her mother meant

<P>to part with her when her year was up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Her year!" cried Mrs. Price; "I am sure I hope I

<P>shall be rid of her before she has staid a year,

<P>for that will not be up till November.&nbsp; Servants are come

<P>to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is quite

<P>a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year.

<P>I have no hope of ever being settled; and if I was to

<P>part with Rebecca, I should only get something worse.

<P>And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress

<P>to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough,

<P>for there is always a girl under her, and I often do half

<P>the work myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there

<P>might not be a remedy found for some of these evils.

<P>As she now sat looking at Betsey, she could not but think

<P>particularly of another sister, a very pretty little girl,

<P>whom she had left there not much younger when she went

<P>into Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards.

<P>There had been something remarkably amiable about her.

<P>Fanny in those early days had preferred her to Susan;

<P>and when the news of her death had at last reached Mansfield,

<P>had for a short time been quite afflicted.&nbsp; The sight

<P>of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again,

<P>but she would not have pained her mother by alluding to her

<P>for the world.&nbsp; While considering her with these ideas,

<P>Betsey, at a small distance, was holding out something to

<P>catch her eyes, meaning to screen it at the same time from

<P>Susan's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What have you got there, my love?" said Fanny;

<P>"come and shew it to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a silver knife.&nbsp; Up jumped Susan, claiming it

<P>as her own, and trying to get it away; but the child ran

<P>to her mother's protection, and Susan could only reproach,

<P>which she did very warmly, and evidently hoping to

<P>interest Fanny on her side.&nbsp; "It was very hard that she

<P>was not to have her _own_ knife; it was her own knife;

<P>little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed,

<P>and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago.

<P>But mama kept it from her, and was always letting Betsey

<P>get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey

<P>would spoil it, and get it for her own, though mama

<P>had _promised_ her that Betsey should not have it in her

<P>own hands."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was quite shocked.&nbsp; Every feeling of duty,

<P>honour, and tenderness was wounded by her sister's

<P>speech and her mother's reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Susan," cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice,

<P>"now, how can you be so cross?&nbsp; You are always quarrelling

<P>about that knife.&nbsp; I wish you would not be so quarrelsome.

<P>Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to you!&nbsp; But you

<P>should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you

<P>to the drawer.&nbsp; You know I told you not to touch it,

<P>because Susan is so cross about it.&nbsp; I must hide it

<P>another time, Betsey.&nbsp; Poor Mary little thought it would

<P>be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep,

<P>only two hours before she died.&nbsp; Poor little soul! she could

<P>but just speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, "Let sister

<P>Susan have my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried."

<P>Poor little dear! she was so fond of it, Fanny, that she

<P>would have it lay by her in bed, all through her illness.

<P>It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs. Admiral

<P>Maxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death.

<P>Poor little sweet creature!&nbsp; Well, she was taken away

<P>from evil to come.&nbsp; My own Betsey" (fondling her),

<P>"_you_ have not the luck of such a good godmother.

<P>Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little

<P>people as you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris,

<P>but a message to say she hoped that her god-daughter

<P>was a good girl, and learnt her book.&nbsp; There had been

<P>at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room

<P>at Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer-book;

<P>but no second sound had been heard of such a purpose.

<P>Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home and taken down two

<P>old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but,

<P>upon examination, the ardour of generosity went off.

<P>One was found to have too small a print for a child's eyes,

<P>and the other to be too cumbersome for her to carry about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept

<P>the first invitation of going to bed; and before Betsey

<P>had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one

<P>hour extraordinary in honour of sister, she was off,

<P>leaving all below in confusion and noise again; the boys

<P>begging for toasted cheese, her father calling out for his

<P>rum and water, and Rebecca never where she ought to be.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined

<P>and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share

<P>with Susan.&nbsp; The smallness of the rooms above and below,

<P>indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and staircase,

<P>struck her beyond her imagination.&nbsp; She soon learned to think

<P>with respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park,

<P>in&nbsp; that&nbsp; house reckoned too small for anybody's comfort.
