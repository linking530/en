<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections,

<P>afforded the Miss Bertrams much more agreeable feelings

<P>than were derived from the letters from Antigua,

<P>which soon afterwards reached Mansfield.&nbsp; It was much

<P>pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father;

<P>and to think of their father in England again within

<P>a certain period, which these letters obliged them to do,

<P>was a most unwelcome exercise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>November was the black month fixed for his return.

<P>Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience

<P>and anxiety could authorise.&nbsp; His business was so nearly

<P>concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his

<P>passage in the September packet, and he consequently

<P>looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved

<P>family again early in November.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the

<P>father brought a husband, and the return of the friend most

<P>solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover,

<P>on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend.

<P>It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to

<P>throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared

<P>away she should see something else.&nbsp; It would hardly

<P>be _early_ in November, there were generally delays,

<P>a bad passage or _something_; that favouring _something_

<P>which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look,

<P>or their understandings while they reason, feels the

<P>comfort of.&nbsp; It would probably be the middle of November

<P>at least; the middle of November was three months off.

<P>Three months comprised thirteen weeks.&nbsp; Much might happen

<P>in thirteen weeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion

<P>of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return,

<P>and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the

<P>interest it excited in the breast of another young lady.

<P>Miss Crawford, on walking up with her brother to spend

<P>the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news;

<P>and though seeming to have no concern in the affair

<P>beyond politeness, and to have vented all her feelings

<P>in a quiet congratulation, heard it with an attention

<P>not so easily satisfied.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris gave the particulars

<P>of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,

<P>as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with

<P>Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene,

<P>while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth, and Henry Crawford

<P>were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, she suddenly

<P>revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying,

<P>"How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!&nbsp; He is thinking of November."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing

<P>to say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your father's return will be a very interesting event."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence

<P>not only long, but including so many dangers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events:

<P>your sister's marriage, and your taking orders."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be affronted," said she, laughing, "but it does

<P>put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who,

<P>after performing great exploits in a foreign land,

<P>offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no sacrifice in the case," replied Edmund,

<P>with a serious smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again;

<P>"it is entirely her own doing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes I know it is.&nbsp; I was merely joking.&nbsp; She has

<P>done no more than what every young woman would do;

<P>and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy.

<P>My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary

<P>as Maria's marrying."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's

<P>convenience should accord so well.&nbsp; There is a very good

<P>living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which you suppose has biassed me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But _that_ I am sure it has not," cried Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than

<P>I would affirm myself.&nbsp; On the contrary, the knowing

<P>that there was such a provision for me probably did

<P>bias me.&nbsp; Nor can I think it wrong that it should.

<P>There was no natural disinclination to be overcome,

<P>and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman

<P>for knowing that he will have a competence early in life.

<P>I was in safe hands.&nbsp; I hope I should not have been

<P>influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father

<P>was too conscientious to have allowed it.&nbsp; I have no doubt

<P>that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is the same sort of thing," said Fanny, after a

<P>short pause, "as for the son of an admiral to go into

<P>the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army,

<P>and nobody sees anything wrong in that.&nbsp; Nobody wonders

<P>that they should prefer the line where their friends can

<P>serve them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest

<P>in it than they appear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good.&nbsp; The profession,

<P>either navy or army, is its own justification.&nbsp; It has

<P>everything in its favour:&nbsp; heroism, danger, bustle, fashion.

<P>Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society.

<P>Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty

<P>of preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?"

<P>said Edmund.&nbsp; "To be justified in your eyes, he must

<P>do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What! take orders without a living!&nbsp; No; that is

<P>madness indeed; absolute madness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man

<P>is neither to take orders with a living nor without?

<P>No; for you certainly would not know what to say.

<P>But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from

<P>your own argument.&nbsp; As he cannot be influenced by those

<P>feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward

<P>to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession,

<P>as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him,

<P>he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting

<P>sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income

<P>ready made, to the trouble of working for one; and has

<P>the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his

<P>days but eat, drink, and grow fat.&nbsp; It is indolence,

<P>Mr. Bertram, indeed.&nbsp; Indolence and love of ease; a want

<P>of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company,

<P>or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable,

<P>which make men clergymen.&nbsp; A clergyman has nothing

<P>to do but be slovenly and selfish--read the newspaper,

<P>watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife.&nbsp; His curate

<P>does all the work, and the business of his own life is

<P>to dine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they

<P>are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming

<P>it their general character.&nbsp; I suspect that in this

<P>comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure, you are

<P>not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons,

<P>whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing.

<P>It is impossible that your own observation can have given

<P>you much knowledge of the clergy.&nbsp; You can have been

<P>personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you

<P>condemn so conclusively.&nbsp; You are speaking what you have

<P>been told at your uncle's table."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I speak what appears to me the general opinion;

<P>and where an opinion is general, it is usually correct.

<P>Though _I_ have not seen much of the domestic lives

<P>of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency

<P>of information."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination,

<P>are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency

<P>of information, or (smiling) of something else.

<P>Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps knew little

<P>of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad,

<P>they were always wishing away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor William!&nbsp; He has met with great kindness from

<P>the chaplain of the Antwerp," was a tender apostrophe

<P>of Fanny's, very much to the purpose of her own feelings

<P>if not of the conversation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from

<P>my uncle," said Miss Crawford, "that I can hardly suppose--

<P>and since you push me so hard, I must observe, that I am

<P>not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are,

<P>being at this present time the guest of my own brother,

<P>Dr. Grant.&nbsp; And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging

<P>to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say,

<P>a good scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons,

<P>and is very respectable, _I_ see him to be an indolent,

<P>selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have his palate consulted

<P>in everything; who will not stir a finger for the convenience

<P>of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder,

<P>is out of humour with his excellent wife.&nbsp; To own the truth,

<P>Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening

<P>by a disappointment about a green goose, which he could

<P>not get the better of.&nbsp; My poor sister was forced to stay

<P>and bear it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word.

<P>It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty

<P>habit of self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering

<P>from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings

<P>as yours.&nbsp; Fanny, it goes against us.&nbsp; We cannot attempt

<P>to defend Dr. Grant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," replied Fanny, "but we need not give up his profession

<P>for all that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant

<P>had chosen, he would have taken a--not a good temper into it;

<P>and as he must, either in the navy or army, have had a

<P>great many more people under his command than he has now,

<P>I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a

<P>sailor or soldier than as a clergyman.&nbsp; Besides, I cannot

<P>but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise

<P>in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of

<P>becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession,

<P>where he would have had less time and obligation--

<P>where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself,

<P>the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledge which it

<P>is impossible he should escape as he is now.&nbsp; A man--

<P>a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit

<P>of teaching others their duty every week, cannot go

<P>to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very good

<P>sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being

<P>the better for it himself.&nbsp; It must make him think;

<P>and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain

<P>himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish

<P>you a better fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man

<P>whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons; for though

<P>he may preach himself into a good-humour every Sunday,

<P>it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green

<P>geese from Monday morning till Saturday night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,"

<P>said Edmund affectionately, "must be beyond the reach

<P>of any sermons."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss

<P>Crawford had only time to say, in a pleasant manner,

<P>"I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve

<P>praise than to hear it"; when, being earnestly invited

<P>by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off

<P>to the instrument, leaving Edmund looking after her

<P>in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues,

<P>from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There goes good-humour, I am sure," said he presently.

<P>"There goes a temper which would never give pain!

<P>How well she walks! and how readily she falls in with the

<P>inclination of others! joining them the moment she is asked.

<P>What a pity," he added, after an instant's reflection,

<P>"that she should have been in such hands!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue

<P>at the window with her, in spite of the expected glee;

<P>and of having his eyes soon turned, like hers, towards the

<P>scene without, where all that was solemn, and soothing,

<P>and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night,

<P>and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods.&nbsp; Fanny spoke

<P>her feelings.&nbsp; "Here's harmony!" said she; "here's repose!

<P>Here's what may leave all painting and all music behind,

<P>and what poetry only can attempt to describe!&nbsp; Here's what

<P>may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture!

<P>When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if there

<P>could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;

<P>and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity

<P>of Nature were more attended to, and people were carried

<P>more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny.&nbsp; It is a lovely night,

<P>and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught

<P>to feel, in some degree, as you do; who have not,

<P>at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life.

<P>They lose a great deal."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had a very apt scholar.&nbsp; There's Arcturus looking

<P>very bright."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and the Bear.&nbsp; I wish I could see Cassiopeia."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must go out on the lawn for that.&nbsp; Should you be afraid?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not in the least.&nbsp; It is a great while since we have

<P>had any star-gazing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; I do not know how it has happened."&nbsp; The glee began.

<P>"We will stay till this is finished, Fanny," said he,

<P>turning his back on the window; and as it advanced,

<P>she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,

<P>moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument,

<P>and when it ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most

<P>urgent in requesting to hear the glee again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away

<P>by Mrs. Norris's threats of catching cold.
