<P>The intercourse of the two families was at this period

<P>more nearly restored to what it had been in the autumn,

<P>than any member of the old intimacy had thought ever

<P>likely to be again.&nbsp; The return of Henry Crawford,

<P>and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it,

<P>but much was still owing to Sir Thomas's more than toleration

<P>of the neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage.&nbsp; His mind,

<P>now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him

<P>at first, was at leisure to find the Grants and their

<P>young inmates really worth visiting; and though infinitely

<P>above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous

<P>matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent

<P>possibilities of any one most dear to him, and disdaining

<P>even as a littleness the being quick-sighted on such points,

<P>he could not avoid perceiving, in a grand and careless way,

<P>that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece--

<P>nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously) from giving a

<P>more willing assent to invitations on that account.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage,

<P>when the general invitation was at last hazarded,

<P>after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were

<P>worth while, "because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined,

<P>and Lady Bertram was so indolent!" proceeded from

<P>good-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do

<P>with Mr. Crawford, but as being one in an agreeable group:

<P>for it was in the course of that very visit that he first

<P>began to think that any one in the habit of such idle

<P>observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr. Crawford

<P>was the admirer of Fanny Price.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one,

<P>being composed in a good proportion of those who would talk

<P>and those who would listen; and the dinner itself was elegant

<P>and plentiful, according to the usual style of the Grants,

<P>and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise

<P>any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold

<P>either the wide table or the number of dishes on it

<P>with patience, and who did always contrive to experience

<P>some evil from the passing of the servants behind her chair,

<P>and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being

<P>impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination

<P>of Mrs. Grant and her sister, that after making up

<P>the whist-table there would remain sufficient for a

<P>round game, and everybody being as perfectly complying

<P>and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,

<P>speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist;

<P>and Lady Bertram soon found herself in the critical situation

<P>of being applied to for her own choice between the games,

<P>and being required either to draw a card for whist or not.

<P>She hesitated.&nbsp; Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What shall I do, Sir Thomas?&nbsp; Whist and speculation;

<P>which will amuse me most?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas, after a moment's thought, recommended speculation.

<P>He was a whist player himself, and perhaps might feel

<P>that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well," was her ladyship's contented answer;

<P>"then speculation, if you please, Mrs. Grant.&nbsp; I know

<P>nothing about it, but Fanny must teach me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations

<P>of her own equal ignorance; she had never played the

<P>game nor seen it played in her life; and Lady Bertram

<P>felt a moment's indecision again; but upon everybody's

<P>assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it

<P>was the easiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford's

<P>stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed

<P>to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price, and teach

<P>them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs. Norris,

<P>and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime

<P>intellectual state and dignity, the remaining six,

<P>under Miss Crawford's direction, were arranged round

<P>the other.&nbsp; It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford,

<P>who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full of business,

<P>having two persons' cards to manage as well as his own;

<P>for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself

<P>mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes,

<P>he had yet to inspirit her play, sharpen her avarice,

<P>and harden her heart, which, especially in any competition

<P>with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for

<P>Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame

<P>and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough

<P>to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began,

<P>must direct her in whatever was to be done with them

<P>to the end of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease,

<P>and preeminent in all the lively turns, quick resources,

<P>and playful impudence that could do honour to the game;

<P>and the round table was altogether a very comfortable

<P>contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of

<P>the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and

<P>success of his lady, but in vain; no pause was long enough

<P>for the time his measured manner needed; and very little

<P>of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able,

<P>at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay

<P>her compliments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed.&nbsp; A very odd game.

<P>I do not know what it is all about.&nbsp; I am never to see

<P>my cards; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bertram," said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the

<P>opportunity of a little languor in the game, "I have never

<P>told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home."

<P>They had been hunting together, and were in the midst of a

<P>good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, when his horse

<P>being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been

<P>obliged to give up, and make the best of his way back.

<P>"I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse

<P>with the yew-trees, because I can never bear to ask;

<P>but I have not told you that, with my usual luck--for I

<P>never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in due

<P>time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see.

<P>I was suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish

<P>downy field, in the midst of a retired little village

<P>between gently rising hills; a small stream before me to

<P>be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right--

<P>which church was strikingly large and handsome for

<P>the place, and not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house

<P>to be seen excepting one--to be presumed the Parsonage--

<P>within a stone's throw of the said knoll and church.

<P>I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It sounds like it," said Edmund; "but which way did you

<P>turn after passing Sewell's farm?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions;

<P>though were I to answer all that you could put in the course

<P>of an hour, you would never be able to prove that it

<P>was _not_ Thornton Lacey--for such it certainly was."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You inquired, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I never inquire.&nbsp; But I _told_ a man mending a hedge

<P>that it was Thornton Lacey, and he agreed to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have a good memory.&nbsp; I had forgotten having ever

<P>told you half so much of the place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thornton Lacey was the name of his impending living,

<P>as Miss Crawford well knew; and her interest in a negotiation

<P>for William Price's knave increased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," continued Edmund, "and how did you like what

<P>you saw?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very much indeed.&nbsp; You are a lucky fellow.&nbsp; There will be

<P>work for five summers at least before the place is liveable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, not so bad as that.&nbsp; The farmyard must be moved,

<P>I grant you; but I am not aware of anything else.

<P>The house is by no means bad, and when the yard is removed,

<P>there may be a very tolerable approach to it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted

<P>up to shut out the blacksmith's shop.&nbsp; The house must

<P>be turned to front the east instead of the north--

<P>the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be on

<P>that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am

<P>sure it may be done.&nbsp; And _there_ must be your approach,

<P>through what is at present the garden.&nbsp; You must make

<P>a new garden at what is now the back of the house;

<P>which will be giving it the best aspect in the world,

<P>sloping to the south-east. The ground seems precisely

<P>formed for it.&nbsp; I rode fifty yards up the lane,

<P>between the church and the house, in order to look about me;

<P>and saw how it might all be.&nbsp; Nothing can be easier.

<P>The meadows beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well

<P>as what now _is_, sweeping round from the lane I stood

<P>in to the north-east, that is, to the principal road

<P>through the village, must be all laid together, of course;

<P>very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber.

<P>They belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must

<P>purchase them.&nbsp; Then the stream--something must be done

<P>with the stream; but I could not quite determine what.

<P>I had two or three ideas."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I have two or three ideas also," said Edmund,

<P>"and one of them is, that very little of your plan

<P>for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice.

<P>I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty.

<P>I think the house and premises may be made comfortable,

<P>and given the air of a gentleman's residence, without any

<P>very heavy expense, and that must suffice me; and, I hope,

<P>may suffice all who care about me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a

<P>certain tone of voice, and a certain half-look attending

<P>the last expression of his hope, made a hasty finish

<P>of her dealings with William Price; and securing his knave

<P>at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, "There, I will stake

<P>my last like a woman of spirit.&nbsp; No cold prudence for me.

<P>I am not born to sit still and do nothing.&nbsp; If I lose

<P>the game, it shall not be from not striving for it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The game was hers, and only did not pay her for what

<P>she had given to secure it.&nbsp; Another deal proceeded,

<P>and Crawford began again about Thornton Lacey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My plan may not be the best possible:&nbsp; I had not many

<P>minutes to form it in; but you must do a good deal.

<P>The place deserves it, and you will find yourself not

<P>satisfied with much less than it is capable of.&nbsp; (Excuse me,

<P>your ladyship must not see your cards.&nbsp; There, let them

<P>lie just before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram.

<P>You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman's residence.

<P>_That_ will be done by the removal of the farmyard;

<P>for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw

<P>a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air

<P>of a gentleman's residence, so much the look of a something

<P>above a mere parsonage-house--above the expenditure of a few

<P>hundreds a year.&nbsp; It is not a scrambling collection of low

<P>single rooms, with as many roofs as windows; it is not

<P>cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse:

<P>it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one

<P>might suppose a respectable old country family had lived

<P>in from generation to generation, through two centuries

<P>at least, and were now spending from two to three thousand

<P>a year in."&nbsp; Miss Crawford listened, and Edmund agreed

<P>to this.&nbsp; "The air of a gentleman's residence, therefore,

<P>you cannot but give it, if you do anything.&nbsp; But it is

<P>capable of much more.&nbsp; (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram

<P>bids a dozen for that queen; no, no, a dozen is more

<P>than it is worth.&nbsp; Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen.

<P>She will have nothing to say to it.&nbsp; Go on, go on.)

<P>By some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really

<P>require you to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye,

<P>I doubt anybody's striking out a better) you may give it

<P>a higher character.&nbsp; You may raise it into a _place_.

<P>From being the mere gentleman's residence, it becomes,

<P>by judicious improvement, the residence of a man

<P>of education, taste, modern manners, good connexions.

<P>All this may be stamped on it; and that house receive

<P>such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great

<P>landholder of the parish by every creature travelling

<P>the road; especially as there is no real squire's house

<P>to dispute the point--a circumstance, between ourselves,

<P>to enhance the value of such a situation in point

<P>of privilege and independence beyond all calculation.

<P>_You_ think with me, I hope" (turning with a softened

<P>voice to Fanny). "Have you ever seen the place?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her interest

<P>in the subject by an eager attention to her brother,

<P>who was driving as hard a bargain, and imposing on her

<P>as much as he could; but Crawford pursued with "No, no,

<P>you must not part with the queen.&nbsp; You have bought

<P>her too dearly, and your brother does not offer half

<P>her value.&nbsp; No, no, sir, hands off, hands off.&nbsp; Your sister

<P>does not part with the queen.&nbsp; She is quite determined.

<P>The game will be yours," turning to her again; "it will

<P>certainly be yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And Fanny had much rather it were William's," said Edmund,

<P>smiling at her.&nbsp; "Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself

<P>as she wishes!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Bertram," said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards,

<P>"you know Henry to be such a capital improver, that you

<P>cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton

<P>Lacey without accepting his help.&nbsp; Only think how useful

<P>he was at Sotherton!&nbsp; Only think what grand things were

<P>produced there by our all going with him one hot day

<P>in August to drive about the grounds, and see his genius

<P>take fire.&nbsp; There we went, and there we came home again;

<P>and what was done there is not to be told!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment

<P>with an expression more than grave--even reproachful;

<P>but on catching his, were instantly withdrawn.

<P>With something of consciousness he shook his head at

<P>his sister, and laughingly replied, "I cannot say there

<P>was much done at Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we

<P>were all walking after each other, and bewildered."

<P>As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he added,

<P>in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, "I should be

<P>sorry to have my powers of _planning_ judged of by the

<P>day at Sotherton.&nbsp; I see things very differently now.

<P>Do not think of me as I appeared then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being

<P>just then in the happy leisure which followed securing

<P>the odd trick by Sir Thomas's capital play and her own

<P>against Dr. and Mrs. Grant's great hands, she called out,

<P>in high good-humour, "Sotherton!&nbsp; Yes, that is a place,

<P>indeed, and we had a charming day there.&nbsp; William, you are

<P>quite out of luck; but the next time you come, I hope dear

<P>Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home, and I am sure

<P>I can answer for your being kindly received by both.

<P>Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations,

<P>and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man.&nbsp; They are at

<P>Brighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there,

<P>as Mr. Rushworth's fine fortune gives them a right to be.

<P>I do not exactly know the distance, but when you get back

<P>to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, you ought to go

<P>over and pay your respects to them; and I could send

<P>a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to

<P>your cousins."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost

<P>by Beachey Head; and if I could get so far, I could

<P>not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that--

<P>poor scrubby midshipman as I am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the

<P>affability he might depend on, when she was stopped

<P>by Sir Thomas's saying with authority, "I do not advise

<P>your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may soon

<P>have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my

<P>daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere;

<P>and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed

<P>to regard all the connexions of our family as his own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would rather find him private secretary to the First

<P>Lord than anything else," was William's only answer,

<P>in an undervoice, not meant to reach far, and the

<P>subject dropped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford's

<P>behaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end

<P>of the second rubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris

<P>to dispute over their last play, he became a looker-on

<P>at the other, he found his niece the object of attentions,

<P>or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed character.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme

<P>about Thornton Lacey; and not being able to catch

<P>Edmund's ear, was detailing it to his fair neighbour

<P>with a look of considerable earnestness.&nbsp; His scheme

<P>was to rent the house himself the following winter,

<P>that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood;

<P>and it was not merely for the use of it in the hunting-season

<P>(as he was then telling her), though _that_ consideration

<P>had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that,

<P>in spite of all Dr. Grant's very great kindness, it was

<P>impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated

<P>where they now were without material inconvenience;

<P>but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend

<P>upon one amusement or one season of the year:&nbsp; he had set

<P>his heart upon having a something there that he could

<P>come to at any time, a little homestall at his command,

<P>where all the holidays of his year might be spent, and he

<P>might find himself continuing, improving, and _perfecting_

<P>that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park

<P>family which was increasing in value to him every day.

<P>Sir Thomas heard and was not offended.&nbsp; There was no want

<P>of respect in the young man's address; and Fanny's reception

<P>of it was so proper and modest, so calm and uninviting,

<P>that he had nothing to censure in her.&nbsp; She said little,

<P>assented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination

<P>either of appropriating any part of the compliment to herself,

<P>or of strengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire.

<P>Finding by whom he was observed, Henry Crawford addressed

<P>himself on the same subject to Sir Thomas, in a more

<P>everyday tone, but still with feeling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have,

<P>perhaps, heard me telling Miss Price.&nbsp; May I hope

<P>for your acquiescence, and for your not influencing

<P>your son against such a tenant?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, "It is the only way,

<P>sir, in which I could _not_ wish you established as a

<P>permanent neighbour; but I hope, and believe, that Edmund will

<P>occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey.&nbsp; Edmund, am I saying too

<P>much?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on;

<P>but, on understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence.

<P>But, Crawford, though I refuse you as a tenant,

<P>come to me as a friend.&nbsp; Consider the house as half

<P>your own every winter, and we will add to the stables

<P>on your own improved plan, and with all the improvements

<P>of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We shall be the losers," continued Sir Thomas.

<P>"His going, though only eight miles, will be an unwelcome

<P>contraction of our family circle; but I should have been

<P>deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile

<P>himself to doing less.&nbsp; It is perfectly natural that you

<P>should not have thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford.

<P>But a parish has wants and claims which can be known

<P>only by a clergyman constantly resident, and which no

<P>proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent.

<P>Edmund might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton,

<P>that is, he might read prayers and preach, without giving

<P>up Mansfield Park:&nbsp; he might ride over every Sunday, to a

<P>house nominally inhabited, and go through divine service;

<P>he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day,

<P>for three or four hours, if that would content him.

<P>But it will not.&nbsp; He knows that human nature needs more

<P>lessons than a weekly sermon can convey; and that if he

<P>does not live among his parishioners, and prove himself,

<P>by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he does

<P>very little either for their good or his own."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I repeat again," added Sir Thomas, "that Thornton Lacey

<P>is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should

<P>_not_ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford bowed his thanks.

<P>"Sir Thomas," said Edmund, "undoubtedly understands

<P>the duty of a parish priest.&nbsp; We must hope his son

<P>may prove that _he_ knows it too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Whatever effect Sir Thomas's little harangue might really

<P>produce on Mr. Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations

<P>in two of the others, two of his most attentive listeners--

<P>Miss Crawford and Fanny.&nbsp; One of whom, having never before

<P>understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely

<P>to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it

<P>would be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other,

<P>startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously

<P>indulging on the strength of her brother's description,

<P>no longer able, in the picture she had been forming of a

<P>future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the clergyman,

<P>and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised,

<P>and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune,

<P>was considering Sir Thomas, with decided ill-will,

<P>as the destroyer of all this, and suffering the more

<P>from that involuntary forbearance which his character

<P>and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve

<P>herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All the agreeable of _her_ speculation was over for that hour.

<P>It was time to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed;

<P>and she was glad to find it necessary to come to a conclusion,

<P>and be able to refresh her spirits by a change of place

<P>and neighbour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The chief of the party were now collected irregularly

<P>round the fire, and waiting the final break-up. William

<P>and Fanny were the most detached.&nbsp; They remained

<P>together at the otherwise deserted card-table, talking

<P>very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some

<P>of the rest began to think of them.&nbsp; Henry Crawford's

<P>chair was the first to be given a direction towards them,

<P>and he sat silently observing them for a few minutes;

<P>himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas,

<P>who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is the assembly night," said William.&nbsp; "If I were

<P>at Portsmouth I should be at it, perhaps."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, Fanny, that I do not.&nbsp; I shall have enough of Portsmouth

<P>and of dancing too, when I cannot have you.&nbsp; And I do not

<P>know that there would be any good in going to the assembly,

<P>for I might not get a partner.&nbsp; The Portsmouth girls turn

<P>up their noses at anybody who has not a commission.

<P>One might as well be nothing as a midshipman.

<P>One _is_ nothing, indeed.&nbsp; You remember the Gregorys;

<P>they are grown up amazing fine girls, but they will hardly

<P>speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! shame, shame!&nbsp; But never mind it, William" (her own

<P>cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke). "It is not

<P>worth minding.&nbsp; It is no reflection on _you_; it is no

<P>more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced,

<P>more or less, in their time.&nbsp; You must think of that,

<P>you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the

<P>hardships which fall to every sailor's share, like bad

<P>weather and hard living, only with this advantage,

<P>that there will be an end to it, that there will come

<P>a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure.

<P>When you are a lieutenant! only think, William, when you

<P>are a lieutenant, how little you will care for any nonsense

<P>of this kind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny.

<P>Everybody gets made but me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding.

<P>My uncle says nothing, but I am sure he will do everything

<P>in his power to get you made.&nbsp; He knows, as well as you do,

<P>of what consequence it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer

<P>to them than she had any suspicion of, and each found

<P>it necessary to talk of something else.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very; only I am soon tired."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should like to go to a ball with you and see

<P>you dance.&nbsp; Have you never any balls at Northampton?

<P>I should like to see you dance, and I'd dance with you

<P>if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,

<P>and I should like to be your partner once more.

<P>We used to jump about together many a time, did not we?

<P>when the hand-organ was in the street?&nbsp; I am a pretty

<P>good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better."

<P>And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them,

<P>"Is not Fanny a very good dancer, sir?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question,

<P>did not know which way to look, or how to be prepared

<P>for the answer.&nbsp; Some very grave reproof, or at least

<P>the coldest expression of indifference, must be coming

<P>to distress her brother, and sink her to the ground.

<P>But, on the contrary, it was no worse than, "I am sorry

<P>to say that I am unable to answer your question.

<P>I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl;

<P>but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like

<P>a gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may

<P>have an opportunity of doing ere long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance,

<P>Mr. Price," said Henry Crawford, leaning forward,

<P>"and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can

<P>make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.

<P>But I believe" (seeing Fanny looked distressed) "it must

<P>be at some other time.&nbsp; There is _one_ person in company

<P>who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>True enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was

<P>equally true that he would now have answered for her gliding

<P>about with quiet, light elegance, and in admirable time;

<P>but, in fact, he could not for the life of him recall

<P>what her dancing had been, and rather took it for granted

<P>that she had been present than remembered anything about her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing;

<P>and Sir Thomas, by no means displeased, prolonged the

<P>conversation on dancing in general, and was so well

<P>engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and listening

<P>to what his nephew could relate of the different modes

<P>of dancing which had fallen within his observation,

<P>that he had not heard his carriage announced, and was first

<P>called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about?&nbsp; We are going.

<P>Do not you see your aunt is going?&nbsp; Quick, quick!&nbsp; I cannot

<P>bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting.&nbsp; You should always

<P>remember the coachman and horses.&nbsp; My dear Sir Thomas,

<P>we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you,

<P>and Edmund and William."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his

<P>own arrangement, previously communicated to his wife

<P>and sister; but _that_ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris,

<P>who must fancy that she settled it all herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment:

<P>for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the

<P>servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized

<P>by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she was obliged to be

<P>indebted to his more prominent attention.
