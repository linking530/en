<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed

<P>in town, and Fanny had heard nothing of him.

<P>There were three different conclusions to be drawn from

<P>his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation;

<P>each of them at times being held the most probable.

<P>Either his going had been again delayed, or he had yet

<P>procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone,

<P>or he was too happy for letter-writing!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly

<P>four weeks from Mansfield, a point which she never failed

<P>to think over and calculate every day, as she and Susan

<P>were preparing to remove, as usual, upstairs, they were

<P>stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they felt they could

<P>not avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to the door,

<P>a duty which always interested her beyond any other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a gentleman's voice; it was a voice that Fanny

<P>was just turning pale about, when Mr. Crawford walked

<P>into the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Good sense, like hers, will always act when really

<P>called upon; and she found that she had been able to name

<P>him to her mother, and recall her remembrance of the name,

<P>as that of "William's friend," though she could not

<P>previously have believed herself capable of uttering a

<P>syllable at such a moment.&nbsp; The consciousness of his being

<P>known there only as William's friend was some support.

<P>Having introduced him, however, and being all reseated,

<P>the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead

<P>to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point

<P>of fainting away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had

<P>at first approached her with as animated a countenance

<P>as ever, was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away,

<P>and giving her time to recover, while he devoted himself

<P>entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attending to

<P>her with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same

<P>time with a degree of friendliness, of interest at least,

<P>which was making his manner perfect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Price's manners were also at their best.&nbsp; Warmed by

<P>the sight of such a friend to her son, and regulated

<P>by the wish of appearing to advantage before him, she was

<P>overflowing with gratitude--artless, maternal gratitude--

<P>which could not be unpleasing.&nbsp; Mr. Price was out,

<P>which she regretted very much.&nbsp; Fanny was just recovered

<P>enough to feel that _she_ could not regret it; for to her

<P>many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe

<P>one of shame for the home in which he found her.

<P>She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was

<P>no scolding it away.&nbsp; She was ashamed, and she would have

<P>been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price

<P>could never tire; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his

<P>commendation as even her heart could wish.&nbsp; She felt

<P>that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life;

<P>and was only astonished to find that, so great and so

<P>agreeable as he was, he should be come down to Portsmouth

<P>neither on a visit to the port-admiral, nor the commissioner,

<P>nor yet with the intention of going over to the island,

<P>nor of seeing the dockyard.&nbsp; Nothing of all that she

<P>had been used to think of as the proof of importance,

<P>or the employment of wealth, had brought him to Portsmouth.

<P>He had reached it late the night before, was come for a

<P>day or two, was staying at the Crown, had accidentally

<P>met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since

<P>his arrival, but had no object of that kind in coming.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By the time he had given all this information, it was not

<P>unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at

<P>and spoken to; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye,

<P>and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister

<P>the evening before his leaving London; that she had sent

<P>her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing;

<P>that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half

<P>an hour, having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London,

<P>after his return from Norfolk, before he set off again;

<P>that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in town,

<P>he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself,

<P>but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield,

<P>and was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned

<P>circumstance; nay, it seemed a relief to her worn

<P>mind to be at any certainty; and the words, "then by

<P>this time it is all settled," passed internally,

<P>without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject

<P>in which her interest was most apparent, Crawford began

<P>to hint at the expediency of an early walk.&nbsp; "It was a

<P>lovely morning, and at that season of the year a fine morning

<P>so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody not

<P>to delay their exercise"; and such hints producing nothing,

<P>he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price

<P>and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time.

<P>Now they came to an understanding.&nbsp; Mrs. Price, it appeared,

<P>scarcely ever stirred out of doors, except of a Sunday;

<P>she owned she could seldom, with her large family,

<P>find time for a walk.&nbsp; "Would she not, then, persuade her

<P>daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow

<P>him the pleasure of attending them?"&nbsp; Mrs. Price was

<P>greatly obliged and very complying.&nbsp; "Her daughters

<P>were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;

<P>they did not often get out; and she knew they had some

<P>errands in the town, which they would be very glad to do."

<P>And the consequence was, that Fanny, strange as it was--

<P>strange, awkward, and distressing--found herself and Susan,

<P>within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street

<P>with Mr. Crawford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion;

<P>for they were hardly in the High Street before they met

<P>her father, whose appearance was not the better from its

<P>being Saturday.&nbsp; He stopt; and, ungentlemanlike as he looked,

<P>Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford.

<P>She could not have a doubt of the manner in which

<P>Mr. Crawford must be struck.&nbsp; He must be ashamed

<P>and disgusted altogether.&nbsp; He must soon give her up,

<P>and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match;

<P>and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection

<P>to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost

<P>as bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely

<P>a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather

<P>put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever,

<P>agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity

<P>of her nearest relations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future

<P>father-in-law with any idea of taking him for a model

<P>in dress; but (as Fanny instantly, and to her great

<P>relief, discerned) her father was a very different man,

<P>a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most

<P>highly respected stranger, from what he was in his own

<P>family at home.&nbsp; His manners now, though not polished,

<P>were more than passable:&nbsp; they were grateful, animated, manly;

<P>his expressions were those of an attached father,

<P>and a sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the

<P>open air, and there was not a single oath to be heard.

<P>Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners

<P>of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it might,

<P>Fanny's immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The conclusion of the two gentlemen's civilities was an offer

<P>of Mr. Price's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard,

<P>which Mr. Crawford, desirous of accepting as a favour

<P>what was intended as such, though he had seen the dockyard

<P>again and again, and hoping to be so much the longer

<P>with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of,

<P>if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue;

<P>and as it was somehow or other ascertained, or inferred,

<P>or at least acted upon, that they were not at all afraid,

<P>to the dockyard they were all to go; and but for

<P>Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly,

<P>without the smallest consideration for his daughters'

<P>errands in the High Street.&nbsp; He took care, however, that they

<P>should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly

<P>to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny could

<P>so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for,

<P>that before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door,

<P>could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations,

<P>or settle the number of three-deckers now in commission,

<P>their companions were ready to proceed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once,

<P>and the walk would have been conducted--according to

<P>Mr. Crawford's opinion--in a singular manner,

<P>had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,

<P>as the two girls, he found, would have been left

<P>to follow, and keep up with them or not, as they could,

<P>while they walked on together at their own hasty pace.

<P>He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally,

<P>though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely

<P>would not walk away from them; and at any crossing

<P>or any crowd, when Mr. Price was only calling out,

<P>"Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of yourselves;

<P>keep a sharp lookout!" he would give them his particular

<P>attendance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon

<P>some happy intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon

<P>joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price's, who was come

<P>to take his daily survey of how things went on, and who

<P>must prove a far more worthy companion than himself;

<P>and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied

<P>going about together, and discussing matters of equal

<P>and never-failing interest, while the young people sat down

<P>upon some timbers in the yard, or found a seat on board

<P>a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at.

<P>Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest.&nbsp; Crawford could

<P>not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down;

<P>but he could have wished her sister away.&nbsp; A quick-looking

<P>girl of Susan's age was the very worst third in the world:

<P>totally different from Lady Bertram, all eyes and ears;

<P>and there was no introducing the main point before her.

<P>He must content himself with being only generally agreeable,

<P>and letting Susan have her share of entertainment,

<P>with the indulgence, now and then, of a look or hint

<P>for the better-informed and conscious Fanny.&nbsp; Norfolk was

<P>what he had mostly to talk of:&nbsp; there he had been some time,

<P>and everything there was rising in importance from his

<P>present schemes.&nbsp; Such a man could come from no place,

<P>no society, without importing something to amuse;

<P>his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use,

<P>and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her.

<P>For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental

<P>agreeableness of the parties he had been in.

<P>For her approbation, the particular reason of his going into

<P>Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year, was given.

<P>It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a

<P>lease in which the welfare of a large and--he believed--

<P>industrious family was at stake.&nbsp; He had suspected his

<P>agent of some underhand dealing; of meaning to bias him

<P>against the deserving; and he had determined to go himself,

<P>and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case.

<P>He had gone, had done even more good than he had foreseen,

<P>had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended,

<P>and was now able to congratulate himself upon it, and to

<P>feel that in performing a duty, he had secured agreeable

<P>recollections for his own mind.&nbsp; He had introduced himself

<P>to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun

<P>making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence,

<P>though on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him.

<P>This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny.&nbsp; It was pleasing

<P>to hear him speak so properly; here he had been acting

<P>as he ought to do.&nbsp; To be the friend of the poor and

<P>the oppressed!&nbsp; Nothing could be more grateful to her;

<P>and she was on the point of giving him an approving look,

<P>when it was all frightened off by his adding a something

<P>too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant,

<P>a friend, a guide in every plan of utility or charity

<P>for Everingham:&nbsp; a somebody that would make Everingham

<P>and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been

<P>yet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She turned away, and wished he would not say such things.

<P>She was willing to allow he might have more good

<P>qualities than she had been wont to suppose.&nbsp; She began

<P>to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last;

<P>but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her,

<P>and ought not to think of her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham,

<P>and that it would be as well to talk of something else,

<P>and turned to Mansfield.&nbsp; He could not have chosen better;

<P>that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks

<P>almost instantly.&nbsp; It was a real indulgence to her to hear

<P>or to speak of Mansfield.&nbsp; Now so long divided from

<P>everybody who knew the place, she felt it quite the voice

<P>of a friend when he mentioned it, and led the way to her

<P>fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts,

<P>and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed

<P>her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium,

<P>in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good,

<P>and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so;

<P>he looked forward with the hope of spending much, very much,

<P>of his time there; always there, or in the neighbourhood.

<P>He particularly built upon a very happy summer and

<P>autumn there this year; he felt that it would be so:

<P>he depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior

<P>to the last.&nbsp; As animated, as diversified, as social,

<P>but with circumstances of superiority undescribable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey," he continued;

<P>"what a society will be comprised in those houses!

<P>And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth may be added:

<P>some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so dear;

<P>for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund

<P>Bertram once good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee

<P>two objections:&nbsp; two fair, excellent, irresistible objections

<P>to that plan."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment

<P>was passed, could regret that she had not forced herself into

<P>the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning,

<P>and encouraged him to say something more of his sister

<P>and Edmund.&nbsp; It was a subject which she must learn to speak of,

<P>and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite

<P>unpardonable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished,

<P>or had time for, the others were ready to return;

<P>and in the course of their walk back, Mr. Crawford contrived

<P>a minute's privacy for telling Fanny that his only

<P>business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come

<P>down for a couple of days on her account, and hers only,

<P>and because he could not endure a longer total separation.

<P>She was sorry, really sorry; and yet in spite of this and the

<P>two or three other things which she wished he had not said,

<P>she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him;

<P>he was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to other

<P>people's feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield;

<P>she had never seen him so agreeable--so _near_ being agreeable;

<P>his behaviour to her father could not offend, and there

<P>was something particularly kind and proper in the notice

<P>he took of Susan.&nbsp; He was decidedly improved.&nbsp; She wished

<P>the next day over, she wished he had come only for one day;

<P>but it was not so very bad as she would have expected:

<P>the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very great!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure,

<P>and one of no trivial kind.&nbsp; Her father asked him to do

<P>them the honour of taking his mutton with them, and Fanny

<P>had time for only one thrill of horror, before he declared

<P>himself prevented by a prior engagement.&nbsp; He was engaged

<P>to dinner already both for that day and the next; he had met

<P>with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied;

<P>he should have the honour, however, of waiting on them

<P>again on the morrow, etc., and so they parted--Fanny in

<P>a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To have had him join their family dinner-party, and see

<P>all their deficiencies, would have been dreadful!

<P>Rebecca's cookery and Rebecca's waiting, and Betsey's

<P>eating at table without restraint, and pulling everything

<P>about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet

<P>enough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal.

<P>_She_ was nice only from natural delicacy, but _he_ had been

<P>brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism.
