<P>"But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?" said Lady Bertram.

<P>"How came she to think of asking Fanny?&nbsp; Fanny never

<P>dines there, you know, in this sort of way.&nbsp; I cannot

<P>spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go.

<P>Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you put such a question to her," cried Edmund,

<P>preventing his cousin's speaking, "Fanny will immediately

<P>say No; but I am sure, my dear mother, she would like to go;

<P>and I can see no reason why she should not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her?

<P>She never did before.&nbsp; She used to ask your sisters now

<P>and then, but she never asked Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you cannot do without me, ma'am--" said Fanny,

<P>in a self-denying tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But my mother will have my father with her all the evening."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure, so I shall."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suppose you take my father's opinion, ma'am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's well thought of.&nbsp; So I will, Edmund.&nbsp; I will

<P>ask Sir Thomas, as soon as he comes in, whether I can

<P>do without her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As you please, ma'am, on that head; but I meant my

<P>father's opinion as to the _propriety_ of the invitation's

<P>being accepted or not; and I think he will consider

<P>it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by Fanny,

<P>that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; We will ask him.&nbsp; But he will be very

<P>much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was nothing more to be said, or that could be

<P>said to any purpose, till Sir Thomas were present;

<P>but the subject involving, as it did, her own evening's

<P>comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in Lady

<P>Bertram's mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his

<P>looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation

<P>to his dressing-room, she called him back again,

<P>when he had almost closed the door, with "Sir Thomas,

<P>stop a moment--I have something to say to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble

<P>of raising her voice, was always heard and attended to;

<P>and Sir Thomas came back.&nbsp; Her story began; and Fanny

<P>immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear herself

<P>the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more

<P>than her nerves could bear.&nbsp; She was anxious, she knew--

<P>more anxious perhaps than she ought to be--for what was

<P>it after all whether she went or staid? but if her uncle

<P>were to be a great while considering and deciding,

<P>and with very grave looks, and those grave looks directed

<P>to her, and at last decide against her, she might not

<P>be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent.

<P>Her cause, meanwhile, went on well.&nbsp; It began, on Lady

<P>Bertram's part, with--"I have something to tell you

<P>that will surprise you.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny

<P>to dinner."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish

<P>the surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Edmund wants her to go.&nbsp; But how can I spare her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She will be late," said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch;

<P>"but what is your difficulty?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up

<P>the blanks in his mother's story.&nbsp; He told the whole;

<P>and she had only to add, "So strange! for Mrs. Grant

<P>never used to ask her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But is it not very natural," observed Edmund,

<P>"that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable

<P>a visitor for her sister?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing can be more natural," said Sir Thomas, after a

<P>short deliberation; "nor, were there no sister in the case,

<P>could anything, in my opinion, be more natural.

<P>Mrs. Grant's shewing civility to Miss Price, to Lady

<P>Bertram's niece, could never want explanation.&nbsp; The only

<P>surprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_

<P>time of its being paid.&nbsp; Fanny was perfectly right in

<P>giving only a conditional answer.&nbsp; She appears to feel

<P>as she ought.&nbsp; But as I conclude that she must wish to go,

<P>since all young people like to be together, I can see

<P>no reason why she should be denied the indulgence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed I think you may."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend

<P>the day with us, and I shall certainly be at home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The good news soon followed her.&nbsp; Edmund knocked at her

<P>door in his way to his own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without

<P>the smallest hesitation on your uncle's side.

<P>He had but one opinion.&nbsp; You are to go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, I am _so_ glad," was Fanny's instinctive reply;

<P>though when she had turned from him and shut the door,

<P>she could not help feeling, "And yet why should I be glad?

<P>for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there

<P>to pain me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of this conviction, however, she was glad.

<P>Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes,

<P>it had novelty and importance in hers, for excepting the

<P>day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dined out before;

<P>and though now going only half a mile, and only to

<P>three people, still it was dining out, and all the little

<P>interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves.

<P>She had neither sympathy nor assistance from those who ought

<P>to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste;

<P>for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody,

<P>and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence

<P>of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in

<P>a very ill humour, and seemed intent only on lessening

<P>her niece's pleasure, both present and future, as much

<P>as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet

<P>with such attention and indulgence!&nbsp; You ought to be

<P>very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you,

<P>and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to look

<P>upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are

<P>aware that there is no real occasion for your going into

<P>company in this sort of way, or ever dining out at all;

<P>and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated.

<P>Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant

<P>as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment

<P>is intended to your uncle and aunt and me.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant

<P>thinks it a civility due to _us_ to take a little notice

<P>of you, or else it would never have come into her head,

<P>and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia

<P>had been at home, you would not have been asked at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all

<P>Mrs. Grant's part of the favour, that Fanny, who found

<P>herself expected to speak, could only say that she was

<P>very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,

<P>and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt's evening

<P>work in such a state as to prevent her being missed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you,

<P>or you would not be allowed to go.&nbsp; _I_ shall be here, so you

<P>may be quite easy about your aunt.&nbsp; And I hope you will have

<P>a very _agreeable_ day, and find it all mighty _delightful_.

<P>But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of

<P>all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I cannot

<P>but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant

<P>should not contrive better!&nbsp; And round their enormous great

<P>wide table, too, which fills up the room so dreadfully!

<P>Had the doctor been contented to take my dining-table when I

<P>came away, as anybody in their senses would have done,

<P>instead of having that absurd new one of his own,

<P>which is wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here,

<P>how infinitely better it would have been! and how much

<P>more he would have been respected! for people are never

<P>respected when they step out of their proper sphere.

<P>Remember that, Fanny.&nbsp; Five--only five to be sitting

<P>round that table.&nbsp; However, you will have dinner enough

<P>on it for ten, I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their

<P>rank and trying to appear above themselves, makes me

<P>think it right to give _you_ a hint, Fanny, now that you

<P>are going into company without any of us; and I do beseech

<P>and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward,

<P>and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of

<P>your cousins--as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia.

<P>_That_ will never do, believe me.&nbsp; Remember, wherever you are,

<P>you must be the lowest and last; and though Miss Crawford

<P>is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are not to

<P>be taking place of her.&nbsp; And as to coming away at night,

<P>you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses.

<P>Leave him to settle _that_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, ma'am, I should not think of anything else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely,

<P>for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening

<P>in my life, you must manage as well as you can, and not be

<P>expecting the carriage to be sent for you.&nbsp; I certainly

<P>do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will

<P>not be out on my account; so you must make up your mind

<P>to what may happen, and take your things accordingly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable.&nbsp; She rated her

<P>own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could;

<P>and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards, just opening

<P>the door, said, "Fanny, at what time would you have the

<P>carriage come round?" she felt a degree of astonishment

<P>which made it impossible for her to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Sir Thomas!" cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger,

<P>"Fanny can walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Walk!" repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable

<P>dignity, and coming farther into the room.&nbsp; "My niece

<P>walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year!

<P>Will twenty minutes after four suit you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir," was Fanny's humble answer, given with the

<P>feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris;

<P>and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem

<P>a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of the room,

<P>having staid behind him only long enough to hear these

<P>words spoken in angry agitation--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind!

<P>But Edmund goes; true, it is upon Edmund's account.

<P>I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this could not impose on Fanny.&nbsp; She felt that

<P>the carriage was for herself, and herself alone:

<P>and her uncle's consideration of her, coming immediately

<P>after such representations from her aunt, cost her

<P>some tears of gratitude when she was alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute

<P>brought down the gentleman; and as the lady had, with a

<P>most scrupulous fear of being late, been many minutes

<P>seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them off

<P>in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now I must look at you, Fanny," said Edmund, with the

<P>kind smile of an affectionate brother, "and tell you

<P>how I like you; and as well as I can judge by this light,

<P>you look very nicely indeed.&nbsp; What have you got on?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me

<P>on my cousin's marriage.&nbsp; I hope it is not too fine; but I

<P>thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could, and that I

<P>might not have such another opportunity all the winter.

<P>I hope you do not think me too fine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white.&nbsp; No,
I

<P>see

<P>no finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper.

<P>Your gown seems very pretty.&nbsp; I like these glossy spots.

<P>Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the

<P>stable-yard and coach-house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Heyday!" said Edmund, "here's company, here's a carriage!

<P>who have they got to meet us?"&nbsp; And letting down the side-glass

<P>to distinguish, "'Tis Crawford's, Crawford's barouche,

<P>I protest!&nbsp; There are his own two men pushing it back

<P>into its old quarters.&nbsp; He is here, of course.&nbsp; This is

<P>quite a surprise, Fanny.&nbsp; I shall be very glad to see him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny

<P>to say how very differently she felt; but the idea

<P>of having such another to observe her was a great

<P>increase of the trepidation with which she performed

<P>the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been

<P>just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the

<P>smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing

<P>round him, shewed how welcome was his sudden resolution

<P>of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.

<P>A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund;

<P>and with the exception of Fanny, the pleasure was general;

<P>and even to _her_ there might be some advantage in

<P>his presence, since every addition to the party must

<P>rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered

<P>to sit silent and unattended to.&nbsp; She was soon aware

<P>of this herself; for though she must submit, as her

<P>own propriety of mind directed, in spite of her aunt

<P>Norris's opinion, to being the principal lady in company,

<P>and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon,

<P>she found, while they were at table, such a happy flow

<P>of conversation prevailing, in which she was not required

<P>to take any part--there was so much to be said between

<P>the brother and sister about Bath, so much between

<P>the two young men about hunting, so much of politics

<P>between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant, and of everything

<P>and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant,

<P>as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to

<P>listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day.

<P>She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman,

<P>however, with any appearance of interest, in a scheme

<P>for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending for his

<P>hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant,

<P>advised by Edmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters,

<P>was soon in possession of his mind, and which he seemed

<P>to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on.

<P>Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance

<P>of the open weather, but her answers were as short

<P>and indifferent as civility allowed.&nbsp; She could not wish

<P>him to stay, and would much rather not have him speak

<P>to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her

<P>thoughts on seeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance

<P>affected _his_ spirits.&nbsp; Here he was again on the same

<P>ground where all had passed before, and apparently as

<P>willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,

<P>as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state.

<P>She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way,

<P>till they were all re-assembled in the drawing-room,

<P>when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of business

<P>with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them,

<P>and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he began talking

<P>of them with more particularity to his other sister.

<P>With a significant smile, which made Fanny quite hate him,

<P>he said, "So!&nbsp; Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton,

<P>I understand; happy man!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price,

<P>have they not?&nbsp; And Julia is with them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mr. Yates!&nbsp; Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates.&nbsp; I do not

<P>imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park;

<P>do you, Miss Price?&nbsp; I think my friend Julia knows better

<P>than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches!"

<P>continued Crawford.&nbsp; "Nobody can ever forget them.

<P>Poor fellow!&nbsp; I see him now--his toil and his despair.

<P>Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever

<P>want him to make two-and-forty speeches to her"; adding,

<P>with a momentary seriousness, "She is too good for him--

<P>much too good."&nbsp; And then changing his tone again to one

<P>of gentle gallantry, and addressing Fanny, he said,

<P>"You were Mr. Rushworth's best friend.&nbsp; Your kindness and

<P>patience can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience

<P>in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part--

<P>in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied--

<P>to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity

<P>of your own!&nbsp; _He_ might not have sense enough himself

<P>to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it

<P>had honour from all the rest of the party."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny coloured, and said nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!" he exclaimed,

<P>breaking forth again, after a few minutes' musing.&nbsp; "I shall

<P>always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure.

<P>There was such an interest, such an animation, such a

<P>spirit diffused.&nbsp; Everybody felt it.&nbsp; We were all alive.

<P>There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every

<P>hour of the day.&nbsp; Always some little objection,

<P>some little doubt, some little anxiety to be got over.

<P>I never was happier."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself,

<P>"Never happier!--never happier than when doing what

<P>you must know was not justifiable!--never happier

<P>than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly!

<P>Oh! what a corrupted mind!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were unlucky, Miss Price," he continued, in a lower tone,

<P>to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund,

<P>and not at all aware of her feelings, "we certainly

<P>were very unlucky.&nbsp; Another week, only one other week,

<P>would have been enough for us.&nbsp; I think if we had had the

<P>disposal of events--if Mansfield Park had had the government

<P>of the winds just for a week or two, about the equinox,

<P>there would have been a difference.&nbsp; Not that we would

<P>have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather--

<P>but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm.&nbsp; I think,

<P>Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week's

<P>calm in the Atlantic at that season."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny,

<P>averting her face, said, with a firmer tone than usual,

<P>"As far as _I_ am concerned, sir, I would not have

<P>delayed his return for a day.&nbsp; My uncle disapproved it

<P>all so entirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion

<P>everything had gone quite far enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before,

<P>and never so angrily to any one; and when her speech was over,

<P>she trembled and blushed at her own daring.&nbsp; He was surprised;

<P>but after a few moments' silent consideration of her,

<P>replied in a calmer, graver tone, and as if the candid

<P>result of conviction, "I believe you are right.&nbsp; It was

<P>more pleasant than prudent.&nbsp; We were getting too noisy."

<P>And then turning the conversation, he would have engaged

<P>her on some other subject, but her answers were so shy

<P>and reluctant that he could not advance in any.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant

<P>and Edmund, now observed, "Those gentlemen must have

<P>some very interesting point to discuss."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The most interesting in the world," replied her brother--

<P>"how to make money; how to turn a good income into a better.

<P>Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living

<P>he is to step into so soon.&nbsp; I find he takes orders

<P>in a few weeks.&nbsp; They were at it in the dining-parlour.

<P>I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off.&nbsp; He will

<P>have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with,

<P>and earned without much trouble.&nbsp; I apprehend he will

<P>not have less than seven hundred a year.&nbsp; Seven hundred

<P>a year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of

<P>course he will still live at home, it will be all for his

<P>_menus_ _plaisirs_; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter,

<P>I suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying,

<P>"Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody

<P>settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less

<P>than themselves.&nbsp; You would look rather blank, Henry, if your

<P>_menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven hundred a year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is

<P>entirely comparative.&nbsp; Birthright and habit must settle

<P>the business.&nbsp; Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet

<P>of even a baronet's family.&nbsp; By the time he is four or five

<P>and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for

<P>it."

<P>Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would

<P>be a something to do and to suffer for it, which she

<P>could not think lightly of; but she checked herself

<P>and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned

<P>when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bertram," said Henry Crawford, "I shall make a point of

<P>coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon.

<P>I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner.

<P>When is it to be?&nbsp; Miss Price, will not you join me in

<P>encouraging your cousin?&nbsp; Will not you engage to attend

<P>with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time--

<P>as I shall do--not to lose a word; or only looking off

<P>just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful?

<P>We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil.

<P>When will it be?&nbsp; You must preach at Mansfield, you know,

<P>that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,"

<P>said Edmund; "for you would be more likely to disconcert me,

<P>and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than

<P>almost any other man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will he not feel this?" thought Fanny.&nbsp; "No, he can feel

<P>nothing as he ought."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The party being now all united, and the chief talkers

<P>attracting each other, she remained in tranquillity;

<P>and as a whist-table was formed after tea--formed really

<P>for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his attentive wife,

<P>though it was not to be supposed so--and Miss Crawford

<P>took her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen;

<P>and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest

<P>of the evening, except when Mr. Crawford now and then

<P>addressed to her a question or observation, which she

<P>could not avoid answering.&nbsp; Miss Crawford was too much

<P>vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything

<P>but music.&nbsp; With that she soothed herself and amused

<P>her friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The assurance of Edmund's being so soon to take orders,

<P>coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended,

<P>and still hoped uncertain and at a distance, was felt

<P>with resentment and mortification.&nbsp; She was very angry

<P>with him.&nbsp; She had thought her influence more.

<P>She _had_ begun to think of him; she felt that she had,

<P>with great regard, with almost decided intentions;

<P>but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings.

<P>It was plain that he could have no serious views, no true

<P>attachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he must

<P>know she would never stoop to.&nbsp; She would learn to match

<P>him in his indifference.&nbsp; She would henceforth admit his

<P>attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement.

<P>If _he_ could so command his affections, _hers_ should do her

<P>no harm.
