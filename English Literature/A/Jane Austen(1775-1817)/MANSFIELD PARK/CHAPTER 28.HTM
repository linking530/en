<P>Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room

<P>when Fanny went down.&nbsp; To the former she was an interesting

<P>object, and he saw with pleasure the general elegance

<P>of her appearance, and her being in remarkably good looks.

<P>The neatness and propriety of her dress was all that

<P>he would allow himself to commend in her presence,

<P>but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards,

<P>he spoke of her beauty with very decided praise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Lady Bertram, "she looks very well.

<P>I sent Chapman to her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look well!&nbsp; Oh, yes!" cried Mrs. Norris, "she has

<P>good reason to look well with all her advantages:

<P>brought up in this family as she has been, with all

<P>the benefit of her cousins' manners before her.

<P>Only think, my dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary

<P>advantages you and I have been the means of giving her.

<P>The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own

<P>generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married.

<P>What would she have been if we had not taken her by

<P>the hand?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table

<P>the eyes of the two young men assured him that the subject

<P>might be gently touched again, when the ladies withdrew,

<P>with more success.&nbsp; Fanny saw that she was approved;

<P>and the consciousness of looking well made her look

<P>still better.&nbsp; From a variety of causes she was happy,

<P>and she was soon made still happier; for in following her

<P>aunts out of the room, Edmund, who was holding open the door,

<P>said, as she passed him, "You must dance with me, Fanny;

<P>you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,

<P>except the first."&nbsp; She had nothing more to wish for.

<P>She had hardly ever been in a state so nearly approaching

<P>high spirits in her life.&nbsp; Her cousins' former gaiety

<P>on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her;

<P>she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was actually

<P>practising her steps about the drawing-room as long as she

<P>could be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris, who was

<P>entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring

<P>the noble fire which the butler had prepared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid

<P>under any other circumstances, but Fanny's happiness

<P>still prevailed.&nbsp; It was but to think of her conversation

<P>with Edmund, and what was the restlessness of Mrs. Norris?

<P>What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet

<P>expectation of a carriage, when a general spirit of ease

<P>and enjoyment seemed diffused, and they all stood about

<P>and talked and laughed, and every moment had its pleasure

<P>and its hope.&nbsp; Fanny felt that there must be a struggle

<P>in Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see

<P>the effort so successfully made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began

<P>really to assemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued:

<P>the sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself;

<P>and besides the gravity and formality of the first great circle,

<P>which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady Bertram

<P>were of a kind to do away, she found herself occasionally

<P>called on to endure something worse.&nbsp; She was introduced

<P>here and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to,

<P>and to curtsey, and speak again.&nbsp; This was a hard duty,

<P>and she was never summoned to it without looking at William,

<P>as he walked about at his ease in the background of the scene,

<P>and longing to be with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch.

<P>The stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their

<P>popular manners and more diffused intimacies:&nbsp; little groups

<P>were formed, and everybody grew comfortable.&nbsp; Fanny felt

<P>the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils of civility,

<P>would have been again most happy, could she have kept

<P>her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford.

<P>_She_ looked all loveliness--and what might not be

<P>the end of it?&nbsp; Her own musings were brought to an end

<P>on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her thoughts

<P>were put into another channel by his engaging her almost

<P>instantly for the first two dances.&nbsp; Her happiness on this

<P>occasion was very much _a_ _la_ _mortal_, finely chequered.

<P>To be secure of a partner at first was a most essential good--

<P>for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near;

<P>and she so little understood her own claims as to think

<P>that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been

<P>the last to be sought after, and should have received

<P>a partner only through a series of inquiry, and bustle,

<P>and interference, which would have been terrible; but at

<P>the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking

<P>her which she did not like, and she saw his eye glancing

<P>for a moment at her necklace, with a smile--she thought

<P>there was a smile--which made her blush and feel wretched.

<P>And though there was no second glance to disturb her,

<P>though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable,

<P>she could not get the better of her embarrassment,

<P>heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it,

<P>and had no composure till he turned away to some one else.

<P>Then she could gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction

<P>of having a partner, a voluntary partner, secured against

<P>the dancing began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found

<P>herself for the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes

<P>and smiles were immediately and more unequivocally directed

<P>as her brother's had been, and who was beginning to speak

<P>on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to get the story over,

<P>hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace:

<P>the real chain.&nbsp; Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended

<P>compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten:

<P>she felt only one thing; and her eyes, bright as they

<P>had been before, shewing they could yet be brighter,

<P>she exclaimed with eager pleasure, "Did he?&nbsp; Did Edmund?

<P>That was like himself.&nbsp; No other man would have thought of it.

<P>I honour him beyond expression."&nbsp; And she looked around

<P>as if longing to tell him so.&nbsp; He was not near, he was

<P>attending a party of ladies out of the room; and Mrs. Grant

<P>coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,

<P>they followed with the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's heart sunk, but there was no leisure for

<P>thinking long even of Miss Crawford's feelings.

<P>They were in the ballroom, the violins were playing,

<P>and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on

<P>anything serious.&nbsp; She must watch the general arrangements,

<P>and see how everything was done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if

<P>she were engaged; and the "Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,"

<P>was exactly what he had intended to hear.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford

<P>was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,

<P>saying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_

<P>was to lead the way and open the ball; an idea that had

<P>never occurred to her before.&nbsp; Whenever she had thought

<P>of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as a matter

<P>of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford;

<P>and the impression was so strong, that though _her_ _uncle_

<P>spoke the contrary, she could not help an exclamation

<P>of surprise, a hint of her unfitness, an entreaty even to

<P>be excused.&nbsp; To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas's

<P>was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her

<P>horror at the first suggestion, that she could actually

<P>look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be

<P>settled otherwise; in vain, however:&nbsp; Sir Thomas smiled,

<P>tried to encourage her, and then looked too serious,

<P>and said too decidedly, "It must be so, my dear," for her

<P>to hazard another word; and she found herself the next

<P>moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room,

<P>and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers,

<P>couple after couple, as they were formed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could hardly believe it.&nbsp; To be placed above so many

<P>elegant young women!&nbsp; The distinction was too great.

<P>It was treating her like her cousins!&nbsp; And her thoughts

<P>flew to those absent cousins with most unfeigned and truly

<P>tender regret, that they were not at home to take their

<P>own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure

<P>which would have been so very delightful to them.

<P>So often as she had heard them wish for a ball at home

<P>as the greatest of all felicities!&nbsp; And to have them away

<P>when it was given--and for _her_ to be opening the ball--

<P>and with Mr. Crawford too!&nbsp; She hoped they would not envy

<P>her that distinction _now_; but when she looked back

<P>to the state of things in the autumn, to what they had all

<P>been to each other when once dancing in that house before,

<P>the present arrangement was almost more than she could

<P>understand herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ball began.&nbsp; It was rather honour than happiness

<P>to Fanny, for the first dance at least:&nbsp; her partner was

<P>in excellent spirits, and tried to impart them to her;

<P>but she was a great deal too much frightened to have

<P>any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer

<P>looked at.&nbsp; Young, pretty, and gentle, however, she had

<P>no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces,

<P>and there were few persons present that were not disposed

<P>to praise her.&nbsp; She was attractive, she was modest,

<P>she was Sir Thomas's niece, and she was soon said

<P>to be admired by Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; It was enough to give

<P>her general favour.&nbsp; Sir Thomas himself was watching

<P>her progress down the dance with much complacency;

<P>he was proud of his niece; and without attributing

<P>all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris seemed to do,

<P>to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased

<P>with himself for having supplied everything else:

<P>education and manners she owed to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas's thoughts as he stood,

<P>and having, in spite of all his wrongs towards her,

<P>a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him,

<P>took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something

<P>agreeable of Fanny.&nbsp; Her praise was warm, and he received

<P>it as she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion,

<P>and politeness, and slowness of speech would allow,

<P>and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the subject

<P>than his lady did soon afterwards, when Mary, perceiving her

<P>on a sofa very near, turned round before she began to dance,

<P>to compliment her on Miss Price's looks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she does look very well," was Lady Bertram's placid reply.

<P>"Chapman helped her to dress.&nbsp; I sent Chapman to her."

<P>Not but that she was really pleased to have Fanny admired;

<P>but she was so much more struck with her own kindness

<P>in sending Chapman to her, that she could not get it out

<P>of her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of

<P>gratifying _her_ by commendation of Fanny; to her, it was

<P>as the occasion offered--"Ah! ma'am, how much we want dear

<P>Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!" and Mrs. Norris paid

<P>her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had

<P>time for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself

<P>in making up card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas,

<P>and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her

<P>intentions to please.&nbsp; She meant to be giving her little

<P>heart a happy flutter, and filling her with sensations

<P>of delightful self-consequence; and, misinterpreting Fanny's

<P>blushes, still thought she must be doing so when she

<P>went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a

<P>significant look, "Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother

<P>goes to town to-morrow? He says he has business there,

<P>but will not tell me what.&nbsp; The first time he ever denied

<P>me his confidence!&nbsp; But this is what we all come to.

<P>All are supplanted sooner or later.&nbsp; Now, I must apply

<P>to you for information.&nbsp; Pray, what is Henry going for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her

<P>embarrassment allowed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then," replied Miss Crawford, laughing, "I must

<P>suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying

<P>your brother, and of talking of you by the way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent;

<P>while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought

<P>her over-anxious, or thought her odd, or thought her anything

<P>rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry's attentions.

<P>Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening;

<P>but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it.

<P>She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again

<P>so very soon, and she wished she had not been obliged

<P>to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris,

<P>about the supper hour, were all for the sake of securing her

<P>at that part of the evening.&nbsp; But it was not to be avoided:

<P>he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she

<P>could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there

<P>was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes,

<P>when he talked of William, he was really not unagreeable,

<P>and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit.

<P>But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction.

<P>She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how

<P>perfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes

<P>that she could walk about with him and hear his account

<P>of his partners; she was happy in knowing herself admired;

<P>and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still

<P>to look forward to, during the greatest part of the evening,

<P>her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite

<P>engagement with _him_ was in continual perspective.

<P>She was happy even when they did take place; but not from

<P>any flow of spirits on his side, or any such expressions

<P>of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.

<P>His mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from

<P>being the friend with whom it could find repose.

<P>"I am worn out with civility," said he.&nbsp; "I have been

<P>talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say.

<P>But with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace.&nbsp; You will not

<P>want to be talked to.&nbsp; Let us have the luxury of silence."

<P>Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement.&nbsp; A weariness,

<P>arising probably, in great measure, from the same feelings

<P>which he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly

<P>to be respected, and they went down their two dances together

<P>with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on

<P>that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his

<P>younger son.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure.&nbsp; Miss Crawford

<P>had been in gay spirits when they first danced together,

<P>but it was not her gaiety that could do him good:

<P>it rather sank than raised his comfort; and afterwards,

<P>for he found himself still impelled to seek her again,

<P>she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the

<P>profession to which he was now on the point of belonging.

<P>They had talked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned,

<P>she had ridiculed; and they had parted at last with

<P>mutual vexation.&nbsp; Fanny, not able to refrain entirely from

<P>observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied.

<P>It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering.

<P>Yet some happiness must and would arise from the very

<P>conviction that he did suffer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When her two dances with him were over, her inclination

<P>and strength for more were pretty well at an end;

<P>and Sir Thomas, having seen her walk rather than dance

<P>down the shortening set, breathless, and with her hand at

<P>her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely.

<P>From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor Fanny!" cried William, coming for a moment to visit her,

<P>and working away his partner's fan as if for life, "how soon

<P>she is knocked up!&nbsp; Why, the sport is but just begun.

<P>I hope we shall keep it up these two hours.&nbsp; How can you

<P>be tired so soon?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So soon! my good friend," said Sir Thomas, producing his

<P>watch with all necessary caution; "it is three o'clock,

<P>and your sister is not used to these sort of hours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before

<P>I go.&nbsp; Sleep as long as you can, and never mind me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; William."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!&nbsp; Did she think of being up before you set off?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes, sir," cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat

<P>to be nearer her uncle; "I must get up and breakfast with him.

<P>It will be the last time, you know; the last morning."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You had better not.&nbsp; He is to have breakfasted and be

<P>gone by half-past nine.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford, I think you call

<P>for him at half-past nine?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her

<P>eyes for denial; and it ended in a gracious "Well, well!"

<P>which was permission.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, half-past nine," said Crawford to William as the

<P>latter was leaving them, "and I shall be punctual,

<P>for there will be no kind sister to get up for _me_."

<P>And in a lower tone to Fanny, "I shall have only a desolate

<P>house to hurry from.&nbsp; Your brother will find my ideas

<P>of time and his own very different to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford

<P>to join the early breakfast party in that house

<P>instead of eating alone:&nbsp; he should himself be of it;

<P>and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted

<P>convinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess

<P>to himself, this very ball had in great measure sprung,

<P>were well founded.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny.

<P>He had a pleasing anticipation of what would be.&nbsp; His niece,

<P>meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had just done.

<P>She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning.

<P>It would have been an unspeakable indulgence.&nbsp; But though

<P>her wishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring

<P>within her.&nbsp; On the contrary, she was so totally unused

<P>to have her pleasure consulted, or to have anything take

<P>place at all in the way she could desire, that she was more

<P>disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point

<P>so far, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering

<P>a little with her inclination, by advising her to go

<P>immediately to bed.&nbsp; "Advise" was his word, but it

<P>was the advice of absolute power, and she had only

<P>to rise, and, with Mr. Crawford's very cordial adieus,

<P>pass quietly away; stopping at the entrance-door, like

<P>the Lady of Branxholm Hall, "one moment and no more,"

<P>to view the happy scene, and take a last look at the five

<P>or six determined couple who were still hard at work;

<P>and then, creeping slowly up the principal staircase,

<P>pursued by the ceaseless country-dance, feverish with hopes

<P>and fears, soup and negus, sore-footed and fatigued,

<P>restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite of everything,

<P>that a ball was indeed delightful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not

<P>be thinking merely of her health.&nbsp; It might occur to him

<P>that Mr. Crawford had been sitting by her long enough,

<P>or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing

<P>her persuadableness.
