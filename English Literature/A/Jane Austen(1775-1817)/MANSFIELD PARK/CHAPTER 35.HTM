<P>Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny

<P>to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford

<P>should be mentioned between them or not; and that if she

<P>did not lead the way, it should never be touched on by him;

<P>but after a day or two of mutual reserve, he was induced

<P>by his father to change his mind, and try what his influence

<P>might do for his friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for

<P>the Crawfords' departure; and Sir Thomas thought it

<P>might be as well to make one more effort for the young

<P>man before he left Mansfield, that all his professions

<P>and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much

<P>hope to sustain them as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection

<P>of Mr. Crawford's character in that point.&nbsp; He wished him

<P>to be a model of constancy; and fancied the best means

<P>of effecting it would be by not trying him too long.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage

<P>in the business; he wanted to know Fanny's feelings.

<P>She had been used to consult him in every difficulty,

<P>and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her

<P>confidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought

<P>he must be of service to her; whom else had she to open

<P>her heart to?&nbsp; If she did not need counsel, she must need

<P>the comfort of communication.&nbsp; Fanny estranged from him,

<P>silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of things;

<P>a state which he must break through, and which he could

<P>easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will speak to her, sir:&nbsp; I will take the first opportunity

<P>of speaking to her alone," was the result of such thoughts

<P>as these; and upon Sir Thomas's information of her

<P>being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery,

<P>he instantly joined her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am come to walk with you, Fanny," said he.&nbsp; "Shall I?"

<P>Drawing her arm within his.&nbsp; "It is a long while since we

<P>have had a comfortable walk together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She assented to it all rather by look than word.

<P>Her spirits were low.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, Fanny," he presently added, "in order to have a

<P>comfortable walk, something more is necessary than merely

<P>pacing this gravel together.&nbsp; You must talk to me.

<P>I know you have something on your mind.&nbsp; I know what you

<P>are thinking of.&nbsp; You cannot suppose me uninformed.

<P>Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, "If you

<P>hear of it from everybody, cousin, there can be nothing

<P>for me to tell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny.

<P>No one but you can tell me them.&nbsp; I do not mean to

<P>press you, however.&nbsp; If it is not what you wish yourself,

<P>I have done.&nbsp; I had thought it might be a relief."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid we think too differently for me to find

<P>any relief in talking of what I feel."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you suppose that we think differently?&nbsp; I have no idea

<P>of it.&nbsp; I dare say that, on a comparison of our opinions,

<P>they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be:

<P>to the point--I consider Crawford's proposals as most

<P>advantageous and desirable, if you could return his affection.

<P>I consider it as most natural that all your family

<P>should wish you could return it; but that, as you cannot,

<P>you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him.

<P>Can there be any disagreement between us here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no!&nbsp; But I thought you blamed me.&nbsp; I thought you

<P>were against me.&nbsp; This is such a comfort!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you

<P>sought it.&nbsp; But how could you possibly suppose me against you?

<P>How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love?

<P>Were I even careless in general on such matters, how could

<P>you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking

<P>to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right.

<P>I may be sorry, I may be surprised--though hardly _that_,

<P>for you had not had time to attach yourself--but I think

<P>you perfectly right.&nbsp; Can it admit of a question?

<P>It is disgraceful to us if it does.&nbsp; You did not love him;

<P>nothing could have justified your accepting him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite

<P>mistaken who wished you to do otherwise.&nbsp; But the matter

<P>does not end here.&nbsp; Crawford's is no common attachment;

<P>he perseveres, with the hope of creating that regard

<P>which had not been created before.&nbsp; This, we know,

<P>must be a work of time.&nbsp; But" (with an affectionate smile)

<P>"let him succeed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last.

<P>You have proved yourself upright and disinterested,

<P>prove yourself grateful and tender-hearted; and then you

<P>will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always

<P>believed you born for."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me."

<P>And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund,

<P>and which she blushed at the recollection of herself,

<P>when she saw his look, and heard him reply, "Never!&nbsp; Fanny!--

<P>so very determined and positive!&nbsp; This is not like yourself,

<P>your rational self."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I mean," she cried, sorrowfully correcting herself,

<P>"that I _think_ I never shall, as far as the future can

<P>be answered for; I think I never shall return his regard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must hope better things.&nbsp; I am aware, more aware

<P>than Crawford can be, that the man who means to make

<P>you love him (you having due notice of his intentions)

<P>must have very uphill work, for there are all your early

<P>attachments and habits in battle array; and before he

<P>can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it

<P>from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate,

<P>which so many years' growth have confirmed, and which are

<P>considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea

<P>of separation.&nbsp; I know that the apprehension of being

<P>forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you

<P>against him.&nbsp; I wish he had not been obliged to tell you

<P>what he was trying for.&nbsp; I wish he had known you as well as

<P>I do, Fanny.&nbsp; Between us, I think we should have won you.

<P>My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could

<P>not have failed.&nbsp; He should have worked upon my plans.

<P>I must hope, however, that time, proving him (as I firmly

<P>believe it will) to deserve you by his steady affection,

<P>will give him his reward.&nbsp; I cannot suppose that you have

<P>not the _wish_ to love him--the natural wish of gratitude.

<P>You must have some feeling of that sort.&nbsp; You must be sorry

<P>for your own indifference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We are so totally unlike," said Fanny, avoiding a

<P>direct answer, "we are so very, very different in all

<P>our inclinations and ways, that I consider it as quite

<P>impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together,

<P>even if I _could_ like him.&nbsp; There never were two people

<P>more dissimilar.&nbsp; We have not one taste in common.

<P>We should be miserable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are mistaken, Fanny.&nbsp; The dissimilarity is not so strong.

<P>You are quite enough alike.&nbsp; You _have_ tastes in common.

<P>You have moral and literary tastes in common.&nbsp; You have

<P>both warm hearts and benevolent feelings; and, Fanny,

<P>who that heard him read, and saw you listen to Shakespeare

<P>the other night, will think you unfitted as companions?

<P>You forget yourself:&nbsp; there is a decided difference

<P>in your tempers, I allow.&nbsp; He is lively, you are serious;

<P>but so much the better:&nbsp; his spirits will support yours.

<P>It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy

<P>difficulties greater than they are.&nbsp; His cheerfulness

<P>will counteract this.&nbsp; He sees difficulties nowhere:

<P>and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support

<P>to you.&nbsp; Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not in

<P>the smallest degree make against the probability of your

<P>happiness together:&nbsp; do not imagine it.&nbsp; I am myself

<P>convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance.

<P>I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike:

<P>I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, in the manners,

<P>in the inclination for much or little company, in the

<P>propensity to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay.

<P>Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced,

<P>friendly to matrimonial happiness.&nbsp; I exclude extremes,

<P>of course; and a very close resemblance in all those

<P>points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme.

<P>A counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard

<P>of manners and conduct."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now:

<P>Miss Crawford's power was all returning.&nbsp; He had been

<P>speaking of her cheerfully from the hour of his coming home.

<P>His avoiding her was quite at an end.&nbsp; He had dined at the

<P>Parsonage only the preceding day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes,

<P>Fanny, feeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford,

<P>and said, "It is not merely in _temper_ that I consider

<P>him as totally unsuited to myself; though, in _that_

<P>respect, I think the difference between us too great,

<P>infinitely too great:&nbsp; his spirits often oppress me;

<P>but there is something in him which I object to still more.

<P>I must say, cousin, that I cannot approve his character.

<P>I have not thought well of him from the time of the play.

<P>I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so very

<P>improperly and unfeelingly--I may speak of it now because

<P>it is all over--so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth,

<P>not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him,

<P>and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which--in short,

<P>at the time of the play, I received an impression which

<P>will never be got over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Fanny," replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her

<P>to the end, "let us not, any of us, be judged by what we

<P>appeared at that period of general folly.&nbsp; The time of the

<P>play is a time which I hate to recollect.&nbsp; Maria was wrong,

<P>Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but none

<P>so wrong as myself.&nbsp; Compared with me, all the rest

<P>were blameless.&nbsp; I was playing the fool with my eyes open."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As a bystander," said Fanny, "perhaps I saw more than

<P>you did; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes

<P>very jealous."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very possibly.&nbsp; No wonder.&nbsp; Nothing could be more improper

<P>than the whole business.&nbsp; I am shocked whenever I think

<P>that Maria could be capable of it; but, if she could

<P>undertake the part, we must not be surprised at the rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Before the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did

<P>not think he was paying her attentions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Julia!&nbsp; I have heard before from some one of his being

<P>in love with Julia; but I could never see anything of it.

<P>And, Fanny, though I hope I do justice to my sisters'

<P>good qualities, I think it very possible that they might,

<P>one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford,

<P>and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was

<P>perfectly prudent.&nbsp; I can remember that they were evidently

<P>fond of his society; and with such encouragement, a man

<P>like Crawford, lively, and it may be, a little unthinking,

<P>might be led on to--there could be nothing very striking,

<P>because it is clear that he had no pretensions:&nbsp; his heart

<P>was reserved for you.&nbsp; And I must say, that its being

<P>for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion.

<P>It does him the highest honour; it shews his proper estimation

<P>of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment.

<P>It proves him unspoilt by his uncle.&nbsp; It proves him, in short,

<P>everything that I had been used to wish to believe him,

<P>and feared he was not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought,

<P>on serious subjects."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious

<P>subjects, which I believe to be a good deal the case.

<P>How could it be otherwise, with such an education and adviser?

<P>Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have had,

<P>is it not wonderful that they should be what they are?

<P>Crawford's _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto

<P>been too much his guides.&nbsp; Happily, those feelings have

<P>generally been good.&nbsp; You will supply the rest; and a most

<P>fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature--

<P>to a woman who, firm as a rock in her own principles, has a

<P>gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them.

<P>He has chosen his partner, indeed, with rare felicity.

<P>He will make you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy;

<P>but you will make him everything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would not engage in such a charge," cried Fanny, in a

<P>shrinking accent; "in such an office of high responsibility!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything!

<P>fancying everything too much for you!&nbsp; Well, though I

<P>may not be able to persuade you into different feelings,

<P>you will be persuaded into them, I trust.

<P>I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may.

<P>I have no common interest in Crawford's well-doing. Next

<P>to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first claim on me.

<P>You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say;

<P>and they walked on together some fifty yards in mutual

<P>silence and abstraction.&nbsp; Edmund first began again--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking

<P>of it yesterday, particularly pleased, because I had not

<P>depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light.

<P>I knew she was very fond of you; but yet I was afraid

<P>of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite

<P>as it deserved, and of her regretting that he had not

<P>rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune.

<P>I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims, which she

<P>has been too much used to hear.&nbsp; But it was very different.

<P>She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought.&nbsp; She desires

<P>the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself.

<P>We had a long talk about it.&nbsp; I should not have mentioned

<P>the subject, though very anxious to know her sentiments;

<P>but I had not been in the room five minutes before she

<P>began introducing it with all that openness of heart,

<P>and sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness

<P>which are so much a part of herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant laughed

<P>at her for her rapidity."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters

<P>together by themselves; and when once we had begun,

<P>we had not done with you, Fanny, till Crawford and Dr. Grant

<P>came in."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best.

<P>You will see her, however, before she goes.&nbsp; She is very

<P>angry with you, Fanny; you must be prepared for that.

<P>She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her anger.

<P>It is the regret and disappointment of a sister,

<P>who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may

<P>wish for, at the first moment.&nbsp; She is hurt, as you would

<P>be for William; but she loves and esteems you with all

<P>her heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I knew she would be very angry with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest Fanny," cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer

<P>to him, "do not let the idea of her anger distress you.

<P>It is anger to be talked of rather than felt.&nbsp; Her heart

<P>is made for love and kindness, not for resentment.

<P>I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise;

<P>I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said

<P>that you _should_ be Henry's wife.&nbsp; And I observed that she

<P>always spoke of you as 'Fanny,' which she was never used to do;

<P>and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And Mrs. Grant, did she say--did she speak; was she

<P>there all the time?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister.&nbsp; The surprise

<P>of your refusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded.

<P>That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems

<P>more than they can understand.&nbsp; I said what I could for you;

<P>but in good truth, as they stated the case--you must

<P>prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can

<P>by a different conduct; nothing else will satisfy them.

<P>But this is teasing you.&nbsp; I have done.&nbsp; Do not turn away

<P>from me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I _should_ have thought," said Fanny, after a pause

<P>of recollection and exertion, "that every woman must

<P>have felt the possibility of a man's not being approved,

<P>not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let him

<P>be ever so generally agreeable.&nbsp; Let him have all the

<P>perfections in the world, I think it ought not to be set

<P>down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every

<P>woman he may happen to like himself.&nbsp; But, even supposing

<P>it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims

<P>which his sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared

<P>to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own?

<P>He took me wholly by surprise.&nbsp; I had not an idea that

<P>his behaviour to me before had any meaning; and surely I

<P>was not to be teaching myself to like him only because

<P>he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me.

<P>In my situation, it would have been the extreme of vanity

<P>to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; I am sure

<P>his sisters, rating him as they do, must have thought it so,

<P>supposing he had meant nothing.&nbsp; How, then, was I to be--

<P>to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me?

<P>How was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon

<P>as it was asked for?&nbsp; His sisters should consider me

<P>as well as him.&nbsp; The higher his deserts, the more improper

<P>for me ever to have thought of him.&nbsp; And, and--we think

<P>very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine

<P>a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection

<P>as this seems to imply."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth.&nbsp; I know this

<P>to be the truth; and most worthy of you are such feelings.

<P>I had attributed them to you before.&nbsp; I thought I could

<P>understand you.&nbsp; You have now given exactly the explanation

<P>which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant,

<P>and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-hearted

<P>friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm

<P>of her fondness for Henry.&nbsp; I told them that you were

<P>of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most

<P>power and novelty least; and that the very circumstance

<P>of the novelty of Crawford's addresses was against him.

<P>Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour;

<P>that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to;

<P>and a great deal more to the same purpose, to give them

<P>a knowledge of your character.&nbsp; Miss Crawford made us

<P>laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother.

<P>She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being

<P>loved in time, and of having his addresses most kindly

<P>received at the end of about ten years' happy marriage."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was

<P>here asked for.&nbsp; Her feelings were all in revolt.

<P>She feared she had been doing wrong:&nbsp; saying too much,

<P>overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary;

<P>in guarding against one evil, laying herself open

<P>to another; and to have Miss Crawford's liveliness

<P>repeated to her at such a moment, and on such a subject,

<P>was a bitter aggravation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face,

<P>and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion;

<P>and not even to mention the name of Crawford again,

<P>except as it might be connected with what _must_ be agreeable

<P>to her.&nbsp; On this principle, he soon afterwards observed--

<P>"They go on Monday.&nbsp; You are sure, therefore, of seeing

<P>your friend either to-morrow or Sunday.&nbsp; They really go

<P>on Monday; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded

<P>to stay at Lessingby till that very day!&nbsp; I had almost

<P>promised it.&nbsp; What a difference it might have made!

<P>Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been

<P>felt all my life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You were near staying there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very.&nbsp; I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented.

<P>Had I received any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you

<P>were all going on, I believe I should certainly have staid;

<P>but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight,

<P>and felt that I had been away long enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You spent your time pleasantly there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not.

<P>They were all very pleasant.&nbsp; I doubt their finding me so.

<P>I took uneasiness with me, and there was no getting rid

<P>of it till I was in Mansfield again."

<P>"The Miss Owens--you liked them, did not you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very well.&nbsp; Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls.

<P>But I am spoilt, Fanny, for common female society.

<P>Good-humoured, unaffected girls will not do for a man

<P>who has been used to sensible women.&nbsp; They are two distinct

<P>orders of being.&nbsp; You and Miss Crawford have made me

<P>too nice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Still, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied;

<P>he saw it in her looks, it could not be talked away;

<P>and attempting it no more, he led her directly, with the

<P>kind authority of a privileged guardian, into the house.
